Greg Foot visits Battersea Cats and Dogs Home to get up close and personal with our feline friends, and see how they have the ability to manipulate and control humans.
Cats… aren’t they lovely, cute and fluffy? Think again. These loveable pets are fantastic at being able to control the human mind. Here’s how:
One: Cats may look like they are into you, but they really aren’t.
Two: Cats have created the perfect purr to make you feed them.
Three: Cats may infect you with a parasite that rewires your brain and affects your behaviour.
