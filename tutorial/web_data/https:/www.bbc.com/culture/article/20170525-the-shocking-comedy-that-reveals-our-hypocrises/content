The Square is a dark satire from the director of Force Majeure that stars Elisabeth Moss, Claes Bang and Dominic West. Rebecca Laurence takes a look from Cannes - watch the video.
Christian is a successful curator in a modern art gallery who seems to have it all. Not only is he handsome and wealthy, he’s a caring father, drives an electric car and gives regularly to charity.
But when he is robbed of his mobile phone, the vigilante action that he takes leads his life to unravel in bizarre, shocking and disturbing ways – and reveals his true character.
This is the premise of The Square, a blacker-than-black satire on the art world, bourgeois society and masculinity. Swedish director Ruben Östlund uses humour and satire to say important things about the hypocrisies in our own lives. Watch the video above to find out more.
