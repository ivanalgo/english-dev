The car park that caught fire at Luton Airport will have to be "fully demolished", the airport confirmed. 
The fire broke out on level three of Terminal Car Park 2 on 10 October and was thought to have started in a diesel car before spreading rapidly. 
The airport said any cars parked on levels ground to three "are not recoverable". 
However a process is still "ongoing" to remove around 100 vehicles from the top deck. 
Neil Thompson, operations director at the airport, said: "Regrettably, I can now confirm that, due to the extent of the structural damage, the car park will need to be fully demolished." 
The decision was confirmed by a "full structural report". 
Mr Thompson said removal of around 100 vehicles from the top deck was still under way "to stabilise the structure". 
"This has been a painstaking task and has taken longer than expected, not least because we have been hampered by periods of bad weather and strong winds," he said. 
He advised anybody who believed their car was on the top deck to contact their insurance companies, which were working to retrieve those vehicles. 
"It is reassuring to note that the vast majority of insurance claims have been settled," Mr Thompson added. 
"Customers who have yet to receive a final settlement are advised to contact their insurance company as soon as possible. 
"On behalf of everyone at London Luton Airport, I would like to thank all affected customers for their patience and understanding as we have worked through this unprecedented situation."
