Older people are struggling to make ends meet in London's private rental market, according to new polling data.
More than half of over-55s renting in the capital worry about getting into debt, according to YouGov statistics.
And nearly a third said their housing situation affects their mental health.
The government said it is passing legislation to make renting fairer for tenants and is providing Â£104bn in cost of living support.
The number of people over 55 who are renting privately has risen by more than 70% in the last decade, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
There are an estimated 84,717 older private renting households in London.
Older private rented households are defined as those which have at least one person over 55 living there.
The National Housing Federation (NHF), which analysed the data, found that while London's proportion of these households is relatively low compared to other parts of England, their experience appears to be worse.
It found that in the capital, more older private renters were worried about debt, their mental health and their reduced ability to see friends and family due to the cost of rent.
Kate Henderson, NHF's chief executive, said the analysis shows the aging population is being hit in "devastating ways".
She said: "The health of older private renters is at risk as hundreds of thousands struggle to buy food and heat their homes
"And when seeing friends and family is too expensive, this leads to loneliness and isolation."
A government spokesperson said the upcoming Renters (Reform) Bill will deliver a "fairer, more secure, and higher quality private rented sector".
They added the government was on track to build one million homes this Parliament.
