A North East airport has said it is disappointed after an airline cancelled flights to Cornwall.
Loganair has suspended routes at Newquay airport in Cornwall, affecting services to and from Teesside and Newcastle airports.
The move has come as part of a dispute between the airline and the Cornish airport.
Teesside Airport said it would "continue to work with numerous airline partners" to find other routes.
The seasonal service between Teesside and Newquay had been due to stop at the end of October anyway but the airline has said it has also decided to "curtail" its summer 2023 plans as well, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
A Loganair spokesman said the decision had been made with a "heavy heart".
A spokesman for Teesside Airport, which has recorded losses of Â£11.8m and also lost a route to London earlier this year, said: "We are disappointed to see Loganair has pulled its routes to Newquay on what appears to be a disagreement between the airline and Newquay-Cornwall airport. 
"We continue to work with numerous airline partners to look at growing our route connectivity."
Newcastle Airport said Loganair flights to Newquay would end on 27 October but the route would resume in March 2023.
A spokesman said there would still be "year-round" Loganair flights to Exeter.
