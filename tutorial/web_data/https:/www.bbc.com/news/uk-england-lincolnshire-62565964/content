A clean-up operation is under way after "waist-high" water flooded homes and streets in a Lincolnshire town. 
The exact number of properties affected in Market Rasen is not known as authorities are yet to assess the damage.
However, Councillor Stephen Bunney said he had spoken with "at least six residents" on Wednesday who had water enter their homes. 
He confirmed the water had receded, with only "a few puddles" remaining.
Mr Bunney said flooding was mainly the result of "cars driving up and down streets, which caused waves" and that in places, water levels were "waist-high".
Two properties were evacuated and firefighters are "very busy" pumping water out of several properties, Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Service said.  
Torrential rain passed over the town at about 17:00 BST on Tuesday, which Mr Bunney described as "pretty bad" by 18:00.
He said he expected council teams to arrive shortly to assess the damage.
Meanwhile, flooding closed several roads, although Lincolnshire County Council said all but one had since reopened. 
West Marsh Road in Spalding remains closed after a factory flooded, it said. Diversions are in place.
Councillor Richard Davies, executive member for highways, said: "To have the roads back to normal in such a short period of time is testimony to the hard work of our crews and everyone involved in a rapid response." 
Elsewhere in Lincolnshire, Co-op staff in Louth have been mopping up water that entered the store. 
Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Service said it had received more than 100 flood-related calls while the council said more than 250 sandbags were handed out in Market Rasen, Louth, Spalding, Pinchbeck and Welton.
