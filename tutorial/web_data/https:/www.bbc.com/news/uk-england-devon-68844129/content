A fully accessible toilet facility has been installed in a leisure centre in Tiverton.
Exe Valley Leisure Centre is now home to a Changing Places toilet, which includes a rise and fall sink, changing bench, hoist and space for carers
Mid Devon District Council secured a grant of more than Â£150,000 towards creating the facilities.
Culm Valley Sports Centre in Cullompton is also set to benefit with its toilet due to be completed later this year.
The funding is part of the Changing Places fund, which aims to support disabled people with improved access and is administered by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.
Councillor David Wulff, cabinet member for Community and Leisure, said: "I'm delighted that we can celebrate the completion of the first of two accessible toilets at our leisure sites.
"I would like to say thank you to the MS Society who have provided valuable insight and advice on the best layout and design for these new facilities.
"Changing Places toilets are larger, truly accessible toilets for disabled people. 
"Regardless of ability, everyone is welcome at our leisure centres."
