Anti-Israel graffiti has been daubed on a war memorial in Lewisham, prompting a police investigation to find the culprits.
Vandals are believed to have targeted the monument between midday on Sunday 12 November and 09:00 on Monday 13 November.
The graffiti has since been removed by the local authority.
Police have appealed for anyone who was near Lewisham High Street at the time who may have seen those responsible.
PC Andrew Dobson from the Met Police said: "We know that incidents like this cause significant concern in our communities and we will be relentless in targeting those who commit such offences."
