Budget brand Wilko will return to Rotherham later this year as part of a national roll-out.
The homeware chain collapsed into administration last year, but its brand was bought by CDS Superstores in a Â£5m deal.
The firm, which owns The Range, said in October it was planning to bring Wilko back to the high street with new shops.
It has confirmed that will include the former Wilko site at Rotherham's Parkgate Shopping Park.
The company said it would continue to try to give former Wilko employees priority during the recruitment process.
When CDS acquired the brand, it intended to stock some Wilko products in its shops, but was not expected to open stores under the name.
The firm said the decision was due to the popularity of Wilko with consumers.
Stores were opened in Plymouth, Exeter and Luton late last year.
CDS Superstores chief executive officer Alex Simpkin said the initial reaction had been better than the company had hoped.
"We've seen queues of both returning and new customers at the store launches and the feedback is giving us the confidence we need to continue with our store opening plans," he said.
"We're in advanced negotiations with a number of landlords and are continuing to review all options as a part of our roll-out plan."
According to the firm, the store in Rotherham will reopen in the spring.
