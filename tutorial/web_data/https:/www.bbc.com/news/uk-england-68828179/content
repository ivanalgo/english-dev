A lorry driver has admitted to causing a crash on the M25 that killed four people travelling in a minibus.
Essex Police was called to the motorway near Waltham Abbey to reports of a crash involving a minibus, car and HGV on 23 August 2021.
Three people - aged between 31 and 60 - died at the scene while a fourth died later from her injuries.
Ethan Burdett, 67, from Ipswich, pleaded guilty to four offences of causing death by careless driving.
He will be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court in July, a hearing earlier was told.
Police shut the M25 for 11 hours on the day of the crash after officers arrived at about 18:15 BST.
Abigael Muamba, 31, Dexter Augustus, 60, and Jennifer Smith, 59, all from London, died at the scene.
Lisa Gardiner, 44, also from London, died later from her injuries. All four victims had been travelling inside a minibus.
Burdett, of Haven Marina, Ipswich, was due to stand trial but wept in the dock as he changed his pleas to guilty earlier.
Judge Christopher Morgan warned Burdett they were "serious offences" as he released Burdett on conditional bail until sentencing.
In statements previously released by Essex Police, the victims' families paid tribute to each of them.
The family of Ms Smith, a service manager from Stratford, said she was a "popular figure within her community" who was "loved beyond words".
Mr Augustus, from Waltham Forest, was a "dearly loved son, brother, father, grandfather and friend to everyone that knew him", his family said.
Ms Gardiner, from Walthamstow, was a "beautiful wife and mother", her family said.
"Always full of life, Lisa's big heart knew no bounds; love and life was there to be shared," they added.
The parents of Ms Muamba, of Edmonton Green, said they missed her "smile and dedication", and they would always remember her "helpful heart and youthful spirit".
