A woman has been found guilty of killing a toddler who had been left in her care.
Shannon Driver, 27, from Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, claimed 18-month-old Jaxon Syrett had slipped in the shower on 18 September 2020.
But doctors found the boy, who died six days later, had suffered significant "non-accidental" injuries.
Driver was convicted of manslaughter at Lewes Crown Court on Wednesday, and will be sentenced on 27 March.
She had initially called police to a property in London Road to report the child's injuries, after being left to look after him while his father was at work.
In a statement, Jaxon's family said: "The tragic loss of Jaxon has changed our lives forever. We will never see Jaxon's cheeky smile again, nor hear his infectious laugh and will miss every milestone Jaxon had to reach.
"We as a family hold and cherish every memory we have of Jaxon.
"We would like to thank everyone who has been involved with this investigation, and in getting a conviction and some kind of justice for our baby."
Investigator Dick Hemmings said: "No family should have to go through what Jaxon's have experienced, and I would like to extend my heartfelt condolences for their devastating loss.
"No judicial outcome can make up for this tragedy, but with this conviction we can look ahead to sentencing and the conclusion of this process."
