A town of 20,000 is to keep its pop-up Post Office after a reprieve a day after its closure was announced. 
The service in Sudbury, Suffolk, closed in June 2022 and was replaced two weeks later with a pop-up branch. 
On Thursday, the national Post Office said it would close because the postmaster had decided to withdraw the service, off King Street, from Friday.
A spokesman has now confirmed the branch was open and "for now it will continue to operate as normal".
After the closure of the branch in WH Smith, the pop-up opened in May and residents hoped it would become permanent. 
The national office had said that would not be the case and a spokesman "apologised for any inconvenience".
People in the town were told the nearest alternative services would be at Great Cornard, just over a mile (1.6km) away, or Great Waldingfield, four miles (6.2km) away. 
The Post Office originally said: "We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by this closure at short notice. 
"We are currently reviewing service provision for Sudbury and will share a further update as soon as we can."
On Friday, a spokeswoman for the national Post Office in London said: "We are pleased to announce that Sudbury Post Office will no longer be closing today as planned and for now it will continue to operate as normal at 8 Borehamgate, King Street, Sudbury, CO10 2EG."
