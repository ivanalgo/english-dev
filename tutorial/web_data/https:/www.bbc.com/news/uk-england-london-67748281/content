A 40-year-old from east London has completed 365 marathons in 365 days and is showing no sign of stopping. 
Aaron Robinson wakes up at 03:00 every day to run a marathon around Wanstead Flats with his two dogs, River and Inca.
Then he does a full day's work.
Reflecting on his year of marathons, he said: "I think it's just routine to be honest. I'm not motivated most days, but you kind of get into the habit of it."
Mr Robinson takes an average of five hours to complete each run and has tracked them all on an app, unofficially exceeding the men's Guinness World Record of 82 consecutive days of running a marathon. 
The official women's record is 106 consecutive days.
But he has set his sights on beating what he says is the unofficial record of 607 marathons in 607 days.
"If the dogs want to carry on, we'll carry on," he said.
"The record is 607. I would love to get that. We're going to do as many as we possibly can."
He is raising money for Hope for Justice, a charity that works to stop human trafficking.
"Any struggles I go through are nothing compared to what victims of modern day slavery and human trafficking go through," he added.
"It does keep me going."
