A building hosting Labour Party conference events had to be evacuated after a World War Two "training device" was found.
The Museum of Liverpool on the city's Pier Head was cleared by a police bomb disposal unit at 10:50 BST.
The device was deemed safe and posed no risk to the public, although police did not explain precisely what the device was.
The museum, which was temporarily closed as a precaution, has reopened. 
The IPPR North think tank, which was due to hold an event inside the museum, was forced to decamp to nearby Albert Dock. 
The group subsequently had to move their fringe event to the Tate Liverpool gallery. 
Merseyside Police thanked people for their concern and said the force "responds immediately to any incidents of concern for safety and the safety of residents and visitors in our region is paramount".
