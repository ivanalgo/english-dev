A strike by fire control room staff just after Christmas has been shelved after a deal to end a shifts dispute was made.
Members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) on Merseyside were due to walk out for eight days from 27 December.
But a revised offer was accepted after last-minute talks with Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service.
FBU said it improved the work-life balance of control room staff and introduced an agreed duty shift system.
It would involve a pay uplift of Â£6,880 a year.
Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: "This is a positive outcome for both fire control staff and the wider public on Merseyside, and demonstrates clearly the benefits of collective bargaining.
"By sitting down with our employers, we were able to hammer out an agreement which was acceptable to all parties."
He said the agreement would "substantially improve the work-life balance for staff".
"It was only possible because of the hard work and determination of local members and officials, and because of the solidarity they received from their colleagues and the wider community," he added. 
A spokesman for Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service said: 'We are very pleased to advise that the authority have reached agreement with the Fire Brigades Union.
"This follows extensive and constructive dialogue locally and nationally.
"The proposal achieves our ambition to continuously improve, reflects the demands placed on the service and improves our resilience whilst meeting the aspirations of our teams in fire control.
"We hope all our staff in fire control can now enjoy the festive period, looking forward to the New Year."
Union members had initially voted to strike in August.
