A nurse has been struck off for prescribing controlled drugs to her relatives and booking fake patient appointments.
Nina Groves' fitness to practise was found to be impaired by "reason of misconduct" by a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) tribunal.
She was employed by the Clee Medical Centre (CMC) in Cleethorpes, but quit after the practice launched an inquiry.
Mrs Groves did not attend and was not represented at the NMC hearing.
The panel was told that the charges relate to events that occurred between 2015 and 2019.
In its report, the tribunal found Mrs Groves:
A witness, who worked at CMC, told the inquiry: "I believe that Nina was booking additional appointments in order to have more free time, extended lunchbreaks and finish work early."
Another witness, who worked alongside Mrs Groves, said: "The duplicated bookings would often be the last appointment of the day which would enable Nina to finish work early when the patient did not arrive.
"She would make notes describing how she had examined the patient, but this was not true."
The witness added "Nina would also often generate a prescription for herself, her relatives and other patients without a consultation".
The tribunal was told Mrs Groves prescribed diazepam and "inappropriately high quantities of codeine", which as controlled drugs she had no authorisation to issue.
Panel members concluded there "was a breach of a position of trust" and "Mrs Groves' dishonesty carried on over a lengthy period of time" leading to "a serious risk of harm to patients".
