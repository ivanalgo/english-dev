An Everton fan who mocked the Munich air disaster during a match at Manchester United's Old Trafford ground has been banned from stadiums.
Mark Finnigan pleaded guilty to making offensive gestures in front of the home crowd during a clash between the teams last month. 
The 24-year-old was banned for attending matches for three years. 
John Moran of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said so-called tragedy chanting "was never acceptable".
"Mark Finnigan's offensive gesture, made in full view of home and away fans, has landed him a football banning order, stopping him from watching the sport he loves," he added.
Finnigan was seen turning to United supporters during Everton's 2-0 defeat in the Premier League on 9 March, prosecutors said.
Police saw him make a gesture appearing to mock the 1958 plane crash which killed 23 people, including eight Manchester United players and three club staff. 
He was arrested and later sentenced at Manchester Magistrates court. 
As well as a stadium ban, Finnnigan was ordered to pay a victim surcharge and prosecution costs as he was handed a six-month conditional discharge.
