The proposed devolution deal for Greater Lincolnshire rests “in the hands of the minister”, according to Councillor Martin Hill, the conservative leader of the county council.The deal, announced in the chancellor's Autumn Statement last year, would transfer power and funds to local government and give elected representatives more control over decision making.However, government approval for the deal – which would include an elected mayor from 2025 – was put on hold due to the general election.“I hope the new government will pick up those plans and agreements so they can progress,” Mr Hill said.
Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner is in charge of the department responsible for approving the deal, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.In the run-up to the election on 4 July, Labour promised to devolve more powers over transport, skills, employment support, housing and planning to local councils and mayors.Since coming to power, Ms Rayner has said the government is focused on a “full reset of our relationship with local government”.
Mr Hill added: “It’s really positive news that the government has given a strong commitment to devolution, which we welcome very much.”While there is no timescale for the government’s response on the issue, the councillor said it was a case of “the sooner, the better”, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.The Greater Lincolnshire deal would include a combined mayoral authority for Lincolnshire, North East Lincolnshire and North Lincolnshire. It promises to deliver £24m annually to the region for the next 30 years.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
