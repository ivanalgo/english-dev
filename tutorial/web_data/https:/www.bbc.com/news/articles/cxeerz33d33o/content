A former children's charity worker and imam has been jailed for grooming a boy online.Umar Dawood, from Redditch in Worcestershire, taught children in the area and also volunteered at the children's charity, West Mercia Police said.The 36-year-old pleaded guilty to three charges at an earlier hearing and was sentenced to three years in prison at Worcester Crown Court.He was also given a sexual harm prevention order and ordered to register as a sex offender.
Dawood, of Evesham Road, was jailed on June 10 after admitting to causing a boy under 13 to engage in sexual activity.He was also given a nine-month concurrent sentence for attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child as an adult, and a one-month concurrent sentence for possessing extreme pornography. Det Sgt Pete Wheeler, of West Mercia Police’s child sexual exploitation team, said: “Dawood previously held a position of trust and was a local imam teaching children within the local community. He also volunteered with a local children’s charity.“The outcome of this investigation goes some way to ensuring that he is not able to work with children in the future, and we hope will provide some reassurance that this offending has attracted a custodial sentence.”
