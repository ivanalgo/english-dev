Road closures and yellow lines are among measures aimed at tackling continuing traffic problems at two neighbouring schools in Dorset.Inconsiderate parking near St Osmund’s and Manor Park schools in Dorchester has led to complaints from residents.Road closures were introduced in Barnes Way at school drop-off and pick-up times in March.Single yellow lines are now being proposed on neighbouring streets to stop parents blocking residential roads and driveways.
Wooden posts have also been installed to stop drivers parking on verges, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.The latest proposal by Dorset Council - for no-waiting zones on one side of Mellstock Avenue and Rothesay Road - would apply from Monday to Friday, between 08:00 and 09:00 and 15:00 to 16:00.At a meeting of Dorset Town Council's planning and environment committee, councillor Molly Rennie said the schools had previously worked with parents and residents on their own informal parking rules but the problems had resurfaced.She said: "People are again ignoring the rules. Unless we support this we will be back to chaos again. It only affects a short period of time a couple of times a day."Councillor Robin Potter agreed but said the plan would only work if it was enforced by traffic wardens.In addition to the single yellow lines, the proposals would also allow improved access to Barnes Way residents during the restricted times, and double yellow lines would be painted on the junction of Mellstock Avenue and Rothesay Road.Residents have until 19 July to submit comments to Dorset Council.
