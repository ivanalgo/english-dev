Grassroots sports clubs give children "a sense of belonging and strengthen communities", a report has said.The University of Bath conducted research at 12 clubs in Bristol, Manchester and London, and found that 74% of children attending felt a sense of belonging.A report based on the research said clubs can help divert kids away from anti-social behaviour.Dr. Haydn Morgan, who led the research, told BBC Radio Somerset: "Sports clubs are a type of gang really – a more positive gang that young people become apart of and create their identity."
The study with the Department for Health at the University of Bath and Access Sport involved 270 children across England.Access Sport said it shows the transformational impact of community sport and suggests it has been undervalued.Dr Morgan added: "For young people, a lot of them have social insolation because of the Covid-19 pandemic. "It’s really how clubs can make those connections with people their own age and other inter-generational connections."If young people feel like they are belonging to a sports club – they can gain the social, emotional, mental and physical benefits from it and reap the rewards."
Dr Morgan continued saying parents find the clubs are "massive community hubs".He said: "The opportunity for parents to take them down to their local sports club helps them network and share stories."My advice is get your kids to a sports club!"
