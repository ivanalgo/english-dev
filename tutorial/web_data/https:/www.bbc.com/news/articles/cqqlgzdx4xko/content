An event offering free heart scans for young people was held on Sunday, organised by the parents of a 26-year-old who died after going into cardiac arrest.Anthony Lane had been using an exercise bike when his heart stopped.Anthony's father Paul Lane said: "We're hoping that in some way they don't find anything but in others if they do find something in the screening then potentially we've saved somebody's life, that will be a fantastic tribute to Anthony."People aged 14-34 were invited to Sutton Coldfield football club for the free screenings.
According to the British Heart Foundation, an estimated 12 people under the age of 35 die every week as the result of undiagnosed heart conditions. The event was funded by the charity Cardiac Arrest in the Young and Wylde Green Rotary Club.Anthony's mother Penny said the non-invasive way of diagnosing heart abnormalities was the perfect way of honouring her son. "I've got to believe that his memory can be continued and he's going to be leaving a legacy of saving lives of young people," she said.
