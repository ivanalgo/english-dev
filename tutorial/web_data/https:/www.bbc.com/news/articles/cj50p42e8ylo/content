Plans to extend a town's controversial cycle lane have been approved by councillors.The second phase of the project in Castleton, Greater Manchester, will see the cycleway extended to Rochdale town centre, and includes new junctions along the A58 Manchester Road.Some local businesses had criticised the first phase of the scheme, blaming a loss of parking space on the main road and project delays for a downturn in trade. Rochdale councillor Shah Wazir said although the next phase would cause "short-term" disruption, the scheme would be "really beneficial for our borough".
Work on the next part of the scheme is expected to begin later this year, with the entire project due for completion in 2026.The cycle lane along Castleton's high street was finished in January under a Â£4.4m scheme that included wider improvements to the road network. Rochdale Borough Council previously said the success of the scheme could not be judged until the cycle routes, designed to encourage active travel, were "fully connected". Under the next phase, the track will be extended from the Royal Toby Hotel into Rochdale town centre.It would be built alongside stretches of Old Manchester Road, which runs parallel to Manchester Road so no parking or road space is taken away.New crossings and junctions are also planned, along with 20mph speed limits and road humps. About 70% of more than 400 respondents to a council survey in September last year opposed the second phase of the project.The council has included new individual section deadlines and incentives for contractors into the plan to prevent any delays to the scheme. Mr Wazir said the project was going to "improve traffic capacity by at least 20%".
