A music promoter has said he is fulfilling a "lifetime ambition" by arranging a series of concerts in his hometown.Colin Oliver's company Futuresound is hosting James, Elbow, Anne Marie and Madness at Ludlow Castle, in Shropshire, this month.He said it was "good to bring some popular culture to Ludlow" and that it was a "buzz to bring it to my home town".Earlier this year the company received permission from Shropshire Council to stage up to eight days of live music at the 11th Century castle.
Mr Oliver has spent 30 years in the music business. He said he started with putting on gigs for bands in small venues, before moving to Leeds where he worked with artists including Muse, Coldplay, Ed Sheeran and Kaiser Chiefs.
Futuresound has also announced it has signed a five-year deal with the castle to continue the events.He said it was a relief because international rivals had been taking an interest and might have wanted to step in and "take all the fun".The company said 20,000 are expected to attend this summer's series of four concerts at Ludlow Castle, between 25 and 28 July.
