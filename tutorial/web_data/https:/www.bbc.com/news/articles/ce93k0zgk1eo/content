A coffee drive-thru can be built at a hotel near the M40 after councillors reluctantly gave planning permission amid fears of traffic problems.Members of Warwick District Council’s planning committee gave the green light to proposals for the new shop on the site of the Marriott Hotel, Stratford Road, Warwick.The hotel is accessed from the Longbridge roundabout that serves junction 15 of the M40 motorway and has a shared access with a private cul-de-sac of homes.Councillors argued there was sufficient provision in the area already with Warwick Services about six miles south of junction 15.
The planning report stated the “proposal aims to predominantly serve passing trade from the M40 corridor” but contends that “it would be hard to argue that there are any other town centre or sequentially preferential sites available to accommodate such a use”.There was no objection from Warwickshire County Council’s highways department, although keep clear markings are to be included to prevent those turning back out of the site from blocking the route into Warwick.Councillors including John Holland, Labour county councillor for Warwick West, aired their concerns about the proposals causing a build of traffic in an already busy area.Untimately the committee decided they were unable to object and the plans were agreed.
