A man has been arrested following the seizure of more than €8m worth of suspected illegal drugs and €1m in cash. An Garda Síochána (Irish police) carried out a search operation under warrant at a residence in The Ward, Dublin 11 on Friday evening. Substances seized in the raid include suspected cocaine, cannabis, ketamine, LSD and MDMA. They will now be sent to Forensic Science Ireland (FSI) to undergo analysis. The arrested man, aged in his 50s, is being detained at a Garda station in the Dublin area. 
Further cash, vehicles and designer goods were seized in a number of follow-up searches across the Dublin Metropolitan Region. "The seizure of what is a significant quantity of drugs and cash is a major blow to this organised crime group which has been causing so much misery in communities right across the city," Dublin's Assistant Commissioner Angela Willis said. "Cash is the lifeblood of crime groups and the seizure of amounts of this scale causes significant disruption," she said. "Gardaí continue to target those that destroy lives through their activities."
