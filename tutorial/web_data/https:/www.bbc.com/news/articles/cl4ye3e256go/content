Westminster's standards watchdog has told the BBC he has been running training schemes to help MPs remember they are "not special" outside the House of Commons, despite their position. Daniel Greenberg told Radio 4's Today in Parliament programme new MPs could often struggle to realise they had "extraordinarily special" privileges in the Commons chamber, but were "absolutely ordinary" outside it.The parliamentary commissioner for standards said that since the election, he had been running seminars on how MPs could avoid common pitfalls. In the past, one issue has been the power differential between MPs and parliamentary staff.  
Since taking over as commissioner in January 2023, Mr Greenberg has focused on building trust and confidence between MPs and the public.He told the BBC: "When somebody comes from outside and becomes an MP, they have to grasp for the first time that, in some ways, they are extraordinarily special.  "In the chamber - they are constitutionally completely special.  "They can even say things in the chamber that would be a criminal offence if they said them outside the chamber." But he added it was often "quite hard for them to realise then, that as soon as they come out of the chamber, and they're in the lunch queue, they are absolutely ordinary - and to get their heads round that".MPs were given priority in Parliament's cafeterias, allowing them to jump the queue, until recently - but this practice has ended.Since taking the job Mr Greenberg, has investigated a string of allegations of sexual misconduct, lobbying and declarations of interest. One investigation found former Tory whip Chris Pincher had drunkenly groped two men at London's Carlton Club.Following the inquiry, the House of Commons Standards Committee concluded his actions had been "profoundly damaging" to Parliament's reputation.Mr Greenberg also launched an investigation into Rishi Sunak, then prime minister, over his failure to declare a financial interest related to a childminding agency, Koru Kids, benefiting from a government scheme.Mr Sunak apologised for not declaring the shares, which belonged to his wife. Akshata Murty.The parliamentary commissioner for standards oversees the system that investigates complaints against MPs over their code of conduct.The commissioner reports findings to the parliamentary standards committee, which has the power to impose sanctions including, in serious circumstances, suspending MPs and triggering by-elections.Following the election, Mr Greenberg has made a point of greeting new MPs as they entered the building at Westminster.Despite the complexity of Parliament's rules, Mr Greenberg said he advised MPs to concentrate on the principles and morals underpinning them.He said he wanted MPs to stop and ask themselves when they took part in debates: "Might a reasonable person think I'm being influenced in some way by a financial interest?"You can hear the full interview with Daniel Greenberg on Today in Parliament at 23:30 BST on Friday on Radio 4, or listen later on BBC Sounds.
