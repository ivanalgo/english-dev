NHS Borders wants to install more than 1,000 ground-mounted solar panels next to the region's main hospital. The health board has applied for planning permissions to erect 1,152 panels on an unused grassed area south of Borders General Hospital in Melrose. It is part of its plans to achieve net zero by 2040. NHS Borders said the installation was estimated to cost about £715,000, with estimated net annual energy cost savings of £82,000. 
In November 2023 the health board secured a grant from a Scottish government scheme which supports public sector organisations in decarbonising their estate.
