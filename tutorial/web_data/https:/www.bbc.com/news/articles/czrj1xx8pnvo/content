A new scheme has been launched to support those at risk of a disease which one doctor described as "one of our area’s biggest killers". A new programme called Your Healthier Future has been launched by the NHS Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Integrated Care Board (ICB), which aims to help people at risk of developing cardiovascular disease.More than 50 health practices signed up to the scheme to support at risk patients with medication, NHS Health Checks, and weight, fitness and health management. Dr Jessica Randall-Carrick, the clinical co-lead for prevention of the disease, said the disease impacted "communities that face higher deprivation or are from certain ethnic groups".
"We want to help all local people live healthier, longer lives, regardless of where they live or what their background is," Dr Randall-Carrick added."That’s why we’re thrilled to launch Your Healthier Future, to reduce people’s risk of getting cardiovascular disease, whilst supporting those who already have a heart or circulatory illness."The programme also aims to reduce cardiovascular-related deaths in those aged 74 and under. Patients who are high risk, or have a family history of high cholesterol, will be offered NHS health checks as well as treatment to reduce cholesterol levels. People whose medical records suggest they could be at risk will also be contacted directly by their practice at a later stage in the programme. About 128,000 people in the area have already been diagnosed with high blood pressure, which is one of the biggest cardiovascular disease risk factors. The Cambridgeshire and Peterborough ICB said some patients would receive a text from their practice but did not have to respond and could still take part in the programme without sharing all the requested information.The programme was launched using funding for public health from Cambridgeshire County Council and Peterborough City Council.
