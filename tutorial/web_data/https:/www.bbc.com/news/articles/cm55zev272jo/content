A nine-year-old girl has made history by having her own exhibition in London.Art lover Poppy from Fairford, in Gloucestershire, was diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of three.Her work has been on display at Christie's and will be up for auction this month to raise money for Make-A-Wish.She is thought to be the youngest person to display art at the renowned auction house.
Poppy's artwork includes 28 paintings, as well as a chandelier-like display of her "beads of courage".Each bead representing a hospital visit, overnight stay or form of treatment.
The exhibition launched with a celebration from close friends and family last week, then opened to the public. It is believed to be the first exhibition of its kind.Make-A-Wish helps grant the wishes of children who are critically ill. The charity was supported by fundraising initiative Art of Wishes, which brought the art community together to help organise the exhibition.An online auction is being held until 31 May, giving members of the public the opportunity to bid on Poppy's work to raise money for Make-A-Wish.Art collector Batia Ofer supported Poppy's wish and the young Cotswolds artist also spent time with artists Chantal Joffe, Ben Lowe and Hannah Shergold.Instead of being at school, Poppy spent most of her early years in hospital following her diagnosis at the age of three. 
Poppy first started to undergo tests when she was unable to walk during a nursery field trip.Parents Graham and Stephanie said the thought their "healthy and active" toddler may have cancer was "almost impossible to comprehend"."I remember wincing at the sound of it," Stephanie said."It became our whole life, everything we did centred around hospital appointments and unexpected temperatures."
Following treatment, Poppy's passion for art has grown stronger and said she wanted something positive to look forward to.Jason Suckley, chief executive of Make-A-Wish UK, said: "Poppy is an incredible artist and we're proud to be collaborating with Christie's and the prestigious Art of Wishes to grant this once-in-a-lifetime wish."There are more than 63,000 children just like Poppy across the UK dealing with the gruelling daily reality of life with a critical illness, and we believe each and every one of them deserves to wish for more than a life defined by illness."
