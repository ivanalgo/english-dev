A 15-year-old boy who murdered Leeds teenager Alfie Lewis in a knife attack outside a primary school has been detained for life with a minimum term of 13 years.Alfie, also 15, died in hospital after being stabbed in the heart and leg in Church Road, Horsforth, in November 2023.Bardia Shojaeifard, who can now be named after reporting restrictions were lifted, pushed Alfie to the ground before he stabbed him twice "in full view" of a group of school children.Shojaeifard, who was 14 at the time of the killing, was convicted of murder in May following a two-week trial at Leeds Crown Court.
Alfie was attacked near Horsforth School just before 15:00 GMT on 7 November 2023 as he was on his way to meet some friends.Prosecutor Craig Hassall KC said Shojaeifard had walked "purposefully" towards Alfie before stabbing him with a knife he had taken from a kitchen drawer at home.At trial, the teenager had denied murder, claiming to have been "scared" of Alfie following two previous incidents, with the latter of these happening on Halloween.Giving evidence, Shojaeifard said he walked past Alfie's house with a bag of fireworks and Alfie had said to him: "Give me the bag or something worse than last time is going to happen."The defendant said that, when he returned to school after a half-term break, he decided to take a knife from the kitchen drawer to protect himself.
Mr Justice Cotter lifted reporting restrictions preventing Shojaeifard from being identified due to his age on Friday.He said lifting the defendant's anonymity would help in the "vitally important debate about the scourge of knife crime, among young people in particular".During the trial, witnesses including children, school staff and passing members of the public gave evidence, saying they had seen Shojaeifard attack Alfie without provocation.Following the attack Shojaeifard fled the scene but was arrested an hour later by  officers from West Yorkshire Police.A knife recovered near to the scene matched a set found at his home and traces of Alfie's blood were found on the blade.Police said the handle had been painted black, with Shojaeifard thought to have carried the knife with him at school all day, before seeking out Alfie at home time.The court heard Shojaeifard had a "worrying interest in knives" and police found several pictures on his phone of him holding them, including one where a blade had been photoshopped into his hand, and another taken on a family holiday to Iran.
In her victim impact statement, Alfie's mother Heather Lane told the court that she was "absolutely devastated" by the loss of her youngest son.She described Alfie as her "little mate" who never went anywhere without a football."I miss his kisses in the morning, I miss his kisses at night, and all the ones in the middle", she said."I can’t accept what’s happened as the pain is too much. I feel as if I’m in a bubble looking at someone else’s life."She told Shojaeifard she would "never ever forgive" him and no sentence would ever be enough.Passing sentence, Mr Justice Cotter said people would be wondering how a young boy "from a loving and supportive family" could commit such an "extraordinary" crime "without forewarning or any warning signs save for some pictures of knives on his phone".He described Shojaeifard as "outwardly normal" with no interest in crime, however he said he had "carefully planned" his attack on Alfie to "gain revenge for whatever happened on October 31".
He said one witness described the attack as "vicious", with Shojaeifard "trying as much as he could to inflict some sort of damage to Alfie".He added: "Knives have stolen so many lives, and you and others must understand how dangerous this obsession is."Without your interest in knives Alfie would be here today."Alfie’s aunt, Emily Lane, read a statement outside court after the sentencing, surrounded by Alfie’s mother, family and friends.She said: “There is no punishment that can be given that will take away our pain.”Ms Lane also said the family was “devastated” at the sentence handed out, as it did not “demonstrate how serious the actions of Alfie’s murderer have been”.She added: "Alfie, your mum loved you for 15 years and thought she would have you here for the rest of her life.“We love you, we miss you and we will do forever.”Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.
