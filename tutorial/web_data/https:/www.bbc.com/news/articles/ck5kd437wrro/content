The Wild Atlantic Way could be extended to Northern Ireland, Stormont’s Economy Minister Conor Murphy has said. The 2,500 km (1,553 mile) coastal route is a tourism brand which currently stretches from Kinsale, County Cork, to the Inishowen Peninsula, County Donegal, in the Republic of Ireland. The route was launched in 2014 and is credited with helping boost tourism in the west of the country.Mr Murphy has said he wants to start discussions about using the route and other Fáilte Ireland brands in Northern Ireland.
Tourism promotion on the island of Ireland is split between three agencies.Fáilte Ireland promotes the Republic of Ireland, Tourism NI promotes Northern Ireland and Tourism Ireland jointly markets the whole island to international visitors. As a Fáilte Ireland initiative, the Wild Atlantic Way does not currently include Northern Ireland on the route. It is regarded as a highly successful brand with a recent analysis for Fáilte Ireland estimating that it generates revenue of about €3bn (£2.58bn) per year for communities along the route.  Mr Murphy, whose responsibilities as minister include tourism, has said he wants discussions to include consideration of "rolling the wild Atlantic Way into the Causeway Coastal Route, the Hidden Heartlands into Fermanagh, and places such as Downpatrick and Armagh into Ireland’s Ancient East". The possibility of extending the Wild Atlantic Way has been floated before but no serious proposals ever previously emerged.Discussions would need to consider how the move would impact existing tourism branding in Northern Ireland and consider any potential costs.
Colleen McAllister, who runs the Little Shop of Ireland gift shop on the promenade in Portstewart in County Londonderry, said extending the Wild Atlantic Way brand could help promote the area."We have a beautiful coastline but it does need better signage, needs more economic input," she said.“I think we’ve so much on our doorstep, it’s not being used properly and it’s not being promoted properly, both from the point of view of Northern Ireland tourism and our local councils.“I think there’s so much more could be done."
