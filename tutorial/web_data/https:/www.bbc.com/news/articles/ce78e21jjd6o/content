A rower who is about to compete in her first Olympic games said if they get into the final "it's anyone's to play for."Becky Wilde, from Taunton, Somerset, is heading to the Paris Olympics next week to represent Team GB for the first time in the Women's Doubles Skulls.Speaking to the BBC, Ms Wilde said her goal growing up has "always" been the Olympics."It has been since I was six years old and to be here now, it's a dream come true," she said. 
The former Bath University student had been training for the 2018 Commonwealth Games as a swimmer prior to rowing, but said she "fell out of love" with the sport."I'm a firm believer that you must love what you do and I always wanted to try rowing," she said."I was lucky the World Class Start Program was at Bath, which is a talent ID programme, and I messaged the head coach to try it out and it went from there."
Ms Wilde, who is the sculler in the pair, will be rowing with Matilda Hodgkins Byrne.The two women have been working together for only five months."Our relationship is very close," she said. "I feel our boat is our safe space and when we're in it we work so harmoniously."
The former Bath University student thanked those who have offered their support, especially her parents."They've sacrificed a lot for me, for my sports growing up, so having got to this point I am very thankful to them," she added.Ms Wilde and Ms Hodgkins Byrne will not be at the opening ceremony with their race starting the morning after, on 27 July.
