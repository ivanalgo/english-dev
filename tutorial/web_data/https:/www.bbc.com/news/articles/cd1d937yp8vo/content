A pensioner whose wife has dementia said he was able to return to the gym after giving it up to look after her, thanks to a new respite session.A dementia cafe has opened at Fakenham Sports and Fitness Centre in partnership with North Norfolk District Council, aimed at helping people stay active.Gareth Owen, 71, said it was “like walking through treacle” since his wife Ivy had been diagnosed with the condition.“Trying to work out what to do, where you go, and getting the information you need. I’d given up coming to the gym as I had to stay at home to look after her,” he said.
“I come to this gym anyway, and when they said they’re going to start up a thing for dementia, one day a week, I said ‘well that’s an excuse’.“It gives me 45 to 60 minutes when I can actually go back into the gym. There’s enough carers here, it gives me a bit of  gap,” he added.
The dementia cafe offers a range of activities from dominoes and cards to table tennis and seated exercise.General manager Carl Fairbrother said the aim of the cafe was to “reduce the isolation, making them feel part of the community”.“There’s lots going on. It’s also about enjoyment, taking that pressure off and letting people be themselves."He said as well as providing activities for people suffering dementia, the cafe offered respite to carers, allowing them to use the facilities."It's all about taking a bit of time, taking a deep breath. It's so important to keep fit and active, and doing exercise keeps the mind going, keeps it fresh – for any age,” he added.
