A historic sundial in Oakham, which had become barely legible after years of weathering, has been brought back to life.The sundial on the corner of High Street and Market Place has been given a new coat of paint by the town council.Mayor Adam Lowe said the sundial was installed by Charles Matkin in 1874 above a stationers, booksellers and printers, that he ran with his wife Harriet. Oakham Town Council agreed to spend £1,000 on improving the look of two old signs at a meeting in November 2023.
Plans to refurbish another sign, on Catmos Street, were also approved under the plans, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.It is on the side of the building now used as an estate agents.Mr Lowe said: “While the advertising slogan on the upper floor that can be seen in photographs from the 1920s has long since been obliterated, the sundial erected by Matkin remains an eye-catching reminder of the past.“With the completion of the repainting, the sundial can actually tell the people of Oakham the time once again."Follow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
