It is the announcement "paw-litical" pundits have been waiting for.No, not Prime Minister Rishi Sunak finally revealing when the nation will have a general election.We are talking about the inaugural Senedd Dog of the Year competition, and the winner is a cavalier King Charles spaniel called Coco.The three-year-old, who entered the event with Jack Sargeant, Labour Member of the Senedd for Alyn and Deeside, impressed the judges with what they called her loveable character and obvious strong bond with her owner.
Organised by The Kennel Club and Dogs Trust, the canine competition took place for the first time in Britannia Park, Cardiff and focused on promoting responsible dog ownership. Mr Sargeant said: “It’s absolutely fantastic to be crowned Senedd Dog of the Year with the wonderful Coco. "She’s a real companion animal to me, I couldn’t be more proud of her.”The results even showed some political balance in the name of im-paw-tiality.There was also a public online vote won by Bonnie, a cocker spaniel owned by James Evans, the Conservative MS for Brecon and Radnorshire.
