A link up with Antarctica, virtual reality and a member of McFly; just some of the must-see attractions at this year's Royal International Air Tattoo [RIAT].The annual event, at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, attracts more than 150,000 people and hosts more than 250 aircraft.Of course, the world's largest military air show wouldn't be complete without its aerial displays, including the crowd-pleasing Red Arrows.But what else is happening this year?
Pop fans might be excited to hear a member of McFly will be appearing at this year's RIAT.A long-time fan of the event and aviation in general, Tom Fletcher was in the RAF Air Cadets and nearly joined the air force after he left school, but instead formed one of the UK's most successful bands.Tom will be talking about his passions on the Inspire Stage on Saturday morning."Can’t wait!!! It’s genuinely one of the highlights of my year!," he said on Instagram.
Organisers say the show’s Techno Zone and Inspire Stage, which are aimed at a younger audience, are "bigger than ever before".RAF charitable trust's head of charity development, Hannah Langford, said: “We’re really excited to offer an action-packed Inspire Stage schedule across all three days of the show this year."On Sunday, Dr Meganne Christian will speak about her journey from scientist to a reserve astronaut for the European Space Agency [ESA].And on both Saturday and Sunday, members of the Red Arrows will be answering questions, plus you can join a live link with Antarctica and hear from the British Antarctic Survey, while one of their Twin Otter aircraft is on display at the event.
Meanwhile, throughout the show, the Techno Zone, which is bigger than 12 tennis courts, features almost 40 interactive tech exhibits for younger visitors.It includes a cyber and virtual reality hub with Metaverse VR, offering an "out-of-Earth adventure with an AI avatar,"  explained Techno Zone and sponsorship manager Katherine Whinney.She also highlighted MDA Space's lunar landing games and cutting-edge space technology that you can try out.She called the zone a "must-see destination for under-18s when visiting RIAT".
And finally, did you know RAF Fairford becomes "the busiest airport in the world" on the two days the aircraft arrive and disperse from RIAT?Site manager Dan Pigot says: "To stand out on the taxiway and actually watch it is a treat."He explained that's why the organisers open a proportion of the showground for people to watch it take place.If you want to take this in for yourself, head to the area on Wednesday 17 or Monday 22 July.
