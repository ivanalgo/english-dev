The property arm of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) has submitted plans to refurbish a former library.NDA Properties, which manages non-nuclear buildings and assets, wants to create offices at the building on St George's Road in Millom, Cumbria.Plans for a change of use were approved two years ago with a view to creating a hub for up to 100 NDA workers.Now NDA Properties  wants to replace windows and repair the roof and chimneys, claiming the building is in a "poor state".
The library was used as council offices from 1995, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reports.Although not a listed building, most of the property sits within the town's conservation area, documents show.
A planning statement submitted to Cumberland Council said the works were needed to ensure the building was suitable "for future development".The applicant said it understood the building was council-owned, but there had been "little maintenance and investment" in recent years and the building was in a "poor state of repair".It added: "At present, the windows are mostly dilapidated and require replacement for the building to be deemed fit for purpose."The stone and brickwork would also need work, the documents said.The previous application by NDA Properties, approved in 2022, said the building would include office space, meeting rooms and parking for about 22 vehicles.Council officers are currently considering the new application.
