What is thought to be the UK's largest gathering of alpine horn enthusiasts has been staged in Berkshire.Eleven members of the UK Alphorn Network (UKAN) brought their instruments to Downe House School, near Thatcham, on Sunday.Organiser Frances Jones said the sound of the ensemble was "extraordinary".The instrument is traditionally used for herding animals in the Swiss mountains.
Ms Jones, who has been playing and teaching the alphorn for more than 20 years, said the event was an opportunity for UK players to meet and play together."It really is the voice of the mountains. It's a magical sound, so special and unique. It's something you never forget," she said.The instruments - also known as alpine horns - can be up to four metres (13ft) long and are played propped on the groundThey are traditionally made of wood but can also be constructed of carbon fibre.While most can be disassembled for transportation, one had been strapped to the top of a car for the journey to Berkshire.Ms Jones said there were thought to be about 20 alphorn players in the UK, many coming to the instrument having played the French horn or tuba.She is hoping the UKAN PlayDay will become an annual event.
