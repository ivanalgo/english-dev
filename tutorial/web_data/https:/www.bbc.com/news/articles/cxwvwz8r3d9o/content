New scanners are being rolled out at Bristol Airport ahead of the government lifting rules around liquids.Passengers will soon be able walk through security gates without removing liquids and electronics from their bags. Bristol Airport is investing more than £10 million in security equipment, which should be introduced by June.Ministers set a summer deadline for airports to install the technology - but major airports are behind schedule.
London Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester airports are not expected to have the scanners in place in time for 1 June.Bosses at Bristol Airport have said they are "working towards" the June deadline. But, passengers have been urged to check the latest rules before they travel.“Bristol Airport continues to align ourselves with all regulated guidance issued by the Department for Transport to deliver security requirements and welcome the introduction of new technology which will further improve the airport customer experience in the future from June 2024 onwards," a spokesperson said. "We are investing over £10m in security equipment enhancements, as with all complex and large-scale projects we are aware of some supply chain challenges, and we are continuing to work to the June 2024 deadline.  "However, customers should be reminded there are no immediate changes to the rules governing what can be taken through security as a result of this initiative, and the current hand luggage restrictions remain in place.”Airports had to apply individually for extensions of the June deadline, which means passengers should check each individual airport's rules before travelling. The rule which meant all liquid over 100ml had to scanned separately was introduced in 2006 as “a temporary measure” after a terrorist plot was uncovered.Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.
