A six-year-old boy who helped save his mum after she had a severe asthma attack has been recognised for his bravery.Rhiannon Clark, who has brittle asthma, was at home last month when she became unwell.Her son Dimitri, a pupil at St Peter's Primary School in Coggeshall, Essex, dialled 999 and managed to direct an ambulance to their home - despite having a speech impediment.He was awarded a certificate by the East of England Ambulance Service during an assembly for his quick-thinking.
“I have a lot of attacks, but this was the first time that I had one when my husband was not there," Mrs Clark said.“I lost the ability to speak, but Dimitri made the call for me."
When asked what service he needed, Dimitri requested an ambulance and said: "My mum’s not breathing, you need to come right away".A crew arrived within five minutes and began treating Mrs Clark.“I’m very proud of Dimitri as he has a speech impediment and doesn’t really know how to talk to people on the phone yet," she said"It was quite a challenge for him to talk to strangers and give them information.”
Dimitri was handed his certificate by the ambulance service's chief executive, Tom Abell.Mr Abell said he was "amazed" by how calmly the youngster acted."It would have been a frightening experience for anyone, but for someone unused to talking on the phone that must have been even more difficult," he said.“Dimitri showed real courage and gave us the information we needed to get help to his mum.”
