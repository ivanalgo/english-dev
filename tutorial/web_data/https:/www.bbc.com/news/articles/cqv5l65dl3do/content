A charity attempting to buy a former Girlguiding outdoor pursuit centre said it was "devastated" after being turned down as the preferred bidder.Foxies Future raised £4m to save Foxlease in Lyndhurst, Hampshire, after Girl Guiding confirmed in 2023 it planed to sell the activity centre.The charity was told it was not the preferred bidder but has pledged to continue its efforts.Girlguiding UK said it was working to achieve the "best value and outcomes" for its members.
The organisation announced in August last year it would close its five activity centres to ensure it was "financially sustainable".Local guide leaders and supporters set up Foxie's Future to raise money to buy Foxlease - a Georgian house with 64 acres (26 hectares) of grounds in the New Forest National Park.The site had been used an outdoor activities centre for young people for more than 100 years.Foxie's Future said it had a "sound five-year business plan" to run the venue.Chair Hazel Warwick said the charity had submitted "an unconditional bid above the guide price", but she had been informed that it had not been chosen as the preferred bidder, and not informed about the bid that had been accepted."It was absolutely devastating," she said."We have so many supporters across the world who have got us to this place - raising £4m in less than 12 months.""We don't know the reasons as to why we haven't been selected."Ms Warwick insisted "nothing is finalised" until contracts are exchanged and called for Girlguiding UK to reverse its decision."We're asking everyone - the local community, people who have used the site, our fundraisers to write to the trustees at Girlguiding headquarters in London to set out why they are disappointed in the decision," she said.She called for dialogue and also said she would be prepared to talk to the preferred bidder to explore "partnership opportunities".In a statement, Girlguiding UK said the information on the sale was "commercially confidential"."We are working hard and with care to ensure we achieve the best value and outcomes for Girlguiding members across the UK," it said."Throughout this process we have been acting for the overall welfare of the organisation and in accordance with charity law."
