A Grade II-listed Derbyshire castle has been given a new lease of life by being transformed into flats.Riber Castle, which is located in the Derbyshire Dales and overlooks Matlock, was originally constructed as the private residence of industrialist and philanthropist John Smedley in 1862.The building, which also once served as a school, has gone through an "extensive renovation" since it was purchased in 2000 and is now home to 26 apartments.Residents have access to an on-site wellness spa, gym, listed courtyard garden and an orangery.
Riber Castle was left unoccupied after closing as a boarding school in 1930 and was used as an emergency food store during World War Two.A zoo also operated within the grounds until it closed at the turn of the century.In 2000, with the ruins of Riber Castle comprising just four outer walls and no roof, The Wright Family acquired the property to "restore it to its former glory".On selling the property, Jamie Adam, director at Savills estate agents, said: â€œWithout question, this is one of the rarest developments I have been instructed on during my career. "Not only does it have the most outstanding views in the heart of the Derbyshire Dales, but Riber Castle also combines historic grandeur with modern luxury and that is testament to the vision of the Wright family and the painstaking and loving restoration they have achieved."Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
