Cornwall Council has promised to fully engage with local businesses in future about a deal to bring in a commercial partner for Cornwall Airport Newquay.The county's Chamber of Commerce raised concerns it had not been properly consulted and the authority's chosen company did not have experience running airports.The council, which owns the airport, said it would meet with business leaders soon - and any deal would ensure the airport continued to grow and keep regular routes to other UK cities.It also stressed "specialist management" provided by Cornwall Airport Limited, which it also owns, would also remain in place to run the airport on behalf of the authority.
Cornwall Council currently owns and operates the airport and wider estate - including the Aerohub Business Park, Spaceport, Kernow Solar Park, and 200 acres of undeveloped land.However, despite bringing £72m into the Cornish economy every year, the council currently subsidises the airport by about £4m annually.The authority council said it had decided to bring in a commercial partner following a strategic review of its options.Opposition councillors have criticised the lack of wider consultation over the airport's future.However, the council insisted it would provide businesses with information to understand the deal, its benefits - and would "reflect on any comments" it receives.An agreement for the site is being worked on over the summer, with a final decision due to be made by the Conservative-run council's cabinet in the  autumn.
