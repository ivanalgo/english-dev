Pupils at a special educational school are appealing for better road safety measures outside their place of study.Road markings outside Clifton Hill School, in Chaldon Road, Caterham, have faded and the only ‘School Ahead’ sign post is partially obscured by trees. The school, which caters for students aged 11-19 with severe and complex learning difficulties and special needs, wants a zebra crossing to be installed, as well as better road signage and markings.Students and teachers met with Tandridge District councillors and East Surrey MP Claire Coutinho where they said they felt “unsafe” crossing the road to school.
A pupil who uses a wheelchair said there are no ramps or dropped curbs to allow proper access so he has to use the car entrance to get on the pavement.The teenager added it is “scary” and he does not feel safe crossing the road on his own.Another student said some motorists drive like “maniacs” on the road outside the school grounds.
Staff have bought a lollipop sign at their own expense for around £100 to help students safely cross, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.Ms Coutinho said: “Every family should feel safe dropping their children to school, especially those who have severe and complex needs.“Road safety is the responsibility of Surrey County Council and any improvements do take time to put in place.”A spokesperson for Surrey County Council said: “We have a number of schools that have requested an assessment and unfortunately we have to undertake these during school term times to get an accurate picture of road user behaviour in the vicinity of the school.“The earliest we can complete this assessment, alongside police colleagues and the local member and representatives of the school, is early in the new academic year.”
