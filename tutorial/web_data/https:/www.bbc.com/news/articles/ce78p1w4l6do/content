An animal welfare charity says it thinks a dog is struggling to get adopted because of his sad face.Three-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier cross Draygo was rescued by the RSPCA Great Ayton Animal Centre in Middlesbrough in March, following welfare concerns.Draygo was "malnourished, skinny and shutdown" when he was rescued, but has since "blossomed", the team said.Kennel supervisor Rebecca Cooper said: "He's such a lovely lad with so much love to give but he has got a rather glum expression, which may be putting potential adopters off."
Draygo was "severely emaciated" and has been nursed back to health by the team at the RSPCA.Animal care assistant Lizze Burbidge said: "He's had the saddest face since he came in, it's just who he is, he has that look about him."But he's not really sad, he's happy."
Ms Burbidge said Draygo enjoyed playing with tennis balls and cuddles."He's a bundle of joy," she said, adding: "But we feel like his face has put people off a bit - with his sad, little puppy dog eyes."Draygo was rehomed briefly last month but due to separation-related behaviour he was returned to the animal centre.Ms Cooper said he could be anxious and needed a new owner who would be around most of the time and take the time to build up a bond with him.She said anyone interested in adopting Draygo needed to fill in an online form.
