A Guinness World Record-holder, who inspired a group of women to climb the highest peak in North Africa, has said she was "buzzing" when the party of four reached the summit.Zaynab Jogi, from Blackburn, Lancashire, said she had pushed the climbing party "to the core" to prepare them for the women-only trek to ascend Mount Toubkal in Morocco.Miss Jogi, known as Zee, said the climb had been organised "to empower women" and was marked by "incredible determination and resilience".Training to reach the 13,671ft (4,167m) high peak included climbing Ben Nevis in Scotland, the UK's highest mountain.
Training also saw the women scale Scafell Pike in Cumbria and Yr Wyddfa, also known as Mount Snowdon, in Wales, before heading overseas and tackling Mount Toubkal in the Atlas Mountains.After just two hours of sleep, the group of women began the climb to the summit in the dark at the end of June.Two of the six women had to turn back during the "intense and challenging experience", but the four remaining women pushed through fatigue, heat and altitude sickness to reach the summit.The trek raised funds for Z's Defence Academy, which Miss Jogi set up six years ago. The charity offers a range of classes, from courses in well-being and nutrition, to self-defence.Miss Jogi had previously climbed to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro in 2021 where she took part in two Guinness World Records - the highest-ever obstacle course and fitness class.
