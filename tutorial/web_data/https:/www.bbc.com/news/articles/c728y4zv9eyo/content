A number of suspicious pigeon deaths are being investigated by the RSPCA. The charity said all the deceased birds were reported by a member of public in Eastern Esplandade, Southend-on-Sea.It said the dead birds, along with and one rescued pigeon, were taken to the South Essex Wildlife Hospital, where vets discovered it had been shot with an air gun. Enola Evans, animal rescue officer for the RSPCA, said it was "very distressing to think that people may be taking pleasure in causing such horrific injuries to defenceless animals".
The charity said the cause of death for the birds could not be established "as they were too decomposed".Ms Evans said: "It is concerning to hear that a number of birds have been found dead - and while we donâ€™t know the cause of all the deaths - it is suspicious considering they were found in the same area and there was a number of them."All wild birds are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and it is illegal - except under licence - to take, injure or kill wild birds, the RSPCA said."We want to see a world where every kind of animal is treated with compassion and respect and deliberate and brutal acts of cruelty should be consigned to the past," Ms Evan said.
