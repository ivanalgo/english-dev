Health services on the Isle of Man have been affected by the current global IT issues, with one surgery's "entire system" down and patients warned to be braced for delays.Manx Care said the problems were being experienced by GP surgeries across the island.It said its primary care services had “reverted to business continuity plans”.However, it warned “patients may experience delays across Manx Care services until systems are restored”.
Among those affected, Ramsey Group Practice said its “entire clinical system” was down.Kensington Group Practice, in Douglas, confirmed doctors and nurses were still seeing those already booked but warned they may not be able to see some patient notes and no new appointments could be booked.Posting on Facebook, the Palatine Group Practice in Braddan said it was “working to resolve” issues and  asked patients to “please be kind to staff” as they were “doing what they can”.“If your call isn’t urgent please try a bit later,” it added.Manx Care said anyone who had not received a planned visit from a district nurse, health visitor or school nurse on Friday should contact the health care provider.
Those experiencing difficulties getting a repeat prescription from a community pharmacy should contact their regular outlet, who could help with an “emergency supply or loan” as long strict conditions were met.Any emergency supplies could only be given for regular medication, would be a short course of five days and would be taken out of the patient’s next prescription, the provider said.The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company also confirmed its onboard retail services had been hit by problems.It said it was currently unable to process card payments on sailings of both the Manxman and the Manannan and only cash purchases could be made.The Isle of Man Airport said while its systems were not experiencing issues, there could be delays to flights in and out of the facility could be a knock-on effect of disruption elsewhere.
