A 14-year-old boy plans to cycle 335 miles (540km) to Amsterdam to raise money in memory of his best friend who died from cancer.Layton, from Retford, wanted to raise money for Sheffield Children's Hospital Charity, which helped care for his friend Daisy.The ride, from London to the capital of the Netherlands, begins on Wednesday and will take four days, passing through four countries."Every time I go on the bike, I just think about how tough she was and the hard moments she had," he said.
Layton said Daisy was his "best friend" and he was told she had cancer while she was in primary school in 2021."I just couldn't believe it when she was diagnosed," he said.Daisy's tumour spread from her kidney and despite recovering from the cancer three times, she died just before Christmas in 2023."It was horrible. I told her that I'd always be there for her. She was a fighter," Layton said.Daisy was cared for at Sheffield Children's Hospital, with Layton constantly raising money to help support the charity.His latest challenge, in the form of the huge bike ride, would be carried out in her honour, he said.
However, Layton said being the only child taking on the challenge on Wednesday meant he needed an adult to accompany him, leading to his mum also training for the ride."I had to drag one of my parents into it, and I couldn't see my dad doing it, so I had to ask my mum. She had no choice," he said.Layton added that he looked forward to being on the bike and completing the challenge in memory of his best friend."Daisy always a had a smile on her face, always happy, never showed anything but happiness," he said.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
