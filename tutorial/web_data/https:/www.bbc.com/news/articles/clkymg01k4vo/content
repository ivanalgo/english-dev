A Grade II-listed church gate which gets its name from the Old English word for corpse is undergoing a full restoration.The Lych Gate was gifted to Chorlton, Manchester, by politician and barrister, Sir William Cunliffe Brooks, 1st Baronet, to mark Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee.Dating back to 1887, the structure and cemetery are all that remain of the former St Clement's Church, which was demolished in 1949 after falling into a state of disrepair.Local historian, Andrew Simpson said the gate was "an iconic image of Chorlton" and "maintains our link with the past".
Lychgates were so named as they provided shelter for the coffin bearers while they awaited the arrival of the clergyman to conduct a burial.Work now underway includes replacing the timber, overhauling the roof, cleaning the brickwork and repointing, along with repairs to the path and infill panels.Manchester City Council's deputy leader Garry Bridges said: "Monuments like the Lych Gate are important reminders of the rich and varied history of Manchester and... are more than worthwhile preserving."He said he was pleased that it would be fully restored over the coming months, "serving as a focal point for the community for years to come".A diversion for pedestrians is in place while the work is carried out, a council spokesperson said.
