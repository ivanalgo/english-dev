Free tennis sessions are being offered in Epsom & Ewell, continuing the enthusiasm for the game after Wimbledon, the borough council has said.Court bookings and coaching opportunities are available to enable people of all ages, experience and backgrounds to join in, Councillor Liz Frost said."The decision to extend free, bookable morning sessions at our tennis courts during the summer holidays gives residents, particularly our younger ones, a greater opportunity to keep active and have fun," she said.The chairwoman of the environment committee added: "We hope that this will encourage those who have otherwise not considered playing tennis the incentive to give it a go."
She said it was hoped if people enjoyed the tennis sessions, they would then join as members in the future.The council said anyone wishing to take up the free offer only needed to create a free ClubSpark account and choose a court and one of the free slots to make a booking.
