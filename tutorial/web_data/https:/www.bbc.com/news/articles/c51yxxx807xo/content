The fishing industry in a seaside town known around the world for its crustaceans has put a drop in demand for crabs down to the poor summer.Crabs from Cromer, in Norfolk, have long featured on the menus at high-end restaurants, and tourists head to the town to sample the local delicacy.But one specialist supplier - Jonas Seafoods - has had to reduce the amount of crab it takes in, blaming a double whammy of the bad weather combined with the rise in the cost of living."It hasn't been crab salad weather," said John Davies, a fisherman and fishmonger.
"The economy is struggling, we are luxury food item, and the cost of living has a knock-on effect, so prices are going up everywhere," he added. "There's just not been the volume of people about." Mr Davies said: "With the wind coming off the sea when itâ€™s cold, do you want to go and have a nice crab salad or do you want to be in a pub having a stew?"I know which one I'd rather do when the weather is not very nice."
Jonas Seafood takes between 400 and 500 tonnes of crab from local fishermen each year, but it has reduced its intake.Kevin Jonas, the managing director, said he had "not seen this before"."I have been in this business for the best part of 30 years. "This is not a decision I take lightly, but we have to make security of the business our priority," Mr Jonas said."I think this is due to the weather and there is less money around."
