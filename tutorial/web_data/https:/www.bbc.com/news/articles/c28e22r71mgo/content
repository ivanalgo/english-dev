A secondary school is planning to build temporary classrooms so it can take on more than 100 extra students.Foxford School and Community Arts College in Coventry, which already has 975 pupils, will see numbers rise by more than10 per cent. Plans have been put forward by the council to put two units in an existing car park. Documents state that the move is driven by the need to find room for 120 extra pupils who will join the school in September. 
Four temporary classrooms with toilets will be built on the tarmac car park by Ansell Drive, a planning statement said.The new structure could be in place for four years and parking spaces will be added to a different staff car park to make up for the lost bays. Four extra teachers and two teaching assistants are set to be hired by the school, the report added.The plans include new double gates and a dropped kerb, so deliveries and emergency vehicles can still get through to the school, and adjusting a fence to include the new classrooms.The school, along with others in the city, agreed to temporarily expand this year to help meet expected high demand for places, said a statement on the council's website. It added: “It was not possible to offer places to all who requested places at over-subscribed schools. All places were allocated using the criteria in each school admissions policy.”
