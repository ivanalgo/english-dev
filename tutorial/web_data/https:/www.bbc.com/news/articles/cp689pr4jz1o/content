"They're just over the moon, it is such a good opportunity, not only is it financial support for us but a great opportunity to get some awareness about our support," Mrs Harris told the programme.The charity said demand for its services was increasing across Dublin and Ireland.Ms Harris said: "We just really want to use this opportunity to reach as many people as we possibly can.""We aim to help any family or individual who is experiencing food insecurity. That can come in a number of guises it could be that somebody has had a bad circumstance, they may have got ill, had to stop work and this has had a huge impact on their food and ability to buy their own food, so we work with that person and try to support them with a food hamper but also try to address the issues that are causing them not to be able to buy their own shopping," she added.
Food banks in Liverpool and Cardiff have also announced "substantial" donations in the wake of her concerts there, with one saying her gift would fund food donations for the next 12 months.
