A company has donated thousands of pounds to provide yearly assistance for those who have been through breast surgery. Such patients usually get one special bra to wear during their recovery. They are designed to accommodate post-operative drain but it can mean wearers are forced to stay at home when the items are being washed. After workers at Goodyear donated £6,340, about 450 people will now get a second bra each year - a donation that The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust said would take away the often daunting process of buying underwear after surgery.
Samantha Bullows, lead breast cancer nurse, said the Trust could now ensure patients who needed them had two comfy specialist bras to potentially reduce pain and complications.“It is great to be able to supply two bras and on behalf of our patients we are very grateful," she said. Siobhan Lynch, from Albrighton, Shropshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer last July after finding a lump and underwent a mastectomy. "I had to have three drains in for a week and a half following my surgery and the bras even had space to facilitate these," she said. "They are great and I am really glad all women will now be provided with two."Cyril Barrett, chair of the 5/344 Transport and General Workers Union Benevolent Fund, said the donation was the latest in a long line. "We have been supporting breast care services at New Cross since the late 80s and are very proud to do so," he said.
