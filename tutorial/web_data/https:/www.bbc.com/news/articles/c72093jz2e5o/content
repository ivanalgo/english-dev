A replacement bridge for one near Chatsworth House washed away by a storm is about to be opened up to the public.During Storm Babet in October, high water pulled in debris from the usually dry riverbanks which collected at the 30ft (9.2m) Heathy Lea footbridge over the Heathy Lea Brook, near Baslow.The weight of the collected flotsam dislodged the bridge, which has been out of action since.Now, 28 Peak Park Conservation Volunteers plus leaders have almost finished construction of a new higher bridge with a new design to accommodate future storms.
Matty Greenan, 37, volunteer and community ranger for Peak District National Park, said: “Heathy Lea bridge is on Chatsworth Estate land and it is an access straight into Chatsworth.“It’s quite an important route, lots of people use this route and it’s been a bit of a diversion for people.“The bridge there got built in 2008 after the old one was washed away, but this got washed away in October.“The bridge completely washed down stream and caused quite a bit of damage."
The new £4,000 footbridge is made up of railway sleepers attached to stone stanchions which weigh 20 tonnes, all of which can be replaced individually if damaged.A new cable handrail is attached to the banks rather than the bridge.
Mr Greenan said: “Now we can replace each individual bit. We’re thinking for the future.“Obviously with the climate changing and the higher waters, we’re thinking ahead about how we can make it safer.”The crossing will be back open to the public after works complete on 24 July.A Peak District National Park spokesperson said: "The bridge at Heathy Lea near Baslow was sadly washed away in a storm last October."Our Peak Park Conservation Volunteers were asked if they could repair the damage."They're almost done and soon we'll have a brand new bridge for everyone to enjoy."Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
