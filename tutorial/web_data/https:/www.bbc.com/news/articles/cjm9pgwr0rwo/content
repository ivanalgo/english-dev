A railway company announced it had begun offering 'Baby on Board' badges to expectant parents.East Midlands Railway (EMR) said it hoped the move would provide women with added comfort and confidence while travelling.The firm added that the idea was suggested by train staff.The badges have been welcomed by a rail campaign group which covers Lincolnshire, North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire.
They are intended to be a quick way to signal a passenger's condition and encourage other travellers to feel more comfortable offering their seat.Philippa Creswell, customer service director at EMR, commented: "We want pregnant customers to feel as comfortable as possible when travelling with us. "But we understand that offering a seat to someone who may be pregnant can sometimes feel awkward or uncertain. "The 'Baby on Board' badge provides a clear, respectful signal, helping to eliminate any discomfort and promote kindness and consideration among customers."
David Harby, from campaign group Railfuture, described the badges as a "very good idea," although he added they were "a bit late in the day"."We've been pressing for better facilities for pregnant women but also better facilities for all parents with young children. "Sadly, a lot of the facilities on the trains are nowhere near up to the standard parents come to expect nowadays."Mr Harby said badges would help to identify passengers in more need of a seat. "It's never going to cure problems but it will, at least, make them obvious and it will also make them obvious to the train crew on board, as well, and the railway staff on the platforms."
Pregnant women interested in receiving a Baby on Board badge can contact the EMR customer service centre.James Coxon from EMR, said some people had already been in touch in the first week of the new scheme.He said the policy would be reviewed "after a few months".Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
