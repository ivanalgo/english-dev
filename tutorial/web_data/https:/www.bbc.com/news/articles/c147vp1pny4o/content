A brewery has been given permission to take over a former pub and spend £1m to turn it into a museum with function rooms.Joules Brewery, in Market Drayton, operates in Great Hales Street and the 19th Century Stags Head stands next door.The company plans to run brewery tours from the rooms and build a two storey extension.The Drayton Civic Society, which runs the museum and resource centre on Shropshire Street, described the development as a “wonderful opportunity”.
Joules said 11 jobs would be created and the building's museum and resource centre would be housed on the first floor of the building.The company said the move demonstrates its “total and unequivocal” commitment to brewing in the area.A report considered by Shropshire Council planners said the building has "been vacant for some time and is in need of renovation".It also said the proposed development would "provide improved facilities and provide a social venue for the town and provide opportunities for private functions".The civic society said it would seek funding to fit out the museum space.
