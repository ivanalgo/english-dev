Thousands of music fans attended Cleethorpes’ first ever DocksFest music festival on Saturday.Rock and Indie bands Razorlight, Feeder and The Lottery Winners headlined the event, hosted by Grimsby actor and comedian Lloyd Griffith.Frank Turner also joined local bands Healer and Orphan Boy at the Meridian Showground.The team behind the festival, Docks Beers and Docks Academy, said they hoped the event would become an annual fixture on the calendar for North East Lincolnshire.
Event director Will Douglas said it had been four years since the idea was first considered, and 14 months of hard work had gone into staging it.“It’s a destination event”, he said. “We’ve had people who have come from all over the country, from Liverpool, from Devon and from Scotland, so it’s fantastic to see this location being on the map for the rest of the UK for live music.”
In the crowd Will Henry, 31, from Grimsby said: “Its been incredible to see bands like this in Cleethorpes, it’s the best night of my life.”Heidi McNally agreed: “We don’t normally have big events like this so we’ve looked forward to it for months.”
Event host Lloyd Griffith said he hadn’t seen anything like it in Cleethorpes since the Radio One roadshow in 1999.“It's brilliant! I’ve been walking around and everyone is so excited, and so happy that these bands have come to the area, that it’s on their doorstep and they haven’t had to travel to Doncaster or Sheffield – it’s here!”Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
