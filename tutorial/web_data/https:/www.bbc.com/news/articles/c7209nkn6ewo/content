Lidl has said it wants to demolish a former hotel “as early as possible” to make way for a new store.The supermarket chain said there was a strong desire for the Three Counties Hotel in Hereford to be knocked down quickly, partly “to limit potential for criminal activity”.Planning permission for the new store was granted in March.But Lidl has requested conditions be amended to allow demolition to begin later this year.
As things stand, permission involves the contractor that would build the store also carrying out the demolition component of the project.Under the conditions, the demolition cannot begin until that contractor is appointed - a selection that will not be completed, Lidl says, until next year.Lidl wants to expedite progress by separating parties and having demolition carried out independently, seeking council permission for the proposal.The site was the scene of a break-in and occupation in June, with bailiffs removing those involved."Partly in response to limit the potential for criminal activity at the site, there is a strong desire to carry out the demolition activity as early as possible (late 2024), before the general contractor has been chosen and appointed,” Lidl stated in a letter to Herefordshire Council's planning office.
The hotel, which was built in the 1980s, closed to guests in  March last year, although served as accommodation for asylum seekers for some months afterwards.A legal challenge opposing the approval of the store was made by an anonymous group of residents in April.Herefordshire Council has been asked about the outcome of that process.
