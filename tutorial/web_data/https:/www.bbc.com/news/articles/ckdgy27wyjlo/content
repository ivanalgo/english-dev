The mother of British teenager Jay Slater says the family's "hearts are broken" after a body found in Tenerife was confirmed as her son.Debbie Duncan said in statement that her son's death was the "worst news", adding: "I just can’t believe this could happen to my beautiful boy."Officials say the 19-year-old's death is a result of "trauma consistent with a fall in a rocky area", adding that fingerprint tests showed the body found in Masca on Monday was Mr Slater.Earlier, charity LBT Global had confirmed that Mr Slater's possessions were also discovered near his last known location. The teenager, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, was last seen on 17 June, after visiting an Airbnb rented by two people he had been with at the NRG music festival on the island.

Earlier, the High Court of Justice of the Canary Islands said: "We have a positive identification and more data: fingerprint tests show that the body is [that] of Jay Slater and that the death was caused by trauma consistent with a fall in a rocky area."LBT Global’s Matthew Searle was with Mr Slater’s mother when they heard the news that the body had been identified as her son and said the family were devastated.He said: "The announcement does seem to confirm that Jay died of injuries consistent with an accidental fall from a considerable height."Mr Searle said the charity, which helps families in missing persons cases overseas, would be supporting the family "to make this horrific time as easy as possible".He added: "We are working with the family now to sort out the next steps of taking Jay home, recovery of his belongings and laying him to rest."
An earlier court statement today said that documentation found with the body belonged to the apprentice bricklayer."It is confirmed that the documentation that was on the body found yesterday in the mountains of Masca belongs to Jay Slater," it said.It went on to add that "everything suggests that it was an accidental fall" but the results of the official investigation into the death would take more time.Mr Slater's body was discovered by members of a mountain rescue team from the Spanish Civil Guard, near the village of Masca, on Monday. 
Just two weeks ago, the civil guard on the island said the search had been called off, though the investigation remained open.It is now clear that, in fact, the force was continuing with searches during this time.Hinting at a possible reason, police said they made efforts to "preserve the natural space to ensure it did not fill up with curious onlookers".That appeared to be a reference to the huge interest the case generated in the UK, particularly on social media, where bizarre conspiracy theories were circulating and which even led to some online sleuths travelling to Tenerife to join in the search.In contrast to the UK, where officers will often give briefings during investigations, the Spanish police give very little information to the media while cases like this are open. They did, however, say that nothing had been ruled out.It is possible that this approach allowed the information vacuum to be filled by "curious onlookers". Announcing the halting of the search yet continuing it in a low-key, virtually secret, way allowed the online noise - and media attention - to subside.Nonetheless, the police do appear keen to demonstrate how demanding the search has been and why it has taken so long.Video released by the civil guard showed just how difficult it was to access the steep rocky area where the body was discovered.
Earlier, a friend of Jay Slater paid tribute to "the happiest and most smiley person in the room".Lucy Law, who was the last known person to speak to Mr Slater during a phone call on 17 June, paid tribute to him on her Instagram page.She said: "Honestly lost for words. Always the happiest and most smiley person in the room, you was (sic) one of a kind Jay and you'll be missed more than you know."Ms Law's tribute continued: "I'm sure you'll 'have your dancing shoes polished and ready' waiting for us all."We all love you buddy. Fly high."Accrington and Rossendale College, where Mr Slater was studying as an apprentice bricklayer, said it was "deeply saddened" to hear the news of his death.It added, Mr Slater was a "hard-working apprentice" at the college "with a very bright future ahead of him"."Our thoughts and condolences go out to his family, friends, and all who knew and loved him."The head teachers of the primary and high school Mr Slater attended in Oswaldtwistle have issued a joint tribute to him.Andrew Williams, head teacher of Rhyddings High School, and James McBride, head teacher of West End Primary School, said: "All members of our school communities, both past and present, share in our condolences and deepest sympathies for those who knew Jay."As a devoted mother, we know Debbie would have never given up looking for Jay, and she and the family are firmly in our thoughts and prayers at this difficult time."
About 100 people attended a vigil in memory of Mr Slater at West End Methodist Church in Oswaldtwistle earlier, where they released balloons.Friend Holly Kidd said she "always hoped he would be alright"."I used to go out with him round town. He was such a lovely lad, it's really upsetting. Just a really good friend. I just want him to know that we all miss him and we always will," she said.Carly Armstrong, whose son was friends with the teenager, said: "It's been heartbreaking. They grew up together."If I could have gone over and searched the mountains myself I would have. It could have been any of them really, it's just devastating."I want to show Jay's mum that we all love her, are thinking of her and are all here."Pam Kerann  who coached Mr Slater at football when he was younger, said: "It's nice for the community to come together and remember Jay. "Everyone's got their own memories of him. He's a mop-haired little footballer to me."
