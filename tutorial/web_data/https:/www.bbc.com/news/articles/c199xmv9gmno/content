The family of a teenager who died after raising £250,000 for the NHS has thanked the street art community for keeping his project alive.Noah, who lived in Dedham, Essex, collaborated with over 750 artists worldwide, before he died aged 15 in November.His dad Nathan said people were now putting stickers of his son's "beautiful, fun-loving, smiley face" around the world."It’s heartwarming to see on a daily basis and we are excited to see where he pops up next," he said.
"I’d also like to say a big thank you for all the love and support shown to our family during these tough times."Noah, who had hydrocephalus, epilepsy and cerebral palsy, went by the nickname Background Bob.He started painting on cardboard to pass the time during the first Covid-19 lockdown while he could not attend school.
Mr Jones posted on Instagram asking people to collaborate with his son and street artists came forward from around the world.The idea was so popular that the art was exhibited several times and the family published several books.Hundreds of pieces were auctioned for the Colchester and Ipswich Hospitals Charity - in aid of the hospital trust which treated him - across three different projects.
Noah's face has so far popped up on stickers, which were produced as part of the project and given away for free, in Buckingham Palace, at football stadiums and gigs and on monuments across the world."Noah left a big hole in our family and the community that we built wanted to spread his smiley face across the world."It's a really lovely thing for us as parents who miss our child deeply to see his face pop up in all these remarkable places and places that his condition stopped him going to in a real life."This a joyous way of continuing his legacy," he added.
The family now plans to travel and see how many stickers they can spot in real life.Bob’s travels can be followed on Instagram @background_bob or following the hashtags #bemorebob and #everywherewegoyougo.
