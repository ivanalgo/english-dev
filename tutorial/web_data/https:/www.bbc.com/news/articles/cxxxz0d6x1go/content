A deal has been reached between Braddan Commissioners and the Department of Health and Social Care for land to build an access road to a new community leisure centre.The local authority has submitted an application to the Department of Infrastructure to sign off on the deal for Â£250 for access to the Roundhouse.The agreement would also also see the government take ownership of parcels of land around Noble's Hospital that are currently owned by the local authority.Chairman Andrew Jessopp said the board was happy that "the completion of the process is finally in sight" after "several years of patiently waiting".
Mr Jessopp said the local authority was "relieved" that the parcel of land to enable the creation of an alternative access to the Roundhouse was "included in the planned transactions".Access to the building had been disputed between the commissioners, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and Manx Care, with the government refusing to grant access to the community centre through hospital grounds.In addition, the DHSC and the commissioners have agreed to exchange land that was found to have been incorrectly plotted around Palatine Health Centre.A further anomaly has been found where part of the local authority's new car park has been constructed on land owned by the DHSC.Both of these matters are set to be resolved in the new agreement to purchase the land for the entrance to the Roundhouse via Ballaoates Road.Mr Jessopp said while the commissioners "would have been happier if this process had been completed sooner", the board "understand time and resources are limited" with the Attorney General's chambers."Given the recent announcement that government is looking for ways to make efficiency savings, we doubt the situation is likely to improve any time soon," he added.The petition for the land will be considered by the Department of Infrastructure before a final decision is taken.
