Residents living on a street in Oldbury close to the M5 say a decision to throw out plans for new housing is a win for wildlife.Land off Titford Road, considered a wildlife corridor, had been earmarked for 60 new homes.However Sandwell Councilâ€™s planning committee rejected the application, citing fears of pollution linked to cancer stemming from busier roads.  Local campaigner Phil Shakespeare said common sense had "prevailed".
"The residents of Titford Road and more importantly the animals of the wildlife corridor have finally been considered and respected," he said.Fellow local resident Amanda Newton said: "The council has seen sense and put residents, their health and wellbeing and our green wildlife corridor before money."I feel so emotional that [residents] are not going to have the hell and disruption this would have caused."
The area has long been eyed-up by developers, with neighbours saying it had been being targeted for the second time in four years. It is also earmarked for development on the council's draft local plan.Campaigners argued the latest proposals would destroy much of the green space behind their homes, which also blocks noise from the M5 motorway. The land is home to badgers, foxes and many species of birds.
A decision to refuse the application by developer Countryside was made on grounds of pollution, due to busier roads.Fine particles classified as PM2.5 have been linked to cancer, heart disease, asthma and low birth weight.Countryside previously said it recognised the importance of protecting wildlife and the scheme would help bridge a housing shortage in the area. The developer has been contacted for a response to the council decision.
