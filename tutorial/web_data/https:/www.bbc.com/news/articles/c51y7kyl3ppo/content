A "one-of-a-kind" supercar, which was restored in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, is to be returned to its owner in the United States of America.The Aston Martin Bulldog spent more than four-and-a-half years in the county, being restored over the course of 7,000 hours, by Classic Motor Cars (CMC).It will now be shipped to California for the Pebble Beach Concours, a prestigious car show.Tim Griffin, managing director of CMC, said the company was "proud and privileged" to have worked on the car.
The Bulldog was produced in 1979 by Aston Martin, and was the only one of its kind ever made.It became the fastest car on the road when it reached a record-breaking 192mph (308km/h).But it failed to reach the 200mph (321.8km/h) goal set for it.It was later sold off by the company and became a rarely-seen "automotive myth".
The Bulldog was then acquired by its current owner, American businessman and car collector Phillip Sarofim.CMC was chosen to undertake its restoration, and it arrived in Bridgnorth in early 2020, where it underwent a nuts and bolts makeover.The car reached a speed of 162mph (260.7km/h) in November 2021 at the Yeovilton Navy base, Somerset.Then, in June 2023, it smashed the original goal, reaching 205.4mph (330.5km/h) in Campbeltown, Scotland, driven by Aston Martin works driver, Darren Turner.
At the US competition, it will be judged in the wedge-shaped concept car and prototype class."Concept car designers  prove that itâ€™s not necessary to accept the past in order to look to the future," said Mr Sarofim. "I am a great believer in the power of icons such as Bulldog to inspire the next generation to push the boundaries and shoot for the stars."
