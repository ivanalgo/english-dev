A woman has raised more than £3,500 to put fridge-freezers in inpatient rooms at the hospice which cared for her mother before she died.Helen Tottey's mother, Sue Tottey, was looked after by Compton Care in Wolverhampton, where she would often want ice lollies or ice cubes to help manage her symptoms.Sue Tottey, who was originally from West Bromwich but lived in Tipton, died at the age of 74 from pancreatic cancer.Compton Care has renovated 11 of the 18 rooms on its impatient unit, which now have a fridge-freezer each thanks to Ms Tottey's fundraising, allowing patients to keep chilled and frozen food and drinks at their bedside.
Ms Tottey visited the renovated rooms and said: "The fridge freezers are a relatively little thing, but I think they are a little thing that mean a lot."I got quite emotional when I came in. I think it is incredible what has been achieved so far and will make such a difference."While ice lollies and ice cubes were always readily available from staff, Ms Tottey felt that a fridge freezer in each room would be really beneficial and decided to support the hospice's room renovation appeal.Ms Tottey said: "We could not be more grateful for the care Mum received from Compton, but one of the things Mum picked up on was how nice it would be to have her own access to cold drinks, ice and ice lollies. "We decided we’d like to raise money for the fridges in Mum’s memory and to benefit future patients.”Compton Care said the refurbished rooms now featured a more calming, less environment, as well as interactive technology so patients can stay connected to family and friends at any time.The hospice is now appealing for support to help complete the final stage of its room transformation on its inpatient unit and renovate the remaining seven rooms.Rachel Overfield, chief executive of Compton Care, added: "The renovation of the rooms on our inpatient unit means we are able to provide the same expert clinical care, but in calm, homely surroundings designed to have a positive impact on wellbeing and symptom management."
