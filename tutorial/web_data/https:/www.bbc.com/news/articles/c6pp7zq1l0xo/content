The minister for social security wants to be able to change the minimum wage without consulting the public.Deputy Lyndsey Feltham proposed an amendment to the Employment Law meaning she would not have to refer to the Employment Forum when setting minimum wage rates.Currently the minister must refer to the forum, which carries out public consultations and makes recommendations to the government, before making any changes.The forum is a non-political consultative body which consults on the rate of minimum wage and other employment-related issues as directed by the social security minister. The Employment Forum has been contacted for comment.
In the proposal, the government said it was committed to raising the minimum wage to two-thirds of the average salary in Jersey by the end of 2026.The government originally set the target for the end of 2024 but delayed plans claiming it was not "feasible".Ms Feltham said it would "not be appropriate" to consult the Employment Forum within the next two years and that by bypassing the forum it would allow her to raise minimum wage to the right level by the end of March 2026.It proposed reinstating the forum automatically on 1 April 2026.The States is set to debate the proposal in the summer.
