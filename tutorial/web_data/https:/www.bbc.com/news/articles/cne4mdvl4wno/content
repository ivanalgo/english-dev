A tug-of-war team have been left "basically homeless", after equipment was removed from the community centre where they train.Worcester City Council removed weight training gear from Shap Drive Community Centre in Warndon after complaints that a child had been injured.Worcester Themmadi team manager Thomas Maphai Kondoor said it meant they "don't have any option or place to train."Worcester City Council said it was helping the team find a more appropriate venue to train in. 
In the meantime the team has begun training at a local park."All of these things have happened at the wrong time because we are halfway through the season and hosting a national competition on the 13 July and that is a very serious issue for us," Mr Kondoor said. "The council said we can't practice in the park because it could cause an issue for the children and we completely accept that because it's a public space."
"For seven people to lay on a rope and pull weights we need to train to make sure we have enough strength and man power so that we can perform well in the competition." As their competition in Tunbridge Wells this weekend quickly approaches the team remains hopeful their luck will change.Mr Kondoor added: "We're looking for private land anywhere in Malvern even if it is a tiny bit of land we would be so grateful and you would be supporting a local team."Worcester City Council said it was supporting the team to find a more suitable training venue following a range of complaints received in connection with their training arrangements at Shap Drive.
