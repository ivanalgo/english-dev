Volunteers at a Shropshire museum have said it will close in two years unless enough money is raised to repair the roof.It is predicted to cost up to Â£10,000 to fix tiles at the Market Drayton Museum and Resource Centre.Drayton Civic Society, which owns and manages the 17th Century building, have started a "buy a roof tile" campaign.Carole Higgins, chair and trustee, said: "Every penny we raise goes towards paying the bill."
Supporters can buy a nail or roof tile dedicated to "someone you love, or someone who loves Market Drayton," she said.She explained the Staffordshire blue tiles currently hang on hooks rather than being nailed on."You get a strong wind and they actually lift and come off and that's happened in a couple of places on the roof," she said."It's not leaking yet but we want to avoid that at all costs because it covers archives."The museum, a registered charity, comprises of three galleries telling the story of the town's development and everyday life. A former home, the building has also been used over the years as a butchers, bicycle shop and TV and radio sales establishment.The Civic Society, which bought the building 19 years ago, relies on donations to keep it running and Ms Higgins said she was confident people in the town would help."If we end up not raising the money and having to use our reserves to pay it we have enough money to run the museum for two years tops," she said."We know the lovely people of Market Drayton and we know we're going to raise it, but we need to raise it quickly."
Meanwhile, the Civic Society is also considering a move for the museum to a proposed Joule's Brewery development at The Stags Head.In a Facebook update in June, they told supporters the majority of members felt moving to the more "prominent, spacious" location would be a benefit.However, it emphasised plans were at an early stage and would be a "major undertaking" and "long-term" project.
