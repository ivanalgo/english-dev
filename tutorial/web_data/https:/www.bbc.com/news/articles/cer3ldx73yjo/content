Patients of a Staffordshire GP surgery have protested against services being relocated to two different sites.The move has affected 10,500 patients of Gordon Street Surgery in Burton-on-Trent, which was rated inadequate by the Care Quality Commission and had its contract terminated by the county's Integrated Care Board (ICB). As the NHS does not own the surgery building, patients are being split between a site near Queen's Hospital Burton and another at Hill Street, Stapenhill. Some patients were concerned their care would be compromised, but the ICB insisted patient safety was being prioritised.
"I'm utterly devastated for the community," said patient Fatima Tabussam, who claimed the ICB was risking and compromising people's health."Feelings are running high, we're receiving phone calls from people distressed, in tears, this surgery is in the heart of the community, people rely on it," said East Staffordshire councillor Paul Walker."I don't want people from this community trekking to the other side of town, because they can't afford to, and many of the elderly don't have cars," added mosque chairman Sajid Raja Ali.
Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent Integrated Care Board said it had to take action in a short space of time to ensure continuity of care for patients."This practice was rated by their patients as the worst practice in the whole of the country in 2022," said chief medical officer Dr Paul Edmondson-Jones."There comes a point where we can't continue to commission for this population an inadequate service that year after year is inadequate and not able to provide the right level of care and support," he added.The current two surgery site arrangement is expected to be in place for 12 months, as the ICB works on a long-term plan, which patients will be asked for their views on.
