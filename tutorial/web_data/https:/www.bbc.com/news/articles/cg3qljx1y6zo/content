Taxi fares are to rise by 30% across Warwick district after councillors approved an increase.This means the current daytime rate of £6 for a 2-mile (3.22km) trip would go up to £7.65 from May 2024.Warwick District Council has not increased the rates Hackney carriages can charge since 2014.During a consultation of operators, all except one called for fares to rise, with a number commenting a review had been left too long.
Lead licensing officer Rachael Russell said a phased rise had been looked at, but the authority sought to balance differing views from operators.Almost half told the authority they wanted a 40 to 50% fare increase, with a quarter saying it needed to be between 30 and 40%.“Since [2014] neighbouring authorities have increased [fares]," she said. "We feel it is probably appropriate to ask the trade every 18 months.“We definitely don’t want to leave it another 10 years, absolutely not, I acknowledge that,” she added.
The current daytime rate, which applies from 06:30 GMT until 22:00 GMT, is £3.40 for the first 700 yds (0.6km), then 20p per 100 yds (0.09km) after that and 10p per 30 seconds waiting.Cabs charge 50% higher for five or more passengers in the day or for fares overnight and double the day rate for five or more passengers overnight.Warwick district is among the 50 cheapest areas for a 2-mile journey nationally, with all neighbouring councils charging more following reviews within the past two years.
The new fares will be advertised and any objections would mean they go before the council's cabinet for a final decision.
