An entertainment venue in West Sussex which was badly damaged during a fire in a neighbouring restaurant has reopened.The Windmill Entertainment Centre in Littlehampton was forced to close on 10 August last year after a blaze devastated the nearby Harvester.Restoration work was carried out on the roof, boiler room and ceiling, while a new studio floor, auditorium carpet and skylight have been installed.Freedom Leisure general manager Matt Williams said: “The Windmill has been a cornerstone of community life, and we cannot wait to see it bustling with activity once more.”
The exterior of the building has also been repainted, while screenings at the Windmill Cinema, which also uses the centre, will begin on 1 July.
The first event will be a production of 1950s musical The Pajama Game performed by LPOS, formerly known as Littlehampton Players Operatic Society.Carol Birch, chair of Arun District Council’s housing and wellbeing committee, said: “The team who run the centre are very much looking forward to welcoming back all hirers of the facility and providing entertainment in this much-loved venue.”
