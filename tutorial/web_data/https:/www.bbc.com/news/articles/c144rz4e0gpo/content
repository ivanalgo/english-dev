An animal rescue charity is trying to find homes for more than 30 feral cats. Cats Protection Hornchurch contacted Pippa's Army for help after they received a call from a man about a large number of cats. Volunteers at Pippa's Army, which is based in Thurrock and Havering in Essex, rescue and support a variety of animals. They are now looking after the 30 feral cats. They say the demand for their service is "relentless". Linzi Fallows at the charity said: "It's a lot of cats to deal with in one hit. It's heart-wrenching. Every rescue centre I know is inundated with cats and dogs."
The charity has launched an appeal on social media to find people who are willing to give the cats somewhere dry and warm to stay, with access to food and medical attention when required. She said unlike domestic cats, feral cats "are not the kind of cats that you're going to be able to pick up and cuddle."We are lucky the call came through to Cats Protection in Hornchurch, which is funding this and neutering, otherwise we would not have the funding to do it."She added: "On the rescue side, we have over one hundred cats and kittens at present. It's literally non-stop. People have such a throw away culture nowadays."
