A grieving father from Kent has set off on a 220km (137mile) charity cycling challenge in memory of his son. David Grist, 56, from Brenzett, Kent, is undertaking the Coast-to-Coast ride from Whitehaven in Cumbria to Sunderland. Charlie Grist, 10, died from leukaemia five years ago. "He is always with me and around," Mr Grist said, describing his son as a "special lad". 
Mr Grist said he had done "some" training, including the Ride London event last month  but admitted trying to find hills on the Romney Marsh to train on had been "a challenge". Speaking to BBC Radio Kent, Mr Grist said: "It was so unexpected, he was such a healthy little boy and he got leukaemia just before his 7th birthday. "We nearly got to three years and he relapsed and all the odds went down."We had to say goodbye to him almost five years ago which was incredibly sad." 
Money raised from the charity ride will go to Kent-based children's charity Tree of Hope, a beneficiary of several other challenges , including triathlons, that Mr Grist has undertaken in his son's memory. "The Tree of Hope is such an amazing charity and I'm so lucky to be able to work for them supporting sick and disabled children and we try and take the stress out of what is already a stressful life for parents, and I can totally relate to the troubles." Mr Grist began his ride on Friday morning and is expected to complete it on Sunday.
