An endangered secretary bird chick has been successfully hatched at Longleat Safari Park.The chick, whose gender is not yet known, was born two weeks ago to six-year-old mum Janine and eight-year-old dad Kevin, who have lived at the site near Warminster, Wiltshire, since 2018.The birds, who are of the Sagittarius Serpentarius species, are normally found across Sub-Saharan Africa and are known for hunting snakes and reptiles.Leader keeper lakes and birds Matt Hardy said it was "exciting to have a successful hatch of an endangered species", and hopes it will allow the park to "create a new breeding programme in the future". “We are providing extra smaller food items for the parents to give to the chick and as secretary birds can be very protective of their nests and chicks, we are ensuring they have as much space and peace and quiet as possible,” he added.
The giant birds, who are endangered and are in large decline due to habitat degradation, hunting and trade.The longest of any bird of prey, they use their long legs to stamp on prey exerting a force up to six times their body weight in just 15 milliseconds.In the wild, secretary birds, who mate for life and also hunt as a couple, have a lifespan of 12-15 years and up to 19 years in captivity.
