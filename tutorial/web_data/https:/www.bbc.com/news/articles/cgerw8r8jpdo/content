A mum-of-12 said she “just wanted to give something back” after donating money to the hospital which cared for her newborn with Down’s syndrome.Jenna Jones, 39, who lives on the Priors Estate, in Bury St Edmunds, gave birth to her daughter at West Suffolk Hospital last December.After being born, the tiny tot, whose dad is Kenny Jones, 37, was diagnosed with Down’s syndrome.The level of care shown to the couple and their newborn touched Mr and Mrs Jones, who have since donated £205 to the hospital’s neonatal unit via the My WiSH Charity.
They have also given £205 to the Down’s Syndrome Association, having raised the funds after launching a JustGiving campaign.Mrs Jones, who herself is one of eight siblings, said: “I just wanted to give something back to the hospital for the great care they gave us.“[Our daughter] still has a few health conditions, but she is fine and the staff at the hospital were amazing and looked after her really, really well.“While she was in the unit I returned to the maternity ward and had to go back and forth for her feeds but they cared for her so, so well.”
Given it was the Christmas period at the time of the birth, staff also decided to gift presents to Mr and Mrs Jones’ 11 other children over the course of their hospital stay.Speaking after the couple handed over the donation, Sally Daniels, fundraising manager for My WiSH Charity, said: “Our neonatal staff take such great care of, not only the baby, but the whole family, and they love to see everyone back for an update.“Thank you to everyone who has supported Jenna and her family with their fundraising.”
