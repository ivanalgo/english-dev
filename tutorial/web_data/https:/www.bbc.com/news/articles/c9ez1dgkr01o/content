Plans have been announced for more large electricity cables to be installed across Lincolnshire. National Grid has unveiled a proposal for two cables to travel 400 miles on the floor of the North Sea from Scotland to England, coming ashore on the Lincolnshire coast.They will be known as Eastern Greenlink 3 and Eastern Greenlink 4.The company said it wanted to bring more renewable energy from Scottish windfarms into homes and businesses in the midlands and south of England.
Once ashore, the cables will be buried underground for 62 miles (100km) before connecting to two proposed converter stations at Walpole, which will serve a new substation proposed for the same area.The project forms part of what National Grid calls The Great Grid Upgrade.The company said the cables were needed because the existing system did not have the capacity to transport the amount of electricity being produced by windfarms in Scotland. James Goode, from National Grid, said: “Eastern Green Link 3 and Eastern Green Link 4 are a critical part of the new electricity infrastructure required for the UK to reach net zero. "Harnessing the full potential of Britain’s clean energy resources will enable us to be less dependent on global fossil fuels and will play a critical role in supporting the nation’s future security of supply." 
The proposal is in addition to, but separate from, a plan to send power, via pylons, across the Lincolnshire Wolds - close to a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty - which Lincolnshire County Council has already strongly objected to.Another set of high capacity electricity cables already come ashore at Anderby Creek, one of the proposed locations. These bring power from windfarms in Denmark and from the Triton Knoll wind turbine field in the North Sea. 
A number of public consultation events will be held by National Grid along the proposed route of the scheme.
