More than four in 10 (42%) drivers in Norfolk involved in a road traffic collision said they were distracted before it happened, new figures have revealed.Norfolk County Council released the statistics at the start of a campaign to try to encourage people to pay more attention while driving.It said the 'Stay Focused' campaign would offer residents and businesses free training to help keep drivers' minds on the road.In a survey of 600 Norfolk residents it carried out, more than half of drivers (57%) admitted they had no clear recollection of parts of journeys they had been on.
Just over a fifth (22%) said they had missed a turning on a familiar journey in the last year, with the main causes of distraction including passengers, sat-navs and tiredness.The council said it had partnered with road safety firm Drive iQ to provide online courses on staying focused while driving.The company’s CEO, Richard Hill, said people were often distracted by other things going through their minds.“Pressure, work, home-life – more often than not, when we’re in a vehicle, people are thinking about other things than the primary task, which is driving," he said.
The campaign is being backed by other services, including Norfolk Police.Ch Insp Vicky McParland said driving while distracted was “as destructive as drink or drug-driving”.“The road situation in front of you can change within seconds and you will not be able to react quickly enough to prevent a collision,” she added.
