Parkrun members fear their weekly event could be put in jeopardy by plans to build temporary sea defences for a new nuclear power station.As part of the construction process for Sizewell C in Suffolk, a change to a footpath is planned close to the beach.A spokesperson for the Sizewell Parkrun said: "We are aware of the proposed temporary footpath and we‘re working with Sizewell C representatives."A Sizewell C spokesperson said temporary fencing would be in place during construction and removed after "roughly two years".
The current single lap Sizewell Parkrun begins in the sand dunes and heads north past the power station towards RSPB Minsmere before returning along the beach. It is described as "mostly well-drained, firm, sandy, grassland tracks".
Members of the running group have expressed their concerns over the proposed footpath diversion on Suffolk County Council's planning register, where runner Matt Bailey said: "If possible, can the path be wider to accommodate the needs of Sizwell Parkrun, which would be unable to continue with the existing proposals."Other members of the group have contacted the BBC, including Stuart and Carol Fagg, to say the path needs to be wider and more suitable than is being proposed, and have called on Sizewell C bosses to make changes to their plans.A Sizewell C spokesperson said: "As we look to construct our temporary sea defences and cross-shore infrastructure, so we can maximise delivery of construction materials by sea, we’ll be creating a temporary diversion around an 800m portion of a pathway along Sizewell beach from September 2024. "There will still be normal access to Sizewell beach and the sand dunes during this period."
The spokesperson said an alternative "geogrid mesh" path would be in place during the construction of Sizewell C, with ramps installed over the dunes. It would be maintained and regularly inspected by the Sizewell team.Temporary fencing along the western side of the path, beside Sizewell C, would be added during the building of temporary sea defences, they added, and removed in two years."The proposals for the diversion of the coastal path formed part of our Development Consent Order (DCO) consultations and is approved as part of the DCO," the spokesperson said.We remain in contact with the Suffolk County Council Planning and Public Rights of Way Officers, so that it meets all the access requirements of a public rights of way diversion."
