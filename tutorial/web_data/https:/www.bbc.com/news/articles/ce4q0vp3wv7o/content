Herefordshire's only running track, which had been under threat, has officially reopened following significant refurbishment.The running surface was originally laid in 1988 but fell into disrepair, putting its licence to hold competitions at risk.However, a community fundraising effort helped raise £600,000 to refurbish it, ahead of a reopening on Tuesday with hundreds of people invited for the ribbon cutting.Ben Skinner, from Save Hereford's Track, said the group was over the moon that the venue could now reopen.
He said: "At first we thought we’d bitten off a bit too much [for us] to chew."We had to raise £600,000 to save our local track. Through one huge community effort we’ve managed to do it, and here we are 18 months later with a brand new track in Hereford."
The group raised the money through javelin masterclasses with Paralympic champion Dan Pembroke, hammer masterclasses with Olympic athlete Lorraine Shaw and local quiz nights. The track is of particular importance to Mr Pembroke, who told the BBC: "[The track] being here was the sole reason why I had the ambition to follow the dream to become a Paralympian. It inspired me. "If it wasn’t here and we’d have lost it, maybe other people wouldn’t have realised their dream. So it’s a legacy going on for future athletes."In a rural area, having a local race track is crucial for Mr Pembroke, who is visually impaired and cannot drive."If it weren't for this track, I'd have to travel an hour away by car, but I can't drive so it would need to be public transport, which takes a good three hours one way," he said."So this is absolutely vital for my preparations."
