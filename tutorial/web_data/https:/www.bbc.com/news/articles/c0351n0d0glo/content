Thailand has expanded its visa-free entry scheme to 93 countries and territories as it seeks to revitalize its tourism industry.Visitors can stay in the South-East Asian nation for up to 60 days under the new scheme that took effect on Monday,Previously, passport holders from 57 countries were allowed to enter without a visa.Tourism is a key pillar of the Thai economy, but it has not fully recovered from the pandemic.Thailand recorded 17.5 million foreign tourists arrivals in the first six months of 2024, up 35% from the same period last year, according to official data. However, the numbers pale in comparison to pre-pandemic levels.Most of the visitors were from China, Malaysia and India.Tourism revenue during the same period came in at 858 billion baht ($23.6bn; £18.3bn), less than a quarter of the government's target.Millions of tourists flock to Thailand every year for its golden temples, white sand beaches, picturesque mountains and vibrant night life.The revised visa-free rules are part of a broader plan to boost tourism.Also on Monday, Thailand introduced a new five-year visa for remote workers, that allows holders to stay for up to 180 days each year.The country will also allow visiting students, who earn a bachelor’s degree or higher in Thailand, to stay for one year after graduation to find a job or travel.In June, authorities announced an extension of a waiver on hoteliers' operating fees for two more years. They also scrapped a proposed tourism fee for visitors flying into the country.However some stakeholders are concerned that the country's infrastructure may not be able to keep up with travellers' demands. “If more people are coming, it means the country as a whole... has to prepare our resources to welcome them," said Kantapong Thananuangroj, president of the Thai Tourism Promotion Association."If not, [the tourists] may not be impressed with the experience they have in Thailand and we may not get a second chance," he said.Chamnan Srisawat, president of the Tourism Council of Thailand, said he foresees a "bottleneck in air traffic as the incoming flights may not increase in time to catch up with the demands of the travellers".Some people have also raised safety concerns after rumours that tourists have been kidnapped and sent across the border to work in scam centres in Myanmar or Cambodia.A fatal shooting in Bangkok's most famous shopping mall last year has also caused concern among visitors.
