A warning from the environmental watchdog for people to avoid swimming at Portobello beach in Edinburgh has been lifted after the latest water quality samples showed there was no risk to the public.The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) issued the advice against bathing on Thursday after a routine test revealed the presence of bacteria that could be harmful to human health.However, the results of a secondary test taken on Friday confirmed water quality had returned to "satisfactory" levels.The affected section of coastline from Pipe Lane to Joppa Rocks has now been reopened.
Charlie Allanson-Oddy, a volunteer for Portobello Water Collective, told BBC Scotland News they had been testing the water at the beach every week for the last year."Just over 80% of our results would be considered unsafe by Sepa for E-coli levels," he said."We record these with Sepa and Scottish Water."He said he wanted to know which bacteria had been found to prompt the warning.Mr Allanson-Oddy added: "Thousands of folk use the beach, water and promenade every day, even in the most inclement weathers."He said the situation had been "unacceptable and shameful".
Kirsty Carver - the owner of Soul Water Sauna, which is used by many wild swimmers at the beach - said she had lost 50% of her business since the warning signs were erected.She said: "I emailed everyone that was booked in with me over the weekend and I've had a lot of people rescheduling."I didn't want people to have to change their plans but equally I didn't want them to have their sauna experience ruined and not to be able to use the sauna and sea as expected."It is disappointing."Ms Carver said there was water pollution on the beach at Portobello "almost every day"."We know this because of the testing we have done at Figgate Burn, which shows the water quality can be poor but there is nothing being done about it."The council aren't putting their hand up and saying, yes there is a problem and we need to fix it. They are not doing anything about it. It's very frustrating."
A Sepa spokesman said: “Following visual checks of the beach and water sampling by our officers, Sepa has confirmed there is no impact on water quality at Portobello Central bathing water and will remove the signs advising against bathing.“Water sampling will continue to take place throughout the bathing season as part of routine testing.“We continue to work with our partners to improve Scotland’s water environment and make our summer visits to the beach safer and more enjoyable.”
