A monument to the last man rescued by Victorian heroine Grace Darling has been granted Grade II listed status.James Gall was one of five men rescued by Ms Darling when the SS Forfarshire sank off the coast of Northumberland in 1838.The grave monument, in Barrow-in-Furness, features a 10ft (3m) lighthouse and pays tribute to Mr Gall and Ms Darling.It has been listed as part of efforts by Historic England to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the RNLI.
Ms Darling and her father, who was the keeper of Longstone Lighthouse, rescued the men during a storm using a small fishing boat, known as a coble. Her father then returned with two of the survivors to save another four sailors.Following the rescue, Mr Gall stayed at the lighthouse for two days to recover from his injuries.
The stone monument is located at Barrow Cemetery and bears an inscription dedicated to the rescue.It reads: "Erected by public subscription in memory of James Gall, one of the crew of the 'Forfarshire' [died 25 December 1888] and to commemorate the heroism of Grace Darling in rescuing nine men from the wreck of that unfortunate vessel AD 1838."
Historic England is urging people to take pictures of listed landmarks and add them to its Missing Pieces Project, which aims to help communities discover important sites in their area.Duncan Wilson, Historic England's CEO, said: "This fascinating collection of historic sites tell the stories of the men, women and communities who have made our seas safer over the past 200 years. "Their dedication, bravery and sacrifice have helped to save so many lives and their stories inspire us."
