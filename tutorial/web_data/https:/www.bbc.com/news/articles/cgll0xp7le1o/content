Fiona Bruce and the Antiques Roadshow team are coming to Essex to film an episode of the 47th series of the BBC show. It will be filmed on Friday at Firstsite Art Gallery in Colchester. Other areas that will be visited this summer included Derbyshire, the Scottish Borders, Anglesey, Belfast and west London. The team said they could not wait "to see what treasures you've got to surprise and delight us [with]" at the ticketed event.
The team are on the hunt for a mix of antiques, family heirlooms and vintage treasures with the help of specialists in the fields of jewellery, silver, ceramics, glass, pictures, rare books, clocks and watches, militaria, and collectables.Firstsite Art Gallery said its building would remain open to everyone on the day of filming from 10:00 BST to 22:00 BST, but general visitors could not access the Antiques Roadshow event without a ticket.Presenter Fiona Bruce said: "I know we'll see items of great quality and value - but I'm always drawn in by a moving personal story too. "They are what often stick longest in my memory. And I'm determined to improve my record on Basic, Better, Best. Surely I've got to get more of them right this year."
BBC Studios series editor, Robert Murphy, added: "We want the roadshow to be for everyone, and we want to see those special items that mean something to you. "Last year, we saw a dazzling range of items: jewellery bought for a few pounds at a car boot sale, an Olympic torch, a Rolex that had been through a lawnmower, punk T-shirts, a two-thousand-year-old carved stone head, a silver jug used in a royal ritual. "And most memorably, a Victoria Cross medal awarded to a Sikh solider in World War II that was valued at a quarter of a million pounds. We can't wait to see what treasures youâ€™ve got to surprise and delight us at this year's shows."
