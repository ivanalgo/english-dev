Signs asking for dogs to be put on leads at a popular walking spot have been "stolen".Forestry England, which manages the Cyril Hart Arboretum between Coleford and Cinderford, put up the signs earlier this month.The decision to place the three signs around the fenced site came after rangers said they had witnessed a rise in dog-related issues, such as poo not being picked up and attacks from dogs that were running loose.Forestry England told the BBC it hopes to replace the signs "as soon as possible".
Some people had stopped visiting the Arboretum altogether due to the increase in free roaming dogs, Forestry England said.The organisation said it was concerned that, now the signs are missing, visitors may walk their dogs off the lead without realising that is banned on the site.Emily Fergusson, recreation manager for Forestry England Forest of Dean, said when the signs were put up: "We know that most people are respectful of others and have well-behaved dogs, but unfortunately we can’t ignore the growing number of problems."Dogs are still very much welcome in the arboretum, but we ask that you respect our decision and keep them on a lead during your visit."Our job is to look after the Arboretum, and make sure all visitors feel safe and welcome.”
