A plea to the public to heed safety warnings has been issued as a "sustained period" of tree felling begins in the Tweed Valley.Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) said it was vital people observed exclusion zones with heavy-duty machinery on site.It said safety cordons around felling areas were large due to the risk of "chainshot".It occurs when high speed chains that drive a harvester break and chain links fly off with the force and equivalent impact of a bullet.FLS said every effort would be made to have "minimal impact" on recreational activities in the area.However, it said it would mean some restrictions to access for some mountain bike trails and other diversions being put in place.
Colin Binnie, FLS' south region deputy regional manager, said: "The forests in this region support a wide range of recreational activities offering health and well-being benefits for the public."However, productive forestry is a core priority for us, essentially because the income generated from timber sales funds the majority of FLS' work."These trees have reached commercial maturity and need to be harvested as part of managing healthy and resilient forests."He said the work was "especially important" to reduce the likelihood of significant disruption due to storm damage.Mr Binnie added: "We appreciate that the Tweed Valley is home to really popular mountain biking, walking and horse-riding trails and this work will cause some inconvenience, but it's vital that we get this felling done."The work is anticipated to be ongoing throughout this year and into early 2025 and will impact access to sites including Glentress, Traquair, Caberston and Thornielee.
