A man who was driving a car that shot into the air at a roundabout before crashing and killing two of his passengers has been jailed.Aaron Smith, 29, of Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire, lost control of his BMW in Rushden resulting in the deaths of Brian Sibanda, 21, and Carrie McLellan, 41.He was sentenced  at Northampton Crown Court  to eight years and eight months in prison after admitting two counts of causing death by dangerous driving.Det Con Lydia Watters, who led Northamptonshire Police’s investigation, said she hoped the "families can take a small amount of comfort from the fact there has been some element of justice delivered".
Another man in his 20s was also in the car when it crashed at a roundabout in John Clark Way on 3 June 2022, police said.The car had been spotted being driven erratically, overshooting junctions and above the speed limits.Mr Sibanda's mother described her son as "loving, caring and considerate". In a statement read out at Smith's sentencing on 3 May, she said how she called her son "my gentle giant because that is exactly what he was - he was very gentle".Ms McLellan "lit up the room and was the life and soul of the party," her partner told the court. "She would always have a smile on her face and would always have time to give advice or cuddles to friends and family when needed.”Det Con Watters said the crash had been "complex" to investigate."Aaron Smith made a choice and that choice was to drive dangerously and way beyond the limits of the road," she said.“As a result, he became responsible for the deaths of two much-loved people and I hope he spends a lot of time reflecting on this fact in prison and also when he is released.“Our thoughts remain with both Carrie's and Brian’s families and will do so long into the future.”
