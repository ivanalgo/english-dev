A hospice that cares for people who are suffering with life-limiting illnesses has created a garden to celebrate its 55th anniversary. Wyre Forest charity Kemp Hospice created the Butterfly Celebration Garden to go on display throughout July at Brinton Park in Kidderminster.The garden is one of many events being held by the hospice to honour its work providing care and support in the Wyre Forest community."Itâ€™s a place where we invite everyone to visit and take a moment to remember and celebrate those in our lives who may no longer be here with us," the charity said.
Kemp Hospice offers specialist care and support to patients, families and carers who are living with life-limiting illnesses like cancer or motor neurone disease, and bereavement."We are so pleased to have created the Butterfly Celebration Garden this Summer," Jayne Sargeant, from the charity, said."The garden is there for the whole community to visit, not just those with an existing connection to Kemp, and we invite anyone who may wish to secure their own butterfly to do so on our website before time runs out."The art display will be taken down on 21 July.
