Architect George Clarke said he was left "buzzing" and impressed after seeing young people's housing designs.The Sunderland-born television presenter challenged children aged between five and 18 to come up with designs to overhaul a part of Fatfield as part of the 60th anniversary celebrations of new town Washington. The courtyard-style housing designs were showcased in a display at Washington Arts Centre attended by Mr Clarke and North East mayor Kim McGuiness.Mr Clarke, who founded the charity Ministry of Building, Innovation and Education (MOBIE) said the aim was to get young people involved in defining the future of housing.
He said: "Hand on heart it is an honour, it's fantastic and I'm genuinely buzzing to be here."I had butterflies when I woke up this morning and never usually have them for anything."
Mr Clarke said to be back at Washington Arts Centre, where he had not been since he "was a kid, with all my friends and family"  was a "real privilege"."But it's more about the kids, seeing them engaged," he said. "They've really jumped in with everything they've got."He added that he wanted young people to have a voice to "define what their future was about" by designing cities and towns."They are obviously very passionate about the environment and the future of the planet and homes play a key part in that," Mr Clarke added.
Young people were tasked with coming up with contemporary designs that blended in with the features of the original 1960s plan.Mr Clarke, who lived in Washington as a child, said it was like a construction site in the early days but that people realised they were part of "something special".He said: "It was pedestrianised so I could walk to school and feel really, really safe."There was a sense of community that came about from brilliant design."Ms McGuiness said she wanted children to be involved in shaping the design of the North East."I want them to have a great house here and I want them to be thinking about having careers in architecture, design and building," she added.
