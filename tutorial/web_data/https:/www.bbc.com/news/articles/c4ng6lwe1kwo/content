England winger Lauren Hemp said returning to play in the county she grew up in was an "extra special" feeling.The 23-year-old won a penalty for the Lionesses in front of a busy Carrow Road crowd in Norwich on Friday.Her side beat the Republic of Ireland 2-1 to take one step closer to Euro 2025 qualification."The crowd made it very special - cheering everyone's names and it [the stadium] being packed out was great," Hemp told BBC Radio Norfolk.
Georgia Stanway converted the penalty won by Hemp to double England's lead in the 57th minute during the routine win, only dampened by a goal for the visitors in the 94th minute.Hemp, from North Walsham, said the crowd provided an "unbelievable" atmosphere.
"We put on a good performance, I thought we dominated throughout the game," she said. "It’s extra special for me to come here and play. I’ve played here once before but obviously it’s not a regular occurrence so it’s nice to experience that every now and then."The left-footer, who represents Manchester City at club level, received a warm round of applause around the ground when she was substituted with just a minute to play."It’s nice to be regarded quite highly around here. It’s a place where I grew up and it’s so nice to see everyone," Hemp added.Among the fans keen to see her were Isla and Izzy, who travelled from Stamford, Lincolnshire.They described Hemp as a "good performer" who "fires the ball" in to the box.
