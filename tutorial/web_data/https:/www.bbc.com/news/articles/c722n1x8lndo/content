Five artists are to hold workshops across the North Pennines to tell the story of the region's mining heritage.The events include knitting to recreate shawls worn by smelters and another to produce rag rugs; floor coverings made from old material scraps and often found in mining homes.Abi Baker, artist-in-residence, says they hope to help people to feel "a sense of pride" in the area's heritage.It is part of a project called the Land of Lead and Silver, led by the North Pennines National Landscape Partnership, which has been awarded Â£2m from the National Lottery Heritage Fund.
"My workshops will be mostly pottery," Ms Baker explained. "I'll provide all the materials and do a demonstration to help people get started making something inspired by mining."Anyone can come along but I'd particularly like to see young local adults take part and help them think a bit more about not only mining, but how it dominated life in this area for so long."
At almost 2,000 sq km, the North Pennines is the second largest of the 46 "National Landscapes" in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. From the mid-1700s it was dominated by lead mining, with its heyday in the 19th century when it provided employment for many thousands. By the mid 20th century the last few lead mines had closed leaving abandoned spoil heaps, mine shafts and chimneys. 
All the workshops in this project will take place in July at places including Barnard Castle, Bowlees and Nenthead and some of the work produced will be displayed in an exhibition at Bowlees Visitor Centre. Ms Baker hopes people will learn about both art and mining.   "I want people to connect with the area in a deeper, more personal way and to feel proud to have roots there, because it is such a special place," she said.
