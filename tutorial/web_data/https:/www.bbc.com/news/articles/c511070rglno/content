People in Blackpool are more than twice as likely to die from heart disease before the age of 75 than those in the wealthiest parts of England, according to new data from a charity.Figures from the British Heart Foundation (BHF) show the Lancashire seaside resort had a death rate of 133 per 100,000 of population, compared with 50 per 100,000 in the least deprived areas – the biggest gap in the country.Manchester, Barking and Dagenham, Nottingham and Hull also saw some of the highest death rates from early heart disease in England.Hart, in Hampshire, Waverley, Mid Sussex and Elmbridge had some of the lowest, according to the figures sampled between 2016-22.
The charity said its study showed premature death rates from heart disease reached the highest level in a decade in 2022.It said more research was needed to understand the reasons, but there was an established link between heart health and wealth - with people living in the poorest areas facing poverty, pollution, fewer healthy affordable food choices, as well as poorer working and living conditions.Other factors include more people living with complications linked to Covid-19 and ongoing NHS pressures, the foundation said.It has called for more research and action to reduce the divide between the richest and poorest areas growing further.Men living in the most deprived parts of England saw the biggest increase in premature death rates from heart diseases in 2022, the study showed.Their rate has risen to 153 per 100,000 people up from 129 per 100,000 in 2019. This is nearly double the nation’s average premature death rate from heart disease.

The gap in premature death rates from cardiovascular disease between women living in the poorest and richest areas has also grown, but at a slower pace, the BHF said.Tackling the many causes of health inequalities is crucial, the BHF said.These include key drivers of poor health, such as obesity, diets high in fat, too much sugar and salt, smoking, alcohol consumption, high blood pressure and diabetes.Chief executive Dr Charmaine Griffiths said: "We’re in the grip of a historic heart crisis.“It is shameful in this day and age that someone can be at much greater risk of dying young from cardiovascular disease just because of where they live and how much money they have.“More people will lose loved ones to heart disease through no fault of their own."
In 2023 the government announced its Major Conditions Strategy to help reduce deaths from heart disease as well as conditions such as cancer and dementia.It is due to be published in full later this year. The BHF said an interim report published by the Department of Health & Social Care last summer "made clear the scale and urgency" of the rising tide of cardiovascular disease in the UK."But as the data now shows, there has been limited progress made to tackle this major cause of ill health," it added.Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, associate medical director at the BHF, said:“The gap in heart health between rich and poor is now widening at an alarming rate, and it’s happening at a time when the NHS is already struggling. "Urgent intervention is long overdue to prevent heart disease happening in the first place and to make heart care better, faster and fairer for everyone.”
