Jones also pleaded guilty to one count of causing death by driving while uninsured.He will be sentenced on 21 June, with Judge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke warning him that “an immediate custodial sentence” would follow given the “serious offences” for which he has pleaded guilty.In a tribute released after her death, Ms Mabbitt, from Aberfan, was described by her family as “a wonderful daughter, granddaughter, sister, auntie and cousin”.“She was the most kind, gentle soul who would do anything to help anyone,” they added.“Our family are devastated, there are no words to describe the heartache and pain we are feeling.”
