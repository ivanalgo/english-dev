A coastal town will be getting 139 new homes despite fears of a “serious accident” on the neighbouring roads.Somerset Council’s planning committee voted unanimously to back the proposals by Edenstone Homes for Watchet, adding that the highways team had no objections.However, locals have expressed fears about the safety of pedestrians on Doniford Road, which has no pavement.Alan Dyer, who lives in Williton, said he was concerned that the extra traffic from the new homes would lead to a “serious accident”.
The site straddles three agricultural fields either side of Normandy Avenue and Cherry Tree Way, a short distance from the Liddymore Park development of 250 homes currently being constructed by Summerfield Developments.The main access will be from a new junction on Doniford Road at the site’s eastern edge.Of the 139 homes planned for the site, 49 will be affordable, with the homes ranging from one-bedroom flats to four-bedroom houses.But Mr Dyer told the committee on 1 May: “The road from Williton to Doniford has a number of dangers. "It is narrow, it has no pavement, a large part of it has no verge, with hedges immediately adjacent to the road.“Pupils, some accompanied by parents, use the road to cycle and walk to school.“We need serious vision. We don’t need a serious accident to make us think.”
Matthew Kendrick, director of Grass Roots Planning, representing the developer,  said that Edenstone Homes had “engaged positively and pro-actively” with the council and “gone further” than the standards set out in the outline approval.Councillor Andy Hadley said: “Our highways team hasn’t reached any objections – I would find it very difficult to refuse permission on a highway issue.“They do seem with the affordable housing to have set a good example. I am struggling to find any planning reasons to object to this.”The committee voted unanimously to approve the revised plans.Follow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.
