Firefighters have moved into a carbon-neutral emergency services hub.Staff from Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service (TWFRS) have carried out their first shifts from the Hebburn Community tri-station in South Tyneside, with Northumbria Police and North East Ambulance Service due to join them later this month.The building has more than 340 photovoltaic panels, which generate up to 100% of the clean renewable electricity required to run the site.TWFRS said the station was "the first of its kind in the UK to be completely carbon neutral".
Peter Heath, chief fire officer at TWFRS, said: "All three organisations operating under one roof represents our vision to not only work alongside our blue light colleagues in the heart of the community, but do so in a collaborative way that adds value to our communities."He added the project also tied in with the organisation's aim to reduce its carbon footprint.The site includes ground source heat pumps, a wildflower meadow, electric vehicle and cycle charging facilities.
The new tri-station is between Marine Drive and Campbell Park Road in the town, and replaced the fire station on Victoria Road West.Hebburn Community Fire Station shut earlier this week after being operational for nearly 60 years.Stuart Holliday, of North East Ambulance Service, said being based in the same building would help co-operation between emergency services.He said: "Co-location enables us to learn from each other and form strong individual relationships, so that if we are asked to respond together to incidents, we can work with a better understanding of each otherâ€™s capabilities and provide safe and responsive care to all."
