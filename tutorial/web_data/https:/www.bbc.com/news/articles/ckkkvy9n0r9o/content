A council has performed a U-turn on its decision to repair a 130-year-old bridge this year.On 14 June, Durham County Council said the Causeway Bridge in Wolsingham would close on 22 July for several months so "critical" refurbishment could be carried out.Delays could result in further deterioration, it said at the time. But now the local authority has decided to do just that after outcry from residents.Lynn Ramsay, who lives in Wolsingham, said the closure would have cut vital pedestrian access to doctors and shops for too long. The council did not comment further.
The council had planned to remove the existing road surface and repair the concrete below, and to replace steel within the bridge.
Ms Ramsay, who lives on the south side of the river, said she understood the bridge needed to be refurbished but the fact its closure meant a lack of pedestrian access across the River Wear for 20 weeks was a major oversight."If we don't have a pedestrian crossing, we can't get to the pharmacy, we can't get to any social things," she said.She said there was a nearby field that had footpaths which people used to cross the river, but it was not flat and would be difficult if someone was carrying shopping or had mobility issues.The road closure would have also meant a 35-mile round trip by car across the river from Ms Ramsay's village, she said.
The council had not detailed to residents why the repairs had to be done and had "gone about it all wrong", Ms Ramsay added."Repair the bridge, but make temporary arrangements," she said.Independent councillor John Shuttleworth said it was important to "listen to the views of residents and road users" and the council would try and find out how to minimise impact on residents when it did the works in the future.It is now looking to do the work next spring.
