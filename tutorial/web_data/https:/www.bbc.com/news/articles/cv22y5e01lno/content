The Mayor of West Yorkshire has said the closure of Bradford Interchange bus station has been "horrendous at times". Ongoing issues caused by the closure of the bus station were discussed by members of West Yorkshire Combined Authority(WYCA) at a meeting on Thursday.The authority previously announced surveys were under way on the structure to determine whether it could be repaired or would need to be replaced.West Yorkshire mayor Tracy Brabin said: "It has been horrendous at times but our focus is to make things as easy as possible."
The station was shut at the beginning of the year due to safety concerns following a collapse of concrete in an underground car park area.Ms Brabin added: "The people of Bradford have shown great patience. "It has been really difficult, and I know people are very, very frustrated."We want to reassure the public we are working flat out with partners to come to the right decision about the future of the Interchange, bearing in mind the critical importance of public safety."In January, the BBC spoke to bus users who described the situation as a "fiasco".
Bradford Council leader Susan Hinchcliffe said people in the city were "hugely frustrated"."We want to see plans in place regardless of what the outcome of the surveys are."When that happens, we want to immediately implement the right solution."It can’t happen soon enough," she added.Dave Haskins, interim director of transport operations at the WYCA, said potential sites for a temporary bus station for the city were being sought and the aim was finding a site that could be "delivered quickly".Leeds councillor Alan Lamb said: "Everyone appreciates these are long-term issues, but what has been reported back to me is how difficult it is at the moment for passengers."I’ve heard of bus users in tears because they don’t know where to get their bus."Is there any way to get more bodies on the ground so those passengers who are struggling have someone to go to?"He was told that work to improve services for passengers was ongoing.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
