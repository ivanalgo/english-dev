An event in the south of the Isle of Man showcasing the agricultural industry attracted about 15,000 visitors, organisers have said.The Southern District Agricultural Show took place on Saturday and Sunday at Orrisdale Farm in Ballasalla.Show secretary Zoe Hampton said it was the first completely rain-free show for more than a decade, which meant it was "very well-attended" on both days.The annual event included local produce and trade stands, a tractor and vintage car parade, dog agility, show jumping and saw Tom and Lee Cain's limousine heifer crowned the 2024 Supreme Champion.
It marked the second year the father and son from Colby took home the top prize in the livestock classes at the southern event.Lee Cain told Manx Radio the heifer was "the best we have ever had".This year's win was "unexpected" as it was not common for a heifer that was "so young to do so well", Tom Cain added.First reserve was awarded to Alan and Alison Rothwell for their beltex lamb, Claire Baldwin took second reserve with her shire hors, while third reserve went to Rhian and Alec Masson for their Ayrshire heifer.
Ms Hampton said that there were "so many people involved" over the weekend that made the event possible, including the stewards, the judges, and the volunteers, which made it a "real community event"."They turn up on the day year after year, some without us even asking them, they just come and help," she added.
