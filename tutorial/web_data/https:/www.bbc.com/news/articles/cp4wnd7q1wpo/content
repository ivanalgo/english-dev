A Lincolnshire animal rescue centre said they were "struggling to cope" with “unprecedented’ demand for their help.The Lincs Ark cat, kitten and rabbit rescue has temporarily closed their doors for the first time in 22 years.Michele Franks, 65, from the charity, said they “couldn't handle” the growing number of abandoned animals which need care.“The calls do not stop, something has to be done,” she said.
Ms Franks said the charity, based in Holbeach, had organised a waiting list but said she had no other option but to temporarily close their doors entirely.“It is horrible, our hands are tied,” she said.According to Ms Franks, there are a large number of stray cats in Boston and Holbeach.“There is nothing we can do, the few rescues which are around are all full,” she added.
“Recently we took in a new-born kitten who had its placenta sack still attached.“It was born on an industrial estate; people just chuck their cats away” she said.Ms Franks hopes "something can be done" to ease pressure on rescue centres."We are tired, rescue centres are all tired," she told BBC Radio Lincolnshire.Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
