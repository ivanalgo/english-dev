A surgeon has developed a table to help patients feel more comfortable during hand surgery.The invention was thought up by Matthew Gardiner, a consultant hand and plastic surgeon at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, Berkshire.Traditionally, patients had to lie flat during surgery, which many found challenging.But the prototype, costing almost £8,000, enables people to sit up and place their hand on the table while the procedure is carried out.
Mr Gardiner, who is also associate medical director for research at Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, said patient comfort and safety were the main drivers behind the idea."Many have conditions that make lying flat very difficult and uncomfortable," he said. "Some ended up having general anaesthesia only because they couldn’t tolerate lying flat whilst awake.”The prototype, which was trialed at Heatherwood Hospital in Ascot, saw patients able to sit up and read while their operations were carried out.Many chose to watch their surgeries, although the table’s design includes a screen option for those who would rather not.
The invention was one of the successful bids at last year’s CEO Change Challenge, the hospital trust’s annual competition which aims to get frontline staff more involved in delivering change.Mark Lee, product manager at Anetic Aid - the company that made the final product - said the team had to ensure the new table was lightweight and simple to use.“[Mr Gardiner] was looking to bring some efficiency to theatre time and increase the number of surgeries able to be performed during the day,” he added.The Gardiner Hand Surgery System is being trialled in other hospitals across the UK.
