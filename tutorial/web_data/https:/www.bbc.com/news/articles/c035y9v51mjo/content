A 16-year-old boy has been found guilty of the manslaughter of a woman during a row after they both inhaled laughing gas on Christmas Eve.The youth had a physical fight with Kacey Clarke, 22, and then stabbed her in the chest at a flat in Bermondsey, south-east London.Earlier that evening he was caught on CCTV threatening to “ching her up" and kill her, the Old Bailey heard.Both Ms Clarke and her killer had a history of inhaling nitrous oxide – commonly known as laughing gas – which was classified a class C drug in November 2023. The boy, who cannot be named because of his age, will be sentenced at a later date.
After the killing, the teenager hid the weapon – a large knife – in a railway arch where it was discovered by a Thames Water workman.The court heard he had a history of possessing knives, having previously been caught with a 25cm long Rambo-style blade in an ice cream shop and a lock-knife in his waistband in a residential area.Giving evidence, the boy admitted he had taken laughing gas and claimed he had acted in self-defence by waving a knife to create an “invisible shield”.He said he could not remember a moment of impact when the knife went into Ms Clarke's chest.He was convicted of manslaughter after being cleared of the more serious charge of murder.
