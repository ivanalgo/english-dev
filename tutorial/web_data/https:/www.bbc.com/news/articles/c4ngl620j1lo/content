A five-year-old boy has left his home for the first time in six months following a successful transplant using stem cells that were donated in 2008.When Gunner, from Shropshire, was 17 months old he was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder which stops his body breaking down sugar.A previous transplant had failed, but he has now received a successful transplant using cells from the blood from a baby's umbilical cord.His mum Holly said: "Gunner's cheeky personality is coming right back."
"So far, we have ventured to the park, skate park, dog walking, school runs for his big sister and out to feed the ducks," she said.The stem cells used were frozen with liquid nitrogen vapour at -150C until a match was found.Following the transplant in January, Gunner had to isolate for six months to give his immune system time to produce enough white blood cells to fight infection.
Gunner has mucopolysaccharidosis type I hurler syndrome, a rare inherited condition that prevents the breakdown of certain sugars in the body.The build-up of sugars can cause problems with physical and mental development.Gunner's symptoms first showed up when his belly button was pushed out, which was due to sugars building up in his liver and spleen.His parents were told Gunner would only live for about one or two years."We are eternally grateful to the incredible mother who donated their baby's umbilical cord," Holly added."The new white blood cells from the donor will hopefully make the enzyme he lacked which breaks down sugar."The family are now backing NHS Blood and Transplant's appeal for more people to register as stem cell donors.
