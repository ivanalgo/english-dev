Bristol Rovers Football Club is consulting residents about new plans to build student flats next to the Memorial Stadium. The proposals include creating accommodation for 350 students in a six-storey building adjacent to the stadium. The east and north stands would also be upgraded, increasing the stadium's capacity from 12,534 to about 17,000.Chairman, Hussain AlSaeed, said: “Honesty and transparency with our supporters and neighbours is a critical aspect of this journey as we look to improve the infrastructure of the Memorial Stadium and our training ground.
Two meetings have been held with residents to discuss the plans but an application has not been submitted to Bristol City Council, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. “We are committed to developing our stadium into a vibrant, welcoming ground for fans of all ages, backgrounds and walks of life," said Mr AlSaeed.“I hope those in attendance during the meetings felt they were able to share their thoughts and opinions in an open conversation and understand that this round of meetings was a first step in an ongoing process.”
In 2023 the club began building a new south stand without first getting planning permission which caused controversy among people living nearby.Retrospective permission was later granted by councillors.Rovers had previously been planning to move to a new ground at the Fruit Market in St Philips, but this was called off. Green councillor Emma Edwards, representing Bishopston and Ashley Down, said: "We are pleased to see that they [the club] are keen to get input from residents before developing these plans further.“Since the development of the south stand last year, we have been listening to residents’ concerns and have been working hard to improve the way in which the club engages with the community."
