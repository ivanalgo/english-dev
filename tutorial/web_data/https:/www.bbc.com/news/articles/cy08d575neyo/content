A man who killed a “popular" barman who had become a father shortly before his death has been jailed.George Fenlon suffered serious head injuries when he was attacked by Rhys Jones on The Strand, Blackpool, on 15 August 2023.The 23-year-old did not regain consciousness and died three months later in hospital – having become a father a fortnight before his death, police said.Jones, 27, of Hampton Street in Cannock, Staffordshire, was jailed for 10 years and two months after pleading guilty to manslaughter at Preston Crown Court.
Lancashire Police said Jones had been in Blackpool as a holidaymaker when he attacked Mr Fenlon near the Trilogy nightclub.Mr Fenlon’s partner Bethany Turner said their daughter Clara, who was born in November, was given the middle name Georgia after her father.
In a victim impact statement, she said: “Within just four hours of her coming into the world, she was able to meet her daddy.“She laid under his arm for a little while, so content and peacefully, she fitted perfectly in the nook of his arm."But Ms Turner said “the world changed for me in one phone call” on hearing of the attack, adding: “The majority of my pregnancy was bittersweet.”“Two weeks was all the time Clara got with her daddy. Two weeks which were spent getting as many pictures and keepsakes as we all could."
Mr Fenlon’s mother said in her statement: “George was always known by all who knew him as a gentle, loving and kind young man.She described him as “a popular barman, well known in Blackpool - he loved his job and was well known for his demonstrations of cocktail making”.She added: “George could have been the most amazing and perfect dad. He would have been the kind of dad every girl should have.”Det Insp Steve Hallam said: "My thoughts continue to be with George's family and loved ones."The assault by Rhys Jones left George with terrible injuries and in a coma, which meant he was unable to see his baby daughter when she was born."This case highlights what devastating consequences assaults of this nature can have."
