A public consultation has been launched on plans to cut library opening hours in Bradford - the latest in a series of cost-cutting measures.Bradford Council wants to save £175,000 on its public library running costs next year, and is seeking views on proposals to reduce opening hours by about 15%.The service has already been stripped back in recent years, despite concerns from campaigners and workers, with volunteers now running the majority of formerly council-managed public libraries.Councillor Sarah Ferriby said the authority did not want to make cuts but faced "difficult decisions" as it sought to make savings.
A union last week warned of a risk of redundancies if the library budget was cut, with the council saying it would look to "minimise staff redundancies wherever possible".In its consultation, the council says its previous changes to opening hours were based on "usage data" and refocusing resources at the busiest times.The council said its "challenging financial situation" had triggered this latest review which would allow for savings to be made "without needing to close any libraries".The district's busiest City Library would not be affected by the current proposals, the council said.But two options are given for each of the other nine libraries, with an average reduction of six hours per week.Proposals include closing for one hour at lunchtime each day, or a combination of one half-day closure and closing earlier on Saturdays.Another proposal would see the council ending its policy of providing national newspapers in libraries, which could save £11,000 each year.The authority previously reassured the public that the volunteer-run libraries in the district, as well as "hybrid" libraries that are run by a mix of council staff and volunteers, would not be affected.Ms Ferriby, executive member for healthy people and places, said: “This consultation will allow us to make informed decisions based on the information that our residents provide who use our libraries services.“I would encourage everyone of all ages to have their say on what they would like to see happen with opening hours at their local library.”Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
