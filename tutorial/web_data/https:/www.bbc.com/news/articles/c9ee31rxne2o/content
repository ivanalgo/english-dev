A drug dealer was cleared of murdering a teenager after prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to put him on trial, the BBC can reveal.Ashton Rowbotham, 19, died from a stab wound at a tower block in Grays, Essex, in October.Connor Knight was charged with his murder but the prosecution was dropped last month.The 21-year-old defendant was instead convicted of drug offences and was jailed on Wednesday for two years and six months.
A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman said the "evidential material" was "carefully considered".“After a full review with senior lawyers and prosecution counsel it was concluded that there was not enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and the proceedings were stopped," she said.“Our thoughts remain with the family [of Mr Rowbotham] and we will offer to meet with them so a full explanation can be provided.”
Essex Police said it attended George Crooks House at about 03:40 BST on 6 October.The tower is on the Seabrooke Rise estate, off New Road.Police described the incident as a "disturbance" and a post-mortem examination concluded the victim died from a stab wound to the neck.In a short statement released at the time, Mr Rowbotham's family said: "Our heart is breaking. You are loved so much. You will always be with us."Knight had already pleaded not guilty to murder but the charge was withdrawn on 10 May - a month before his trial was due to begin.However, police said searches of the defendant's address at the time revealed he had a "large amount" of cocaine and cannabis.At Basildon Crown Court, Knight, of New Road, Grays, admitted one count of possession with intent to supply a controlled Class A drug and one count of intent to supply a controlled Class B drug.Police said he was also in possession of an "offensive weapon".Four other people have also been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary - in connection with the incident in October - and released under investigation.
A file has been prepared for the coroner over Mr Rowbotham's death.The circumstances are expected to be discussed in an inquest at the Essex coroner's court at a later date.
