Retrospective plans to keep a contentious outdoor seating platform at a Lake District hotel are likely to be approved.The Lakes Parish Council (LPC) raised concerns over the seating arrangements at the Fisherbeck Hotel in Ambleside and its potential for noise and light pollution. However, planning officers do not believe the platform has caused increased disturbance in the area.The Lake District National Park Authority is expected to allow the hotel to keep the area as it is.
In an objection to an application for retrospective planning permission, the LPC claimed the retention of the outdoor seating would "bring further harm to residents".It said the area operated like a bar, overlooked neighbouring properties and was not in keeping with its surroundings.The letter of objection said signage was "undoubtedly not dark skies-friendly", adding: â€œThe operational development consisting of a first-floor bar is visually intrusive and appears incongruous in the conservation area of Ambleside."
In a statement seen by the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the applicant said the Covid-19 pandemic had highlighted the lack of outdoor space at the Fisherbeck, which "threatened the sustainability of future bookings".It added that the seating area had been built to a high standard.In their report to the development control committee for the Lake District National Park Authority, a planning officer highlighted the location of the site, which is close to commercial and residential properties and within the proximity of the busy A591.The officer added that they did not consider that the seating area had "resulted in an increased level of disturbance beyond what might be considered as normal for a longstanding use of this nature".The plans will be discussed by the committee on 7 February.
