A decision on approving a new Aldi supermarket has been postponed after one councillor described the design as "ugly".The German chain wants to demolish a former car showroom in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and build a two-storey shop.Buckinghamshire Council's planning committee voted to defer the application after a discussion that lasted nearly two hours.Elements of the plans which may now be revised include site deliveries, the external appearance of the building, and a right-hand turning lane into the site.
The Local Democracy Reporting Service said some objectors questioned the need for another supermarket, given there is a Tesco superstore in Old Amersham and a Little Waitrose and M&S Simply Food in the town centre.However, John Catton, vice-chairman of the Amersham Society, a conservation and heritage group with 350 members, argued the town needed a new budget supermarket.He said the one proviso the society had was that Aldi’s proposed "blocky" building for London Road West should be more sympathetic to the area.Tesco has said the project would harm nearby Grade II listed buildings.Mike Stannard, a Conservative councillor, said he supported Aldi’s plans as "good for Amersham", but said the design of the building was "absolutely ugly".
More than 1,500 letters of support for the store had been received by the Conservative-controlled council, with only a couple dozen objections.Blueprints have shown there would be 101 parking spaces at the site.Another Conservative councillor, Isobel Darby, added she was "really concerned" about the number and size of the parking spaces planned.She said the large cars of Amersham and local preferences for driving rather than walking meant that the planned parking provision would not be adequate.Highways officer Lucy Malloy told the meeting that the Buckinghamshire county-wide parking guidance means Aldi’s planned spaces were 30cm (11in) too narrow, only measuring 2.5m by 5m (8ft by 16ft).However she explained that this was considered acceptable due to parking requirements being updated around the time the planning application was made.
