A former department store has been bought by a council as part of plans to transform a town centre. The proposals for Stockton and north Thornaby include the redevelopment of the former Debenhams building in Stockton, up to 2,000 new homes and a transport hub at Thornaby Station. The Splash leisure centre will also be upgraded and refurbished as part of a 25-year blueprint approved by Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council.  Nigel Cooke, cabinet member for housing and regeneration, said: "This is a long-term vision and there’s a good chance I won’t be around to see it, but there’s some things that are soon within reach."
In the new plan, Stockton Council says it is committed to redeveloping the former Debenhams site which it describes as a "significant, historic building" which needs preserving for generations to come. The plans also include upgrading a shopping arcade, The Shambles, and converting Stockton Town Hall into a register office.The Castlegate Quay could be developed into a cultural heritage quarter celebrating the famous first passenger railway, which might include a floating restaurant. Mr Cooke said: "What we see on those plans is this golden nugget, the river, the golden thread that runs right through it. We’re making the most of that and we’re now linking both sides of the river."
The plans also include improvements to the "much loved" Thornaby Station with a new transport gateway, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.Mr Cooke added: "Even now, you can get trains to almost anywhere in the country from Thornaby but in terms of its design and capacity and some of the restrictions around there, it does needs improving."
