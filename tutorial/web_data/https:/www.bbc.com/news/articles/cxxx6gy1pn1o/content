"Following a review of our winter programme, we've made the difficult decision to stop running our Winter Lights event at Anglesey Abbey," the trust said in a Facebook post."For 12 years, our staff and volunteers have enjoyed putting on this nature-inspired evening event that we know is a highlight in many people's festive calendars. "We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our visitors who have come along to support us."We understand that this will come as a disappointment for many, but we feel that we've reached a natural point where we now need to channel our energy into new and exciting opportunities to showcase the wonderful gardens and house in our care at Anglesey Abbey."
In December, visitors described "wasted journeys" and "crying children" after the event was cancelled.Anglesey Abbey called off the event, on a Saturday shortly before Christmas, due to waterlogged car parks and a forecast of strong winds.A Facebook post was published, but ticket-holders were not contacted directly, so many still travelled.Anglesey Abbey said it was "sorry to all those who were inconvenienced".
