A bid for further devolution would "unleash the potential" of Cornwall, a council has said. Cornwall Council's White Paper, outlining its desire for additional powers, includes calls for a five-year Cornwall Wealth Fund - worth £133m annually.It has also asked for more control over public transport, adult education and providing affordable housing. The authority said final proposals would be submitted to the government in September - to give time for all members to be consulted.
The council document claims the proposals would make Cornwall less financially dependent on the government, and help generate an extra £5.2bn a year towards the UK economy.It argued Cornwall has the potential to help contribute towards a "green revolution," including floating offshore wind and mining lithium for electric vehicles' batteries.Cornwall agreed two devolution deals with the previous Conservative government, and the council said its White Paper was a "significant step" towards advanced powers.
Other proposals in the White Paper include:
The Liberal Democrat group on the council argued for the plan to be more ambitious, including management of major roads like the A30 and A38.The Mebyon Kernow/Green group suggested Cornwall's newly elected MPs should be asked for their input too - which the cabinet agreed to.The government invited local authorities to submit plans to devolve more powers to "sensible economic geographies".Councillor Linda Taylor, the Conservative leader of Cornwall Council said: "Cornwall has the ability and should be determining its own future."Heaven forbid we get lumped into an even bigger area. We don't want and don't deserve it and we will be fighting for devolution for Cornwall in its own right." The White Paper had been due to be submitted before the end of July, but Labour and Independent councillors argued for more time to be able to scrutinise it. The cabinet agreed to push back the deadline to September, with an agreement on further devolution with the government by the end of the year.
