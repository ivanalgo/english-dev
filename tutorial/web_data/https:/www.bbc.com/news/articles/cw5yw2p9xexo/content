A newly elected Lincolnshire MP has used his maiden speech in parliament to criticise the impact of immigration on a town centre in his constituency.Richard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform UK, overturned a 25,000 Conservative majority to be elected as the MP for Boston and Skegness.He accused the previous government of allowing "mass immigration" which has had "significant consequences" in Boston and other parts of the country.The comments led to mutters of discontent from the benches with Gainsborough MP and deputy speaker Sir Edward Leigh reminding MPs to "keep quiet".
Mr Tice said: "They (immigrants) are not integrating and learning the language and, regrettably, it has an intimidating atmosphere in the centre of the town."The implication is most seriously felt by women and constituents who donâ€™t want to go into the centre of this great market town at night because of fears that, frankly, it is not safe."I have been on a number of occasions. What you will see is drug dealers plying their hideous, vile trade night in, night out. This is completely unacceptable."Mr Tice also described "dozens and dozens of Eastern Europeans" arriving in the town and said the EU settlement scheme had allowed "mass, uncontrolled immigration".The comments attracted some calls of "rubbish" and muttering from other MPs, at which point Sir Edward Leigh, who was acting as speaker, intervened.He said: "During a maiden speech everyone keeps very quiet. Whatever you think of what's being said, keep quiet."In addition to his comments on immigration, Mr Tice also spoke out on "stupid" net zero targets and described plans to build solar farms on farmland as "idiocy".He also paid tribute to his predecessor, Matt Warman, for his work in improving healthcare in the area and for saving a children's unit from closure.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
