A new opera described as a "Victorian romcom" has been premiered.Under the Greenwood Tree, based on Thomas Hardy's novel, was performed as part of Dorset Opera Festival, which celebrated its 50th anniversary.The show took place at Bryanston School's theatre in Blandford Forum.Director and composer Paul Carr called the story "a classic love at first sight, it's so delicious."
He added that Hardy's piece is a "romantic tale" set in the 1840s in a fictional Dorset village called Mellstock.Mr Carr said he wanted to stage an opera that was full of "optimism"."I wanted people to leave the theatre all feeling like they've just fallen in love again," he said.Mr Carr was asked to write an opera for the festival 10 years ago but was reluctant, "I didn't want to be one of those people that failed".He said now he is in his 60s and his mindset has changed, he thought: "So what, if it's a flop, if it fails, then I've had a good innings."
Lead soprano Jamie Groote played Fancy Day.The Canadian singer said performing a new opera has given the cast the opportunity to "explore and play" with their roles far more than they would if it was an already established title.Lead baritone Felix Kemp, from Kent, played Dick Dewey and said it was special to work collaboratively with Mr Carr and to have an opera written to fit the voices of the singers.The opera was performed in English, which Ms Groote said gave the piece a sense of "immediacy", allowing the audience to engage with the story more easily.
Founded in 1974 in Sherborne, Dorset Opera moved to Bryanston and became a fully-fledged festival in 2011, with a remit to present at least two major-opera productions each summer.Under the Greenwood Tree is to be shown on Thursday at 19:00 BST and on the final day of the festival on Saturday at 14:00.
