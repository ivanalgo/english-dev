England footballer John Stones has dedicated the Three Lions' victory over Slovakia to a "special little boy" who died during the match, aged five. Dillan Ramsey, who was diagnosed with leukaemia as a one-year-old, passed away peacefully, his family said. His mum, Amy, from Manchester, said he had left "an army of broken hearts" after four years of treatments. Stones, who previously shared the family's appeal for a bone marrow donor, said Dillan was an "inspiration to us all". 
"Tonight was for Dillan," the Manchester City defender posted on Instagram after the 2-1 Euro 2024 knockout match."Rest in peace little fighter, our thoughts are with his family during this unimaginably difficult time."Ms Ramsey said Dillan "was still talking and making us laugh until he took his last breath", as she announced his death on social media."You are not in pain anymore Dilly my gorgeous boy," she added. 
Dillan was first diagnosed in 2020 during the Covid-19 lockdown after his mum noticed him limping and took him to hospital. Blood tests later revealed he had the cancer, and he underwent years of chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant, and further treatment in the US.In February, Ms Ramsey said test results had showed cancer, with the family being told to "enjoy this time" as there was no treatment.  Ms Ramsey said the family had "poured every penny" of their savings into Dillan's care, adding they had "lost everything from fighting for so long".An online fundraiser to support his family has raised more than £650,000. She thanked people for their "continued support, love and condolence, it means the world to us and we are so grateful to you all".
