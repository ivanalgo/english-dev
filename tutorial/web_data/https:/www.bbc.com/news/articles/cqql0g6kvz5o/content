A decision to approve an oilfield in the Lincolnshire Wolds has been quashed following a Supreme Court judgment, lawyers have said.Campaigners from SOS Biscathorpe had brought the claim against the government after it approved plans for exploratory oil drilling and production last year.Legal representatives for the campaigners said, prior to the general election, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities had conceded the case.The developer, Egdon Resources, said it intended to "consider the outcome carefully before deciding the next steps with the project".
The Lincolnshire Wolds is a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.Lincolnshire County Council originally refused permission for the site but, in 2023, the Planning Inspectorate overturned the decision saying it was in the "public interest".Amanda Suddaby, from SOS Biscathorpe, said their group was "delighted that 10 years of hard-work and campaigning have finally paid off".She added: "Our hope now is that this paves the way to a full and proper understanding of the great harm that each and every new fossil fuel development represents."In June, justices at the Supreme Court said emissions created by burning fossil fuels should be considered when granting planning permission for new drilling sites.Solicitor Julia Eriksen, who represents the campaigners, said: "We hope this success in Lincolnshire is a positive sign for similar cases still before the courts."Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
