A second police force has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) following the deaths of a man and a woman in Staffordshire.South Wales Police said it had made the referral due to previous contact, following a similar announcement from Staffordshire Police on Wednesday.It follows the deaths of paramedic Daniel Duffield from Cannock and student nurse Lauren Evans, of Bridgend, at an address in Hednesford earlier in the week.Neither force revealed the nature of the contact.
The deaths are being investigated by Staffordshire Police, who issued a statement on Friday stating they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.Officers were called to an address on Alpine Drive in Hednesford by ambulance staff at about 12:30 BST on Tuesday, according to police.There they discovered Ms Evans, 22, and Mr Duffield, who was 24.Det Supt Nicki Addison, said: “This incident has understandably devastated the families and loved ones of those involved.“We’d like to reiterate that the families have asked for their privacy to be respected at this tragic time. Please respect that.”She added that speculation about what had happened was unhelpful and hurtful to the families, and warned it could hinder the police investigation.
