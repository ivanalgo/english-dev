The perpetrators of said abuse were fans of football clubs playing a friendly at Murrayfield Stadium - and police were standing 50 yards away."The statement which tagged in Police Scotland added: "Two sets of officers did absolutely nothing to prevent or stop any of the events from taking place - and in fact flat our refused to help when pressed by players."It's incredibly sad and desperate that we still have to deal with instances like this."The club said it was drafting a complaint to Police Scotland and other relevant authorities.It added: "We have worked tirelessly to make Roseburn Park a welcoming, all-inclusive venue for cricket - but days like today harm that irreparably - especially when those who can help refuse."
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: "Officers are carrying out inquiries after reports of abuse being directed towards players during a cricket match at Roseburn Park, Edinburgh on Saturday, 20 July 2024."Phil Yelland, Murrayfield DAFS president, said football fans attending the friendly had behaved in a "totally unacceptable way".In a post on the club's Facebook page, he said: "Players playing any sport in a public space should be able to do so without fear of violence and without homophobic and racial abuse and other anti social behaviour."One of our players has made a report to the police which is being followed through. Those involved in organising the event at Murrayfield have been contacted and a range of concerns expressed. Those involved in the local community have been alerted."He also apologised to Stewart's Melville, who the BBC has contacted for comment.
A local resident, who asked to remain anonymous, said Scottish Rugby was a “very bad neighbour”.She said: “They don’t really give anything back to the community but they create huge problems for us on match days and now it's much more than match days.“It’s big events like Taylor Swift. They see their stadium as something to make money out of at the expense of the park, local communities and parking.”A Scottish Rugby spokesman said: “We have worked hard in the past year to put improved communications, including a residents’ hotline and dedicated email address, in place to ensure a good flow of information for people living close to the stadium."We frequently receive very positive feedback from local residents for the steps being taken, who appreciate the information being shared."Our responsibility is to ensure all events run safely, for both spectators and those in the community and we hold regular open-invite residents’ meetings where relevant matters are discussed."He added that annually the stadium generated millions of pounds for the wider local economy, including employing hundreds of people on an event day.Cammy Day, the leader of City of Edinburgh Council, said: “As with all major events which take place in and around the city a detailed debrief meeting will take place."We can’t comment further on this specific incident while a police investigation is ongoing.”
