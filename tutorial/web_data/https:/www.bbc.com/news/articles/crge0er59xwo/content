A "major feature film" is being shot in Cheddar Gorge, sparking a temporary road closure.The B3135 is shut to vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians for four days, from Monday until Friday at 23:59 BST.There are rumours that director Danny Boyleâ€™s new zombie movie, 28 Years Later, is being filmed, but the production company and council have remained tight-lipped.Mark Ford, based at Screen Somerset, said: "With a massive production company in the area, it will bring money into the local economy and more interest in the area."
Somerset Council, which runs Screen Somerset, said access to businesses and Gorge attractions will not be affected during the closure.Mr Ford told BBC Radio Somerset it was for a "major feature film"."The director loved the Gorge and wanted to film a few scenes here."We've tried to limit disruption with most of the car parks still open and the loop Gorge walk is open so it's very much business as usual."It's just if you want to drive through the Gorge road onto the Mendips you won't be able to until after Friday 26th July," he said.
Some locals have voiced concerns about the closure being disruptive during the school summer holidays.Jesse Moore and George Love are rock climbers from near Bath and said it was 'very inconvenient'.Mr Moore said: "It seems unfair they can shut down a natural landscape for some filming during the summer."But, I suppose it will be nice to see our local crag on the big screen."
