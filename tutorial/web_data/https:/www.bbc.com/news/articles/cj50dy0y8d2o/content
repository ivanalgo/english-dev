Police are investigating reports of quad bikes being ridden dangerously in central Birmingham in the early hours of Saturday.Videos circulated on social media show a group of riders circling traffic near the Arcadian Centre on Hurst Street just after 01:00 BST, mounting pavements and running red lights.Officers are reviewing footage and conducting inquiries to identify those involved."This sort of behaviour is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated on the streets of our city," said Ch Insp Rich Evans of West Midlands Police.
"It is both dangerous for those on the roads and pavements as well as being disruptive and unpleasant for anyone in the area to have to endure," he added.The force said specialist traffic officers with powers to seize and crush vehicles would carry out extra patrols in the area.Officers are also working with Southside BID to tackle the issue.Investigators are keen to hear from anyone with CCTV, mobile or dashcam footage."If you think you know who these riders may be, please get in contact," Mr Evans said.
