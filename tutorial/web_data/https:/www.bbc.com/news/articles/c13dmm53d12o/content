An internationally renowned comic book artist has donated original artwork to his former school to help inspire pupils.Brian Bolland worked on Batman, Judge Dredd and dozens of other DC Comic titles.Mr Bolland was brought up in Butterwick, near Boston, and studied at Boston Grammar School in the 1960s.He was described as "inspirational" by students who watched him create sketches of Batman villains. 
Brian Bolland illustrated Batman: The Killing Joke written by Alan Moore, which has not been out of publication since the 1980s. It revealed the origins of Batman's nemesis The Joker, which influenced film versions played by Jack Nicholson and Health Ledger.In his visit to Boston Grammar School he spoke to students about some of his work, admired their art and drew original pictures for the school to display.Despite moving away from the market town he said he still "considers it home" and is "very fond the place."He was taken on a tour of the school after being a guest of honour at the school's annual alumni dinner organised by the Old Bostonian Association.Art teacher Luke Morris said the meeting was "inspirational for the students", and "fascinating to watch a professional working"."To be able to look at an array of first class, internationally recognised comic art and have the creator sat with my students talking to them is just amazing," he added.The teenage students also enjoyed the visit, one described his artistry as "wild", another said a "rare occasion" to have such a renowned artist in their midst and another said it was "impressive" to see Mr Bolland at work.
