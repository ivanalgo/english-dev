Pub-goers have been rallying to save two cats after the venue was ordered by its owners to remove them.Malt and Hops have been at The Wellington in Birmingham for five years but owner Black Country Ales has said they have to go. It has not been confirmed why the brewery wanted the cats removed but the firm has come under fire from customers on social media, with one describing it as a “disgrace” and another as “ridiculous”.Black Country Ales said it would not be providing a comment.
In a flyer shared on social media, the pub said the felines were “adored by staff and customers alike”.“As a pub, we are heartbroken at the idea of removing the cats from their home and will be doing everything within our power to keep them where they belong,” the flyer added.The pub urged customers to “spread the word” by posting positive reviews mentioning the cats online and by contacting the brewery directly to show them “how important Hops and Malt are”.
Posting the flyer on Facebook, one man said: “The Wellington is a gem of a pub and the pub cats, Malt and Hops, always make a visit even more enjoyable.“Not sure why anyone would be so heartless as to turf them out after five years.”In a response to the post, one person described the cats as “adorable” and “part of the furniture”.
