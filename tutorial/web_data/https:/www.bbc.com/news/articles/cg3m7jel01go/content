A bald dog taken in by the RSPCA is struggling to find a new home due to his unusual skin allergy.Patch, who is thought to be a boxer breed, has no fur due to a severe reaction to dust mites and birch pollen, with his previous owners giving him up after being unable to afford treatments.It took staff at the charity's Halifax, Huddersfield, Bradford and District Branch more than six months to work out what was causing Patch's soreness and balding.Staff said the four-year-old dog was a "wonderful boy with so much love to give".  
Patch now has a treatment plan in place which involves not only sun cream but medicated baths and allergy tablets.Fay Gibbons, from the branch, said: “Taking on any dog is a huge responsibility and a big financial commitment, but Patch’s new owners will need to be aware of the added costs of managing his allergies. "His care plan can change from season to season and will depend on how his condition improves with time - but our team will help any potential adopters with this."Patch has his own wardrobe of special jumpers to wear during colder weather to keep him warm.He is house trained, but can't live with other dogs or cats and the perfect home would be adult-only.Ms Gibbons added: “Patch loves the company of people so he’d like someone who is based at home and has lots of time to spend with him."He is one of the goofiest dogs we’ve ever had; he’s always getting up to cheeky antics and making us all giggle!"Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
