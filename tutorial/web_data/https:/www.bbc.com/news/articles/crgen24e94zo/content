Inspectors have found "significant concerns" in services for children with special needs in West Northamptonshire.Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission said there were "widespread and systemic failings" in the service.Their report outlined areas that need to be urgently improved for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).The partnership which runs the service said it accepts the findings and "apologises to children, young people and their families where we have fallen short".
Services for children with SEND in West Northamptonshire are provided by a partnership of the local council and the NHS Integrated Care Board.The report of the inspection, carried out in March, said the failings identified "must be addressed urgently".It said: "Children and young people with SEND have not been prioritised for education, health and social care provision."
Inspectors found children "wait too long for their needs to be assessed and for suitable provision to be put in place to meet their needs".They also said that waits for services such as speech and language therapy, mental health services and neuro-developmental assessment were "too long".The inspectors said "those who 'shout the loudest' get the help they need" which had led to an increase in complaints.Their report was also critical of the area's education, health and care (EHC) plans, saying they "are not completed in a timely manner" and their accuracy is "poor".
In response, the partnership highlighted the "green shoots" of improvement found by the inspectors.Fiona Baker, cabinet member for West Northamptonshire Council, said there was ongoing work "to address the concerns arising from complaints and feedback from our service users".She said there was an improvement plan in place.It includes improving the timeliness and quality of EHC needs assessments and speeding up access to speech and language therapy and mental health services.A similarly critical report into SEND provision by North Northamptonshire Council was published earlier this year.
