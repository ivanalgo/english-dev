A former industrial town in Cornwall has been successfully regenerated, a recent report has found.Redruth has been the subject of a four-year programme costing £6m to revitalise five key historic sites and the high street.Rose Regeneration, an economic development company, reported the High Street Heritage Action Zone (HSHAZ) project had delivered a social return on investment of £2.68 for each £1 invested.Social return on investment measures the value created by social, environmental and economic activities.
The report found the benefit cost ratio, the relationship between the relative costs and benefits, of the HSHAZ project was 3.78 which it said showed high value for money when matched to government benchmarks.The programme was funded with £4.4m secured by Cornwall Council and local partners and £1.6m from Historic England.Rebecca Barrett of Historic England, said: "From imaginative cultural events that have helped to animate the high street, to the repurposing of handsome historic buildings that tell the story of Redruth’s industrial past to provide new community and commercial uses – it’s been a success from start to finish."
Five historic sites in the town have been revitalised.
