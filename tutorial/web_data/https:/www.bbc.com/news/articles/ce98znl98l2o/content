PCs Alannah Mulhall and Joseph Gerrard were responding to a call at Leicester Square where a man had been arrested for spiking and a victim was being cared for.PC Mulhall along with her colleague heard a commotion on the street and went to investigate. At this point they were confronted by a man armed with a knife who stabbed PC Mulhall through her arm – the wound was so deep it almost went through the other side.Despite the serious injury, she remained calm and was able to call for backup.On their arrival, the man was still armed and multiple attempts to detain him failed as Taser, PAVA spray and baton strikes could not subdue him.She and her colleagues including PC Gerrard, stood their ground and ensured the crowd stayed safely away from the attacker who then lunged at and stabbed PC Gerrard five times.He was left with wounds to his neck and arm, and his lung was also punctured.
