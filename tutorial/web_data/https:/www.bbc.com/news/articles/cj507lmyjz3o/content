A decision on a controversial waste to energy incinerator is expected once Parliament returns from its summer break in September.The Â£150m energy recovery facility in Portland, Dorset, has been the centre of a public inquiry after it was refused by Dorset Council, prompting an appeal to the Planning Inspectorate by developers Portland Powerfuel.An outcome from the inquiry, held in the run up to Christmas 2023, had initially been expected in January but was delayed. Since then the government has announced a consultation into waste to energy plants, which is due to end in early August.
A different consultation by the Environment Agency over whether or not it should grant an environmental operating permit to the incinerator business sparked rumours that a decision had been made.But a spokesman for the agency said the consultation was not linked to the Planning Inspectorate decision.
"The public inquiry is a separate issue, and is as a result of Dorset Council refusing planning permission for the incinerator," he said."Planning permission and environmental permits are considered entirely independently of each other, but both are needed in order for the facility to operate."The spokesman added that environmental permit decisions looked at "different issues" to those local authorities consider when looking at planning permission.Ward councillors Paul Kimber and Rob Hughes both said there were surprised by the Environment Agency consultation.A decision has not been made in the inquiry, but a spokesman for the Planning Inspectorate said the report was now with the new secretary of state.Whatever the outcome, there will be a short period following the announcement when the decision can be legally challenged.Powerfuel did not respond to an invitation to comment on the latest consultation.
