Detectives investigating disorder in a Leeds suburb which saw a police car flipped and a double-decker bus torched have identified 40 suspects.Two more men have been charged with offences related to the disturbance in Harehills and appeared at Leeds Magistrates' Court earlier.A West Yorkshire Police spokesperson said 17 people had been arrested in connection with the unrest on 18 July, when hundreds of people took to the streets.The force confirmed senior detectives were helping with the investigation and facial recognition technology, as well as reviewing social media videos shot on the night, was being used.
Assistant Ch Con Patrick Twiggs said arresting and bringing to justice those involved "remained a key focus for the force".Mark Mitchell, 43, of Strathmore View, Leeds, and Zamonsty Milan, 30, ofLuxor Avenue, Leeds, appeared before magistrates to face charges of arson reckless as to endanger life and violent disorder earlier.Another man appeared in court in the city on Monday charged with the same offences.Iustin Dobre, 37, of Clifton Mount, Harehills, was charged in connection with the destruction of a First bus which went up in flames.All three are due to appear at Leeds Crown Court on August 19.
Trouble began out on Thursday at about 17:00 BST after police officers attended an address in the suburb to assist social workers with a "child protection matter".That spilled into surrounding streets with people hitting a police car with sticks and throwing objects before turning the vehicle onto its side.A number of fires were lit, including the one which consumed the bus on nearby Foundry Approach.Other parties arrested have been released on police bail with conditions imposed to reduce the likelihood of further offending.  
Mr Twiggs added: “A dedicated investigation team was set up within hours of the disorder, with initial arrests taking place early on Friday morning and continuing over the weekend. We have promised residents that all necessary resources will be utilised to bring in all those believed to be involved, and our efforts will continue.“I want to thank residents in Harehills for their dignified response to the offending committed by a minority on Thursday night and Friday morning.“We continue to work with the communities of Harehills and have engaged in several community meetings since Thursday evening. These have been well-attended, allowing us to understand the strength of feeling in the community and support for police action."A portal was created for witnesses to share images and video footage of the disorder that could assist police.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
