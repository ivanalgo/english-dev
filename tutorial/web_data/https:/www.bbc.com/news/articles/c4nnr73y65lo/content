"We were celebrating our engagement - it should have been one of the best experiences that anyone should be able to have, where I proposed to my boyfriend and he is now my fiancée."We were walking down the road holding hands."It was at this point a homophobic slur was shouted."Before I knew it, I was being punched in the face and I fell to the floor."During the attack, their engagement ring was lost."I just wanted to get it back," said Mr Samuel, who works as a drag queen telling stories to children. "The police said my health and safety was their top priority, but as soon as I got to the hospital I left."I went back to near the McDonald's and I was just crying and searching on the ground for it."Eventually, they found the ring and then went back to hospital where scans showed they had a fractured jaw.  Mr Samuel, who is recovering at home, said this has made them more determined to go out and hold hands with their partner.
