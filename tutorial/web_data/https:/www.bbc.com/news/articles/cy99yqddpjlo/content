A school is fundraising to build a garden in memory of a former head teacher. Helen Fishbourne, who worked for Harvington C of E First and Nursery School in Worcestershire for 33 years, died earlier this year.The Evesham school is trying to raise £5,000 for the project - with more than £1,200 raised so far.Former students and colleagues paid tribute to the teacher on the project's crowdfunding page.
A statement from the school said Mrs Fishbourne died during the Easter half term holidays.It said: "Mrs Fishbourne was a part of the school for 33 years, she taught many children and had an important role in the community.  "One of her passions was music, she loved everything to do with music.  She was a keen brass player and encouraged children to learn instruments during their time at Harvington."Another of her passions was the outdoors. She would encourage staff to get the children outside to enjoy the beautiful school grounds as much as possible."Our vision is to combine these two passions to create a memorial garden for our children to use on the school grounds that has a music theme."
Tributes left on the page praised the idea. One person wrote: "Thank you for inspiring me. I’m proud and privileged to say you were my best teacher and inspiration. Sweet dreams Mrs F and thank you for your service.Another wrote: "Helen, you'll always be at the heart and soul of this school."
