A former sub-postmistress from Surrey wrongly jailed whilst pregnant in the Post Office IT scandal is to take part in a national show. Seema Misra from West Byfleet, Surrey, was sentenced in 2010 after an audit found a discrepancy in her accounts.She will be interviewed by journalist Nick Wallis, who consulted on ITV's Mr Bates vs The Post Office, as part of The Post Office Scandal: The Inside Story. The show comes to the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford on Wednesday. 
Ms Misra was one of more than 700 sub-postmasters and postmistresses prosecuted between 1999 and 2015 for theft and false accounting after a faulty computer system called Horizon made it look like money was missing from their branches.Her conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2021.
Ms Misra has previously told the BBC that she had suicidal thoughts during the ordeal, which she described as "so shameful".She will talk about her first-hand experience of the scandal as part of the show, which will be followed by a question and answer session. Mr Wallis, a former BBC Radio Surrey presenter, will also interview former Farncombe sub-postmaster Chirag Sidhpura.
