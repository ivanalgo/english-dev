"Multiple residents" across Medway are yet to receive their postal votes, according to the council. Its leader, Vince Maple, said people were "increasingly concerned" they will be unable to participate in the General Election on Thursday as a result.In a letter written to Royal Mail on Saturday, Mr Maple said one household whose postal votes were dispatched on 20 June was yet to receive them.Royal Mail said it had "investigated concerns" and that "all votes are being delivered".
Concerns about postal vote delays have been raised elsewhere, including in Scotland and south-east London. The Local Government Association, which said the number of people voting by post had risen by a fifth since the last election, has called for the "overburdened" system to be reviewed.Norma Baxter, 79, who lives in independent living accommodation in Twydall, said she had not received her postal vote."I'd liked to have a vote," she said. "I've always voted and my argument is it doesn't matter who I vote for, if I've voted then I've got a right to have a moan."A Medway Council spokesperson said that it sent postal votes first class and "on time".

"It is concerning to hear that some people might not have yet received their postal vote pack," they said.They added that replacement postal vote packs were available at the council offices at Gun Wharf in Chatham.Those who are unable to return postal votes in time can return them in person at a polling station in their constituency on polling day.A Royal Mail spokesperson said: â€œWe have a specialist elections team that plans every aspect of the elections delivery programmes and works closely with local authorities to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible."
