A Sussex man who fell over the promenade in Brighton has set his sights on competing in the 2028 Paralympics in Los Angeles.Noah Rees, from Peacehaven, was 18 when he broke his spine, skull and ribs, puncturing his lungs after falling 10m (32.8ft).The fall happened in May 2019 when he leaned on a railing which collapsed.Mr Rees told BBC South East: "It is hard to believe it is five years. I try not to think about that night too much."
The former rugby player also split his carotid artery (which supplies the brain with blood), severed his optic nerve, had a subdural haematoma and was left with brain injuries.He has had a long recovery but now trains "multiple times a week" to be able to take part in sports, such as discus.He believes he is a "better person, away from all the sports stuff" since the incident."People told me I canâ€™t do things but I can do it," he said."I have got to make the most of my new chance in life. I have changed position for myself."
His mother, Anna, said: "It was the night our lives completely changed. "I was shocked to see him lying there in a state but I never thought I would lose him, despite all the doctors telling me there was little chance of his survival."Despite eight weeks in coma and not being able to speak or swallow, he could still speak German. He is an exception to the rule, he is unique."She added she has never been back to the scene of the accident.Mr Rees said: "If I could go back in change things, I probably would. "My life was good and people liked me, but I prefer this person I am now."
