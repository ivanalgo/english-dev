A pony that was trapped in a four foot deep (1.2m) trench has been rescued by firefighters. Crews used hand tools to create space for Basil after he was found stuck in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday morning. Firefighters from Berkshire and Buckinghamshire said he had to be sedated, and strops and a crane were used to lift him to safety. Basil was left in the hands of his owner and the vet, the fire service added.
His owners said: "Basil has responded well to medication, started eating and remains stable. "I can't thank the fire service enough for their expertise, professionalism and empathy."
