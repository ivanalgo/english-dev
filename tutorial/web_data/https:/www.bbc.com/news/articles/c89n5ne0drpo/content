A new pro-life society at the University of Manchester has caused controversy with more than 15,000 people signing a petition calling for it to be dissolved.The student-organised petition criticised the university's decision to allow the society to be formed, claiming it added to an "already prevalent stigma" surrounding abortion.The students' union said it could not block a society forming because of their beliefs.The Manchester Pro-Life society said it existed to "promote the wellbeing, and dignity of every human life, from conception".It claimed it was "not an anti-abortion society but a pro-life society".The society was officially affiliated by Manchester Students' Union on 11 January before an Instagram post announced the committee on 9 February.Its committee consists of its president, George Vincent, a history of art student, and its treasurer, medical student Jacob Karinatan.A third student was also on the committee but had since removed their name from the society's Instagram post.
The petition calling for the society's dissolution claims its existence "adds to an already prevalent stigma surrounding abortion", believing women at the University of Manchester "should not have to face additional pressure or judgement on such personal matters".It said: "The student union should be a place that supports all students' rights and wellbeing rather than endorsing societies that aim to abolish these rights."On its webpage, the pro-life society said it aimed "to create a pro-life culture on campus and support the dignity of every human life from conception" and encourages students to join to "help promote life". In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for the society said: "We exist to encourage students to think critically about the way we define and value human life."While we oppose abortion, we are also concerned with other threats to life including assisted suicide, the death penalty, deaths occurring through poverty and poor living standards, structural issues in critical infrastructure such as the NHS, and climate change."
The Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023, which comes into full effect on 1st August, legislates on a university's duties when it comes to freedom of speech.It states students' union's have a duty to "promote the importance of" freedom of speech and academic expression.The legislation stipulates that students' union's "must take the steps that are reasonably practicable"  to secure compliance with the code of practice set out on the act.In a statement issued on their website, the University of Manchester Students' Union executive officers said: "We believe that fostering a culture of proactive involvement enables students to voice their opinions, challenge perspectives, and contribute to a diverse and inclusive campus environment.  "As a students’ union, operating as a charity, we must also ensure equitable access to resources, participation in activities, and the formation of groups for all members, irrespective of their lawful views. "As a result, diverse societies and students with conflicting perspectives coexist on campus."From a legal standpoint, it’s not possible to stop a society from affiliating for their legal views that are contrary to the views of other students. "That means, despite concerns over student safety, the students’ union can’t block a society from forming because of their beliefs."
