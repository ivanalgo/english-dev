A Guernsey primary school has been praised as "welcoming and inclusive" and commended for its "broad and balanced" curriculum by Ofsted.Vauvert Primary School in St Peter Port achieved a "good" rating, the second highest possible, in all areas in its latest inspection.The report noted some areas for improvement including more "specific" support for pupils with additional needs and "inconsistent" handwriting.Inspectors said overall pupils lived up to the school's "high expectations", behaved well, and benefited from an "impressive array" of extra-curricular activities such as Guernsey French, chess and stop frame animation.
Adrian Paul, headteacher, said he was "delighted" with the report, which he said recognised Vauvert was an "inclusive school with high expectations, that our curriculum is ambitious and that children achieve well".Mr Paul said the report was recognition of "the hard work put in by staff".The report also praised the way the school taught computing with children understanding concepts such as algorithms, step-by-step instructions computers follow, "because of the way this knowledge is carefully sequenced from reception year".The report noted areas for improvement including more "specific" support for pupils with additional needs and "inconsistent" handwriting across the school, especially among younger children.It said there was a "disconnect" in some subjects "between what children learn in the early years and how this links to the curriculum for the rest of the school".
Nick Hynes, the States' director of Education, said the report demonstrated that Guernsey's primary education system was "delivering good results".Mr Hynes said: "This inspection report is something the whole school community should be proud of."
