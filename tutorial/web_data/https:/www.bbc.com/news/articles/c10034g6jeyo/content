A city's famous row of red phone boxes is set for a long-awaited refurbishment designed to secure the future of a piece of telecommunications history.Eight of the nine kiosks in Preston city centre form what is the longest line of the calling facilities anywhere in the UK.The ninth on on Market Street stands on its own, a short distance from its record-breaking neighbours.They have all fallen into an increasing state of disrepair and have been vandalised since being disconnected around a decade ago.Preston City Council planning officials have given the green light to the refurbishment of the Grade II listed structures.  
The Local Democracy Reporting Service revealed last December, the phone boxes could be removed from their current site, alongside the former main post office building in order for restoration to be carried out.  The authority, which acquired the kiosks in 2021, said it was also considering engaging ways in which they could be put to use once back in situ.Options include working with local artists to create audio-visual installations.The works now approved by town hall planning officers will see the boxes stripped out, sandblasted with new toughened windowpanes installed and coloured lights and power sockets to facilitate any future displays within the tiny spaces.A condition has been attached to the planning permission to ensure that the renovated kiosks would be “well maintained in their new condition”.The report concluded that the works would “preserve” the listed structures – as required under legislation – and would not harm their significance.The eight boxes are all of the “K6” design by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, who was also responsible for the Cenotaph war memorial on Market Place and Liverpool Cathedral.
