Plans have been put forward to expand a special school for children with learning difficulties by bringing on board a soon-to-be empty school building.Pupils at Wilby Primary School near Wellingborough are being moved to the new Glenvale Park facility, which is due to open this year.The Rowan Gate school, which has four sites based across Northamptonshire, could take over the vacant Wilby site from September.The plan will be discussed at North Northamptonshire Council's executive meeting next week, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Rowan Gate Primary currently has four school sites, with its two main facilities on Finedon Road in Wellingborough and Hayway in Rushden.Two satellites based at Tennyson Road Infant School and Stanton Cross Primary School also help contribute to the county's special needs provision.
The school accommodates children with severe learning disabilities, autistic spectrum disorder, social, emotional and mental health needs and complex medical needs.Plans indicate the former Wilby school site would initially accommodate pupils in reception to Year 1, with a maximum capacity of 30 pupils.Should the proposals be approved by the executive next Thursday, refurbishments will be sought once the building has been vacated.
