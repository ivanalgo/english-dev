The life of ceramic artist Clarice Cliff has been celebrated with the unveiling of a national plaque.Cliff, who was born 125 years ago, is regarded as one of the most influential ceramic artists of the 20th Century. She started work at a pottery firm when she was just 13 before collaborating with celebrities to help market her works.To honour the artist, the blue plaque now sits at Cliff's former flat in Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent, where she lived at the height of her success.
Cliff is famous across the world for her colourful pottery that was developed in the 1920s and 30s, called "Bizarre-ware". From bright, bold colours to new shapes and patterns, her designs were seen as exciting and hyper-modern to buyers."Women today want continual change, they will have colour and plenty of it," she said in 1930.Relative Mark Cliff, who was at the unveiling of the plaque with his daughter, said it was a "momentous occasion and wonderful for what she had done for the area and for women."
The blue plaque tribute to Cliff is part of a national scheme run by Historic England that aims to highlight stories of inspirational people. Historic England chairman Lord Mendoza said: "We hope, by shining a light on Clarice Cliff and her story as a pioneer here in Stoke-on-Trent, that the blue plaque will inspire people, just as her own artistry and achievements continue to do so."
