The future of plans for a major housing project in Barnsley is to be decided by a government inspector after the proposals were rejected by the local authority.Developer Network Space said it wanted to build at least 200 homes on land near Shaw lane in Carlton.Barnsley Council rejected the project last year, saying there were environmental and safety concerns over the application.Network Space, who said they believe they have a "strong case" have appealed and a hearing by the planning inspectorate is due to be held in August.
Barnsley Council cited a range of issues for turning down the scheme, including what it said was a lack of infrastructure, as well as road safety concerns and insufficient water drainage at the site.It added that the applicants had not "adequately assessed the impact" of the development on Carlton Marsh, a nearby Site of Special Scientific Interest.
The application also fell short of achieving "the minimum housing density figures", the council said.More housing was an integral part of the authority's Carlton Masterplan which was approved in November 2021.As well as 1,500 new homes, the masterplan would see 210 more spaces at Carlton Primary School, a new shop and possibly also a new railway station.Meanwhile, a total of 32 letters objecting to the plans were submitted by members of the public, with concerns raised over traffic, lack of bus services and flooding, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.Network Space has asked the planning inspectorate – which has the power to overturn the council's decision – to investigate the refusal and to have the final say.“Whilst we were disappointed by the Council’s decision to refuse planning on a site allocated for residential development in the Local Plan, our legal and professional expert witness team believe we have a strong case and we look forward to presenting that to the Planning Inspector in due course," a spokesperson said.A hearing date for the appeal has been set for 6 August.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
