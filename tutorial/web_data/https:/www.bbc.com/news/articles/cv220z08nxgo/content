A stretch of a busy Leicestershire road is to be closed in the coming weeks as part of continuing work to build a bypass.Leicestershire County Council is currently constructing the north and east sections of the road around Melton Mowbray.It said part of Scalford Road, near John Ferneley College, will be closed from Monday 15 July to Sunday 25 August.Burton Road will also be closed between 1 July and 25 August.
The authority said the work, to create new roundabouts, had been planned during the school holidays to minimise disruption.The completed road will be a 4.4-mile (7km) route between the A606 Nottingham Road and the A606 Burton Road.The project is planned to relieve traffic congestion in the town centre and unlock land for new housing.In October, it was revealed the southern leg of the bypass was not viable due to spiralling costs.A council report said Â£27m of increased costs meant it could not afford the southern part of the road.Follow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
