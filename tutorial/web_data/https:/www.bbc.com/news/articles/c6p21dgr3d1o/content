Investment in a city centre road that runs directly outside a university campus has made the area “safer, more attractive and more accessible”, council leaders have said.East Park Terrace, in Southampton, recently reopened as a route just for buses, taxis and bicycles following improvement works.Southampton City Council said the scheme would improve bus journey times in and out of the city centre.The project involved upgrading crossings and installing intelligent traffic lights and additional cycle lanes.
It was funded by the Department for Transport’s Transforming Cities Fund.Cllr Eamonn Keogh, cabinet member for environment and transport, said: “It is about creating those sustainable travel options where people feel ‘yes, you know what I can leave my car at home because I have got better options to get around’.”
Council officers said the vehicle restriction for the road would see vehicle numbers along the stretch fall from 10,000 to 2,000 a day.CCTV will be used to monitor driver behaviour and, if a large number of private motor vehicles ignore the restrictions, enforcement cameras could be introduced, the council warned.The changes have been made near Southampton Solent University.Professor Sarah Jones, Solent University’s pro vice-chancellor for education, said the changes were "really exciting" and would provide the university with greater access to the community.“It is great to have that right on our doorstep and be able to open it now and see those connections forming,” she said.Cllr Keogh said the project was part of a wider scheme aiming to create a "liveable city", where people "feel they can that they can move around safely, accessibly and in attractive environment".
