A "severe bite" from a shark in East Florida on Friday has left a man in critical condition from blood loss, authorities said. The Nassau County Sheriff’s Office Marine Unit said they found the man on a boat. He was losing a lot of blood from a critical injury to his forearm. “Acting swiftly, a deputy boarded the vessel and applied a tourniquet to stop the bleeding,” the sheriff’s office said.An official then commandeered the watercraft and took the man to a boat ramp, where local fire rescue officials were waiting. The victim was airlifted to hospital and remains in critical condition, the sheriff's office said. He is expected to recover. The man was aboard a boat on the east coast of Florida when the shark attack occurred, officials said.The incident comes on the heels of two separate shark attacks that injured three swimmers in the Gulf Coast of Florida earlier in June. One of the women had part of her arm amputated after being bitten in Walton County in north-west Florida. Along with the amputation she suffered "critical injuries" to her hip, officials said. At another beach just miles away and on the same day, two teenage girls were attacked while in the water. One of the girls suffered "significant injuries to the upper leg and one hand" while the other had minor injuries on one of her feet, officials said.Shark attacks are more common in Florida than in most parts of the world. In 2023, Florida had 16 unprovoked shark bite incidents, according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File. That makes up 44% of the US total and 23% of the worldwide total. There were no fatalities from shark attacks last year in the state.There are around 70 to100 shark attacks every year worldwide, which kill about five people, according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File.
