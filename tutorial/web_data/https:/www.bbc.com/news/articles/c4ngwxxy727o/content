A pop-up exhibition featuring "vibrant and diverse" work by local artists is set to open on 13 July. Jersey Development Company (JDC) said the "extraordinary" display features over 30 talented artists within two ground floor commercial units at Horizon, St Helier Waterfront. Renowned local artist Ian Rolls said he brought the collective together to "exhibit a stunning array of creativity and expression". He said it overlooked Elizabeth Marina and the iconic "Sail" sculpture on the Waterfront's promenade. 
This group exhibition has evolved to represent 31 of the finest and most intriguing visual artists currently working in Jersey, ranging from those with a lifetime’s experience, to emerging talents," said Mr Rolls. He also said the exhibition highlighted the collaborations between JDC and the islands artist community. Mr Rolls said: "JDC has been incredibly supportive, marking the beginning of a growing relationship that recognises the importance of the Creative Industries for Jersey's future wellbeing."CEO of JDC, Lee Henry, added they were pleased to temporarily repurpose the units to benefit the community and in particular "art and culture".
"JDC’s ambition is to transform St. Helier’s Waterfront into an engaging and active destination where people want to live, work, and visit," said Mr Henry. JDC said the art market exhibition would be officially opened by the Connétable of St Helier, Simon Crowcroft, and it would run until 3 August.
