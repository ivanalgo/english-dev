A woman has won nearly £20,000 in a pregnancy discrimination case against a Somerset cheesemaker.Storm Botha said she was told having a baby would "jeopardise" her career at White Lake Cheese near Shepton Mallet, adding she was told she would be moved to a lower pay grade when it was revealed she was pregnant in 2021.She had initially been working in marketing for the company for £11 an hour, but bosses moved her to wrapping and affinage for £9.50 an hour.Ms Botha suffered a miscarriage in November 2021, and was later let go from the firm a month later under the guise of redundancy, which was branded a "sham" by a judge at an employment tribunal.
After revealing she was pregnant, Ms Botha said she was called into an "ambush" meeting in September 2021, where her work in marketing was criticised by boss Roger Longman, the employment tribunal sitting before Judge Street in Bristol was told.It was there she was told she was effectively demoted - a role she later refused.Mr Longman insisted he did not know of her pregnancy when he made the decision to move Ms Botha.Ms Botha's notes from the meeting, shared at a tribunal, claimed she said: "Roger, I'm pregnant, I can't work in the cheese room." He allegedly replied immediately, saying: "I know, that's why you will be working in wrapping. Oh, and congratulations."The tribunal conclusion said: "She had 14 days to decide whether to accept the reduction in pay or leave."It added that between 22 September and 22 October 2021, Ms Botha had to work in the affinage and wrapping department, where she had to "turn, wash and lift heavy cheeses in a refrigerated room".She miscarried two months later, said to be as a result of panic attacks and concerns over her job security.The court judgement said it was in the aftermath of her miscarriage when she was invited to redundancy consultations, despite having a fit note from a doctor saying she was unable to work.Ms Botha was then dismissed from her role on 13 December following a redundancy review.White Lake Cheese must now pay Ms Botha £19,694.42, made up of financial losses and "injury to feelings", with the judge ruling Ms Botha suffered pregnancy discrimination.The BBC has contacted White Lake Cheese for comment.
