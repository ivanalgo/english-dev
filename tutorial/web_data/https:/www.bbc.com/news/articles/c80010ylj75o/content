Can pupils from Northern Ireland's most diverse primary school dig it? Thanks to a unique archaeological project, they most certainly can.The schoolchildren of St Patrick's Primary School in Dungannon, County Tyrone, have been time travelling by getting their hands dirty at one of Northern Ireland's most significant archaeological sites.And the project at the Hill of O'Neill, part of a new Community Archaeology Programme by Queen's University Belfast, has proved a hit.Paula, originally from Lithuania, said: “I like living here because the history is so interesting to me and I love being able to discover more.”The three-year project is giving members of the public free access to rare archaeological digs, skills sessions and tours throughout Northern Ireland.
Dungannon has a sizeable East Timorese, Portuguese, Polish, Lithuanian and African community.St Patrick’s now has the highest number of newcomer pupils of any primary school in Northern Ireland.A newcomer is a pupil who is often originally from outside the UK and does not initially speak the same language as their class teacher as a result.The school recently took part in the Community Archaeology Programme at the Hill of O’Neill, located at the highest point in Dungannon’s town centre.
The family of nine-year-old Raphael are originally from Portugal - he said: "During the trip were looking at artefacts found there and we got to draw them and we even got to pick up and feel them, it was amazing."Kenisha, who is also nine with family from East Timor, said her favourite part was "whenever we went outside". "We got to measure the old castle on the hill and I think we did a really good job.”For their teacher, Suzanne McKenna, who speaks of her pride at the school's many nationalities, there is "no better place" for the project than the Hill of O'Neill. "We’re so lucky to have a site that is steeped in such history, so close to us."
The Hill of the O’Neill is located on a hilltop in the centre of Dungannon and now serves as a cultural hub and park for the town.For much of the 20th Century this site had been used as an RUC and Army barracks before it was transferred to the local council in 2007.The historic building on the hilltop today represents the remains of a late 18th Century mansion, of which two circular corner towers still stand - but the location has a much deeper history.
By the later medieval period the site had become the principal power centre for the Hugh Ó Néill lordship in County Tyrone and the setting for his main castle.The O’Neills would dominate political power in Ulster and this would remain the case until the beginning of the 17th Century, with south-east Tyrone—and Dungannon—at the epicentre of their lordship.
In the aftermath of the Ulster Plantation, the Ó Néill capital was taken over by Sir Arthur Chichester.He was the lord deputy of Ireland and a veteran of the English army, which had defeated the Gaelic lords led by Hugh O’Neill during the Nine Years War of 1594–1603.A new town grew up around the hilltop and, while the castle seems to have continued in occupation through to the 1680s, by the end of the 17th Century it had been demolished.
Peter Lant, the education officer at the Hill of O’Neill, gave the St Patrick's pupils a tour of the site during their recent trip. “The importance of this site can’t be overstated, the O’Neill’s had worldwide connections, from the king of Spain to the king of France," he said. “When the O’Neill’s had their castle here, the power struggle to become the strongest clan on the island of Ireland, would rival anything you see on TV shows like Game of Thrones.”
Archaeological excavations of the Hill of O’Neill were carried out in 2003 and 2007 and revealed remnants of the old castle.Queen’s University archaeologist Brian Sloane, who was part of the dig, said "it was a really important excavation because we found the remains of Hugh O’Neill tower house, it’s about six to eight feet under the ground of the current site".“During the excavation we found things like jugs dating back to the 1600s, and to be the first person to hold it for 500 years or think that maybe Hugh O’Neill drank from it, that’s why archaeology is incredible.”Mr Sloane, now excavation director of the Centre of Community Archaeology at Queen’s University, gave a demonstration to the St Patrick’s Primary School pupils during their recent trip to the Hill of O’Neill.
“The kids took scale measurements of the site and took drawings, much like we did when we were excavating the site, it’s a bit of craic and they enjoy being out of the classroom and doing something extraordinary.“It’s about impressing on the children that the site, the soil, the artefacts, can all tell a story, because with the next scrape of dirt there’s always the possibility you will find something amazing.”The Community Archaeology Programme NI (CAPNI) received a grant of more than £600,000 from The National Lottery Heritage Fund to the Centre for Community Archaeology (CCA) at Queen’s University Belfast.
