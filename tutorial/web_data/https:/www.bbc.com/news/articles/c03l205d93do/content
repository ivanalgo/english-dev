A councillor has admitted that structural failings in eight tower blocks could possibly be the "catalyst" for them being demolished in the future.Brighton & Hove City Council said new preliminary surveys found the buildings did not meet standards relating to their ability to resist collapsing in the event of an explosion or large fire.The authority said there was no immediate danger but it had put temporary regulations in place, including a ban on e-bikes and e-scooters in the blocks, and on vehicles parking beneath them.Councillor Gill Williams told BBC Radio Sussex that it was impossible to tell how long the measures will last, or what needed to happen next, until the full report is available in August.
The eight blocks affected are:
The blocks, in Hollingdean, Whitehawk and Kemp Town, were all built using a popular method in the 1950s and 1960s which used precast concrete panel walls.Asked if the failings meant the blocks could be demolished, Ms Williams said: “These are really old buildings and it is a question that we would need to come to at some point in time, so maybe this is a catalyst.“We now need to look at refurbishing or regeneration - we have to do one or the other.“We could refurbish, but how much is that going to cost us? Would regeneration be a better option?"It may well be that what we have done is sufficient."Regeneration means buildings are upgraded from their original standard, whereas refurbishment means they are repaired to their original standard.The council is paying £80,000 each month for around-the-clock security at the blocks to report any issues and ensure that no-one is bringing banned items on site.“We have to, we don’t have a choice,” said Ms Williams. “We have to bear the cost.”
