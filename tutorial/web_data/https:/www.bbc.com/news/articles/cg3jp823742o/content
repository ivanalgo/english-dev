A group of cars have coordinated to come to a complete stop on the M11 for the second day in a row, prompting another police appeal.On Tuesday several brightly coloured sports cars, believed to be Lamborghinis, stopped on the northbound carriageway just before the junction five exit to Loughton.On Wednesday evening, Essex Police was alerted to similar behaviour from a number of cars that had brought traffic to a standstill.Sgt Will Willsher said: "I can't emphasise enough how dangerous the driving which has been described to us is." He has asked people with details of the cars involved and anyone with dashcam footage to get in touch.
One woman, from Loughton, contacted the BBC after the original incident and said: "I was made to stop by the drivers as I was coming down from Chigwell."They looked like they had been at a wedding as they were all dressed on fancy clothes and had corsages."There were also 4x4 cars with them that were holding up the traffic."Mr Willsher added: "The people who are doing this are putting others at risk and that's simply not acceptable."He added the force was working with National Highways and making contact with a number of motorists to gain their accounts.
