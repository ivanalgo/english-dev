Plans to provide temporary beds for homeless people in overnight pods have been submitted to a local authority. Sunderland City Council is looking to open four emergency temporary rooms as part of its planned homeless hub in the city alongside the Salvation Army. The flats would be housed in a standalone steel modular unit and be located in the garden of the charity's Swan Lodge building.Each one-room flat would have a bed, toilet and sink as well as heating and power, the council said as it submitted the scheme to its own planning department.
Each room would also be fitted with non-invasive "vital-life sign sensors" to monitor for breathing loss, similar to those used in care homes, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.The Salvation Army would provide the day-to-day operation of the micro-flats, the planning document said. A decision is due by September.
