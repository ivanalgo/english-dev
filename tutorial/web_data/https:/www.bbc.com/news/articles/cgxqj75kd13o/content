Members of the public clapped and cheered after plans to build a McDonald's branch were refused.The proposed development would be located in the former site of Chinese restaurant Buffet Island, which sits opposite a roundabout in Pheasey, Walsall.Residents argued it would cause "traffic chaos", while a spokesperson for McDonald's said traffic surveys showed it would not have a severe impact on the road network."If you don’t think that’s a highway danger, I’m sorry, I don’t agree. It exists already and this will exacerbate the problem," said councillor Adrian Andrew.
The application was originally recommended for approval by Walsall Council's planning officers, but was called into the planning committee by Mr Andrew, on the grounds of public interest."This is not like a pub, it's not like a restaurant, where people come in, park their cars, sit down and have a meal, it is a constant stream of people and traffic to the detriment of the people who live there," he said.Concerns with the restaurant’s proximity to three schools, litter, biodiversity, and light pollution from the McDonald’s totems were also raised in the meeting.Councillor Bobby Bains led the motion to refuse the planning application on Thursday, and only one member voted against it. It was ultimately refused, along with a separate application for associated totems.
