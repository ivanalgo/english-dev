A collection of wonderful woollen landmarks which could have faced "landfill" have been rehomed. Margaret Seaman, 95, from Caister-on-Sea, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk has been dubbed the "Queen of Knitting" and was trying to find new homes for her incredible knitted creations which have raised Â£130,000 for charity. Robert Green, owner of Wroxham Miniature Worlds in Norfolk, has now given them a permanent home after seeing them on television when they were on display at the Norwich Makers Festival.He said: "It just shows you can make models from anything from card to wool."
The collection includes replicas of Buckingham Palace, the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk and the "NHS Knittingale" hospital , created during the pandemic to raise money for the NHS. Mr Green said: "I am so proud to be able to show this off to our visitors that come to Wroxham Miniature World. "It's such an amazing collection and is one you just have to come and see to actually truly appreciate the work."
Mr Green wanted to rehome the collection after seeing the display on television."She [Ms Seaman] kindly agreed to come and visit me here in Wroxham and she fell in love with what we do," he said. The display of knitted work will be featured at the miniature world alongside vintage toys, slot cars and model railways. The collection also involves Ms Seaman's nostalgic work bringing the Great Yarmouth Golden Mile in the 70s to life from how she remembered it when she worked in the town. It also features her first creation - a koi carp pond which she made for her late husband.Ms Seaman said: "We were looking at the fact I might have had to put them [the creations] into landfill... I'm very pleased we are here and I think it looks absolutely fantastic." From start to finish, it has taken the indoor model attraction six weeks to install the knitted gems.
