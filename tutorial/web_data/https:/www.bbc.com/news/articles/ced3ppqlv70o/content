A Leicestershire council has been given a grant to tackle mess caused by chewing gum being spat out in the street.North West Leicestershire District Council has been given a grant of £7,200 from the Keep Britain Tidy charity's chewing gum task force.The money will be used to buy new specialist removal equipment and signs urging people to bin their gum properly.The authority said chewing gum litter was unpleasant and expensive to clear up. 
Michael Wyatt,  the council's portfolio holder for community and climate change, said:  “Many of the streets, pavements, and shopping areas in our towns are affected by discarded chewing gum, which can be very difficult and expensive to clean up.“I’m pleased we’ve been successful in securing this funding. "It will really help us to clean up what’s already there and to remind people that the only suitable place to dispose of gum, and any other kind of litter, is in the bin.”The council is one of 54 across the country to have successfully applied for money, provided by gum manufacturers, to address the problem.Follow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
