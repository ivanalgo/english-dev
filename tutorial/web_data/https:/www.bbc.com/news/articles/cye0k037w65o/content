A remote Yorkshire Dales farm has been transformed into an education centre for pupils to experience the rural way of life.Jamie's Farm, near Skipton, offers children from urban areas the opportunity to learn about farming, from herding sheep and feeding livestock to gardening and cooking.The 245-acre farm is one of six across England which works with children who might have become disengaged with education. Visit co-ordinator Ben Paulden said the centre helped to build confidence and self-esteem in the children.
Pupils visit for six consecutive weeks and work in small groups, with each session beginning with a discussion about achievements, successes and feelings.Farm manager Mark Carnie said visits were "fully immersive"."We take their phones off them [and] we ask them not to bring their own food and fizzy drinks," he said."They get into an environment where they feel safe, they can relax, we have them working with the animals, with cows and sheep, some of them might be cooking. "I think they feel at home, feel welcomed and they get involved and they just love it."Among those to visit the farm are pupils from Eastwood Community School in Keighley.Jannat, nine, said: "Being with the farm people being with the animals, feeding the animals it makes me happy, it makes me feel welcome. "They teach you new stuff that you didn't know and at the same time you have fun with it."
Fellow pupil, Billy, added: "Since I have started coming here I have really enjoyed it. "I like seeing the animals and doing some work on the farm. I have learnt you always need team work on a farm to get the job done."Headteacher Mark Whittaker said for some pupils their knowledge was so lacking trips to the farm mean they now knew "the difference between a sheep and a cow"."People might think that's a bit funny but a lot of these children don't see those things at home," he said."There is that knowledge and understanding of the world, a richer understanding of what surrounds them for these children."Mr Paulden said: "We were working with quite a few schools in Leeds and Bradford and we were really happy to see that the day visit programme made a difference to these young people to their confidence and their self-esteem. "The teachers back in school would tell us that when they were back in the classroom after coming here they were really confident, putting up their hand up to answer questions and turning up to school more."Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
