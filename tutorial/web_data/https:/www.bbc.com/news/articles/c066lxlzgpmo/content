Two Labradors have been appointed "assistant vergers" at Tewkesbury Abbey to meet and greet visitors.Eric and Florence can now be seen in their new roles on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.The pair, who belong to the head verger, are also acting as therapy dogs for those who visit the Abbey and even have their own badges.Head Verger Chris Skepper said the dogs "seem to put the visitors at ease".
"I know a lot of cathedrals are discussing their dog policy but I think we've gone that one step further," he added.Thanks to their training, both dogs not only perform as greeters but also act as therapy dogs.Both children and adults are able to pet the animals.
During services, including Evensong, they lie quietly on their mats in the side aisle.Mr Skepper said: "We've had a case where a lady has come to a service and she couldn't sit in it because she'd just lost someone recently but she came and found these [the dogs] and just sort of sat and stroked them."That's what she needed at that time - just that oasis and that calm that that presented in the building," he said.
Reverend Nick Davies said: "People love to come and visit Tewkesbury. It's a great place to visit."There's loads of art, loads of heritage, loads of culture here."There's loads of history here and if we can make it a little bit easier for those people coming with dogs, so much the better."All God's creatures are welcome in Tewkesbury Abbey," he added.
