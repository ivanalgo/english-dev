Parents have criticised council officials for cutting a free bus service for secondary school pupils serving their village, claiming children will be forced to use roads without pavements.Conwy council axed the service between Ysgol Bryn Elian, Old Colwyn, to the community of Llysfaen as part of budget cuts.It provides free transport for children living more than three miles (4.8km) away from their school, but those who live closer must pay or find their own way.But parents of some pupils have said although Llysfaen is about 2.8 miles (4.5km) from Bryn Elian, a free bus has been provided "for as long as anyone can remember".Councillor Julie Fallon, the cabinet member for education, said the route had been reassessed and was "no longer classed as hazardous". 
Neil Hart, who is leading the campaign, said the route had previously been "deemed too hazardous for children, with Llysfaen surrounded and made up of rural roads without pavements for pedestrians".He said the authority sent out letters earlier this month "stating that the bus service would cease at the end of this term"."There was no consultation with either pupils, parents, or the school," he said."If children were to walk to school, it would take over an hour on roads that donâ€™t have pavements."
Darren Millar, Member of the Senedd for Clwyd West, said the decision was "totally unacceptable and will pose a significant challenge to local families"."Many will be left struggling to find and fund alternative arrangements, particularly given the lack of capacity of local bus services," he said."While I appreciate the local authority is having to consider the budget implications of home-to-school transport arrangements, this is clearly the wrong decision."Ms Fallon said: "We've written to the parents/carers whose children currently receive free transport on this route to let them know that from September 2024 we will no longer be able to provide the service and that it will be parental responsibility to ensure children travel to and from school safely."Pupils currently receiving statutory home-to-school transport are not affected by this change."
