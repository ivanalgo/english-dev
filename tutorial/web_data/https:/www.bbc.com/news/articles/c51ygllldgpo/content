New charges are being brought in at nine tip sites across Derbyshire.From 1 August, residents will be charged £4 per tyre for up to a maximum of four domestic car or van tyres and £6 per sheet of asbestos.Visitors will be charged to dispose of tyres and asbestos at Ashbourne, Bolsover, Bretby, near Swadlincote, Chesterfield, Glossop, Ilkeston, Loscoe, near Heanor, Northwood, near Darley Dale, and Waterswallows, near Buxton.Derbyshire County Council said the charge is to cover the £69,000-a-year cost of accepting both items at its sites.
Payment is by card only and doesn’t apply to bicycle tyres.Councillor Carolyn Renwick said: “We’re constantly looking for ways to make the services we provide more efficient and effective.“Having listened to the views of residents, we believe these changes strike the right balance between continuing to provide a good quality service for residents and making savings.”Further changes will be introduced at county recycling centres on 1 October, including reducing opening hours by two hours each day.The new opening hours will be 09:30 to 17:00 GMT, except at Buxton, which will continue to open from 08:30 to 18:00.The county council also plans to trial accepting trade waste at a later date, and wants to introduce a permit scheme for domestic customers.Derby City Council's recycling centre at Raynesway is not affected by the changes, and doesn't currently charge to dispose of tyres and asbestos.Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
