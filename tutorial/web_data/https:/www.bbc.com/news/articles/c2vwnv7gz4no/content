Five naked knitted figures in a café window have been covered up after being branded as "inappropriate". A group of knitters made the figures during their weekly meet-up in Hive Café and haberdashery shop in Shepton Mallet to "give people a laugh" and raise money for charity. But some locals took to social media to voice how they felt the high street window display was inappropriate as it was "too close" to two schools.In response, Mike Alford, who runs the café, has covered up the dolls with "censor strips".
Mr Alford said that a woman came into the shop to complain about the figures saying that she did not want her grandchildren looking at their "genitals on the way to school". "It actually spiralled from this complaint really," he said."I should probably thank the lady for bringing more people in."As well as receiving two in-person complaints, the café's naked knits - which were made to raise money for Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance - were also the topic of conversation online."Since the debate on social media, people have been coming into the café to donate to the charity, so really, the display is doing what it needs to," Mr Alford said.
Mr Alford added that he was surprised by the negative reaction and found some of the online responses "quite disheartening" as he felt the knitting group had worked so hard to make them. The social media post has since been removed but the display is expected to stay up until the end of the week. One of the knitters, Sandra Witchombe, said the group plans to do a Glastonbury themed window next and they hope to feature the "long drop" toilets.She said that the knitting group is a "bit of fun" and that every year they pick a different charity to donate to.
