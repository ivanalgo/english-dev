A bus to help rural residents get to a town centre surrounded by steep hills is being trialled.The Hoppa Bus service is designed to aid people travelling to and from Wooler town centre in Northumberland.The bus, which began operating on Monday, will run between 10:00 and 15:00 BST, Monday to Saturday, for a 12-week period. Conservative councillor Mark Mather said he hoped the new bus would help those who were unable to walk into town due to the climb.
The trial will run until 12 October, according to Northumberland County Council. Mr Mather said he hoped the service would be "popular" and continue to run beyond the trial period. "If it is a success we can progress to the next stage of applying for funding for a permanent service," he said. The bus is being funded by the National Lottery, Northumberland County Council and the regionâ€™s Bus Service Improvement Plan (BSIP).
