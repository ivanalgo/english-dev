Hundreds of laptops and SIM cards are to be handed out to disadvantaged families as part of a council campaign to help them get online.The initiative by Trafford Council will see the refurbished devices offered for £60 to low-income residents in the Greater Manchester borough.They will be distributed through a series of community pop-up shops that will open across Trafford from next week. Councillor Liz Patel said the scheme would help "bridge the gap" for those who could not afford to get "suitable access to devices to get online".
The 'Tech4All' initiative will see 250 discounted devices made available, alongside free SIM cards and low-cost broadband plans.A Trafford Council spokesman said much of the tech had been donated by Virgin Media O2.Those who want to buy one of the devices must provide proof of address to show they live in Trafford.Those applying must also demonstrate they are receiving some financial support such as Universal Credit or housing benefits. Ms Patel said it was "very important" that all residents had online access so they could stay connected and look for work.
