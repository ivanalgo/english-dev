A nurse who was found to have put her “patients at risk of harm” faces being permanently struck off if she fails to prove she no longer poses a danger.Alison Morris, of West Suffolk, has been hit with a three-month suspension after being found guilty of misconduct by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC).She was originally served a 12-month conditions of practice order in July 2022 before the sanction was extended for a further 12 months the following year.Mrs Morris was found to have failed to escalate concerns about a patient with deteriorating mental health who was considered at high risk of committing suicide.
She was also accused of not maintaining accurate records to a suitable standard before a panel ultimately decided her fitness to practise was impaired.The healthcare worker has now been warned she faces being banned from the profession all together if she does not engage with the council.
In documents seen by the BBC, the NMC’s Fitness to Practise Committee said: “The panel has concluded there still remains a risk of harm to the public.“The panel was of the view that a three-month suspension order would afford Mrs Morris adequate time to engage with the NMC, and to demonstrate insight.“The panel decided to impose a suspension order for the period of three months to give Mrs Morris a further opportunity to engage with the NMC.“The panel gave serious consideration to a strike-off order. The panel noted that a strike-off order would be available to the next reviewing panel.”Mrs Morris’ three-month suspension will come into force from 28 August.A panel at a future hearing will then consider whether to strike her off the register, impose further sanctions, or revoke or replace the order.
