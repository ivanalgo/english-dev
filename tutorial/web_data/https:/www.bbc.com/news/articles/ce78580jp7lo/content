Mr Jenkinson's partner ordered a pizza from the food delivery app on 14 December 2022.But Rocha arrived at the wrong location, down the street from the customer's home, prosecutors said.When he went to get his food, he forgot his phone and a brief argument ensued about the delivery code number he needed to provide.Mr Jenkinson said he was then bitten, as if he had "gone through a chainsaw".
"All I remember, I was shaking her helmet trying to get her off," the 36-year-old plumber told the BBC."The force with which she must have been biting, she'd clean taken it off."John Hepworth, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Mr Jenkinson has suffered from life-changing injuries, the impact of which cannot be understated. "This attack has permanently altered his life.“Jeniffer Rocha’s assault far exceeded that of any force necessary and her conduct was completely unacceptable."
In April, BBC News filmed Rocha still delivering food, despite Deliveroo taking action against her.The firm said it had previously cancelled an account she had been using in December and subsequently terminated a second account.Rocha had been working as a so-called "substitute" rider, sharing someone else's account.The big three delivery apps - Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats - announced in April they would tighten up their systems to check the identities of "substitute" riders.A spokesperson for Deliveroo said: "This was a truly awful incident. We fully cooperated with the police on the investigation, and our thoughts are with Mr Jenkinson."
