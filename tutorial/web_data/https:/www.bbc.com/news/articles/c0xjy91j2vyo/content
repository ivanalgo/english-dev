A rail campaign group has welcomed a decision by a train operator to introduce an extra late-night service, but is disappointed it is only for four weeks. From Saturday to 30 August, a TransPennine Express train will leave Edinburgh Waverley at 23:00 BST on weekdays, calling at East Linton, Dunbar, Reston, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Alnmouth and Morpeth before arriving into Newcastle at 00:59.The company says it is to allow people attending the Fringe to enjoy a show in the evening. Dennis Fancett, from the South East Northumberland Rail Users' Group (Senrug) said: "It's good news but Northumberland stations need a permanent service leaving Edinburgh at 23:00 or thereabouts to support the many evening activities in the city."
"I really hope the new service is popular and well used," Mr Fancett said."It’s just a real pity the trains can’t run on Saturday as well, which is when we believe there would be the highest demand, both during the Edinburgh Festival period and indeed throughout the year."
TransPennine Express (TPE) has been under government control since May 2023 after complaints about delays and cancellations. 
Adam Fairclough, head of customer experience at TransPennine Express, said: "We are pleased to be able to offer extra services for those travelling during the Fringe Festival and to support the city of Edinburgh during this popular event."More than two million people are expected to travel to the Scottish capital for the Fringe, the world's largest arts festival, with thousands of shows taking place across more than 250 venues in and around the city.
