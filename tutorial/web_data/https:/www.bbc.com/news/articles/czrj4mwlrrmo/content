Plans to open a pub named after the local featured on TV soap Coronation Street has disgruntled neighbouring business owners.Proposals have been made for the Rovers Return, in Blackpool, to serve alcohol until 02:00 on Fridays and Saturdays.Lyndsey Ann Whiteside has applied to Blackpool Council for a new premises licence for a property atÂ 52 Coronation Street, which has not been licensed since 2014 and most recently operated as a food store.A licensing panel will decide the application.
Ms Whiteside is seeking permission to serve alcohol in the bar named after the local on ITV's soap from 10:00 to midnight apart from Friday and Saturday.The application also seeks permission for music from 23:00.The Local Democracy Reporting Service writes four submissions have been made by objectors who claim there will be an increased risk of anti-social behaviour and noise disruption.These include Conservative councillor Gerard Walsh, who owns St Nicholas's holiday apartments on the same street.In documents submitted to the hearing, he said a cumulative impact assessment showed there was already over-saturation of licensed premises in the town centre, with 400 in Talbot ward in 2019, and the highest level of alcohol-related incidents reported to the police.An objection submitted by Sharon Morgan, operator of Lola's Cafe also on Coronation Street, said she feared music from the bar "would cause serious noise nuisance", while Alfred Caruana of the next door Cheers Hotel, warned of potential disturbance for his guests including families with children.A council report said Ms Whiteside had agreed to a number of conditions if the licence was granted, with proposals to ensure the bar was managed properly including the installation of CCTV and a Challenge 25 policy to deter under-age drinking.Door staff would be employed from 22:00 on Friday and Saturday and customers would be advised by staff to leave quietly late at night.
