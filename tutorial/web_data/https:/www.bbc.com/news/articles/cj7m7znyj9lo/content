A marina's main slipway has been closed off after a pair of swans nested on the ramp. Sunderland City Council fenced off the slipway, which is controlled by Sunderland Marina, on Wednesday, meaning boat owners have been directed to use alternatives.One of the swans, known as Bonnie, was born on Silksworth Lake in 2013 and has lived in a number different areas around the city.The council has advised people to keep away from the area because the birds can be "extremely protective of each other, particularly their nest".
Users of the marina who own passes have been told they will be extended to account for the disruption. People have been told not to feed the swans, and dog walkers should keep their dogs on leads.The fencing will remain until the eggs hatch, the council added.
