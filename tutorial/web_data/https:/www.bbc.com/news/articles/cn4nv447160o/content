Parents are being warned about the illegal use of e-scooters after a teenage girl was convicted of causing serious injury by careless driving.The 16-year-old was found guilty following a crash outside Letchworth station in Hertfordshire.On 7 January 2023, she attempted to cross the road on an e-scooter while the pedestrian lights were red.She collided with a motorbike and police said the motorcyclist suffered "potentially life-changing injuries".
Det Con Ellie Cowling said: "This was a devastating incident, not just for the victim, but also because a teenager has had to appear in court and has ended up with a criminal record."
The girl appeared at Stevenage Youth Court on 22 February and will return to court for sentencing in April. Electric scooters are illegal for road use, except for registered users in designated zones.They can only be used on private land with the landownerâ€™s permission, but government figures in 2023 showed more than half of casualties from e-scooter accidents took place outside permitted zones.  Ms Cowling said: "I am sure many parents may be buying these scooters for their children thinking they are harmless fun but, as this case demonstrates, they can be extremely dangerous, with devastating consequences. "Please think very carefully before you purchase one of these scooters."At this current time there are very few places you can legally ride one, and we will seize e-scooters being used in public areas and prosecute riders, where appropriate."
