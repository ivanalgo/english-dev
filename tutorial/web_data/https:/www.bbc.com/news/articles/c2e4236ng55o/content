People affected by anti-social behaviour are being asked to complete a county-wide survey.Lincolnshire County Council said the results would help its teams to "target" its work.The County Views summer survey, which focuses on anti-social behaviour, closes on 16 September. Forms are available both electronically and in paper format.In February, it was announced that Lincolnshire Police would be given £1m of government cash to tackle the problem.
Councillor Patricia Bradwell, the authority's executive member for community safety, said: "No one should be made to feel distressed or intimidated in their own community, and that’s exactly what anti-social behaviour can do."With so many behaviours constituting anti-social behaviour – including littering and noise nuisance to more severe crime such as vandalism, intimidation and arson – it’s so important for us to understand what is affecting residents the most.“Your feedback will help us target our work with partners to effectively tackle anti-social behaviour and protect victims.”The form can be found here.
