Bus services across the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) area could be under public control from 2027, the mayor has said.The proposals would see services run on a franchise model, with routes, timetables, fares and the standards of services decided by Transport for West Midlands (TfWM), part of WMCA.A final decision could be made by March, after an independent audit and public consultation later this year.If approved, the transition is estimated to cost about £22m. 
The policy was a lynchpin of Richard Parker's successful campaign to become West Midlands mayor in May.
“Our buses are failing. The West Midlands is paying an additional £50m subsidy every year to private operators and yet they increase prices and cut services year-on-year," the Labour mayor said."Though the public purse is funding the incomes of private bus operators, we have no real say in how they run our buses. This has to change."He said an internal assessment had concluded a franchise model was the best option.
Under the model, bus companies would effectively bid for contracts to deliver services.But while the operators would own the vehicles, the other details - including prices and when buses run - would be decided by TfWM.
Assuming a final approval next year, it is estimated there will be a two-year transition during which the new bus network will be designed and contracts tendered. It will affect services across Wolverhampton, the Black Country, Birmingham, Solihull and Coventry.The current subsidy agreements with bus operators are due to finish at the end of December, with a risk for further service reductions. TfWM has said it is working with bus operators to review services and secure further funding to maintain the network during the transition period.Some changes to bus routes and services from January are expected.
