A trip to Jersey would never have possible without his PTSD support dog, says a veteran.Mark Lanchbery, 62, suffered life-changing spinal injuries in 2008 while serving in the Army that meant he had to use a wheelchair.He began to struggle with his mental as well as his physical health before he met Jerry in 2015.Mark, who is now able to walk, said: "Without Jerry I couldn't have come on this holiday, he gives me the courage to go out and explore places."
His visit to the island last week was funded by Holidays for Heroes - a Jersey charity that brings injured veterans to the island.Jerry is one of 29 dogs to be awarded a PDSA Order of Merit, which recognises animals that display outstanding devotion to their owner or wider society.Mr Lanchbery said the award "speaks volumes to what Jerry does" for him and other veterans.Jerry wakes him up if he is having a nightmare and will help pick items from the ground as well as emptying the washing machine.He said: "Jerry been an absolute diamond, a real lifesaver."
The veteran said: "It gives you that confidence to go out and do things that you would have done before I becoming a bit of a recluse at home, no interest in life."Of his trip he said: "We visited the war tunnels as I am a military man. That's quite interesting to me the bunkers and that sort of stuff as well as the German bunkers."The beaches are beautiful too and the whole general atmosphere of Jersey fits me so I'm just wondering when I can move in."Mr Lanchbery said it would be great if more dogs like Jerry could be trained to help veterans.He said: "It is a big thing in America but it is still a little bit tentative in the UK but it makes all the difference."Mr Lanchbery said dogs like Jerry "help veterans focus on something else" and he had seen the impact it had had on other veterans.Jerry was trained by the Service Dogs UK programme, a charity that trains PTSD Assistance Dogs for veterans of the Armed Forces and emergency services.
