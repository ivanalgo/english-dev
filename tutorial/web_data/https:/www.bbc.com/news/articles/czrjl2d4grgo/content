Members of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) are to meet with senior Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officials over video footage circulating online.In a statement, DUP leader Gavin Robinson said he spoke with Chief Constable Jon Boutcher on Monday morning.The chief constable, according to Mr Robinson, is in "no doubt" of the need to "reaffirm confidence in the PSNI's impartiality, integrity and professional standards".It comes after videos emerged of officers taking part in celebrations following Armagh's All-Ireland victory over Galway on Sunday.
The footage appears to show officers in police vehicles waving flags and sounding their sirens.The PSNI have subsequently started an internal investigation.BBC News NI understands DUP MP Carla Lockhart, assembly member Keith Buchanan and the party's policing spokesperson, Trevor Clarke MLA, will meet with officials at the PSNI headquarters at 16:00 BST.The DUP delegation is expected to speak with members of the media after their meeting.
The incident followed the Armagh GAA team winning the coveted Sam Maguire cup with a score of 1-11 against Galway's 0-13.Supt Norman Haslett said: "We are aware of footage circulating on social media of our officers, driving Police Service of Northern Ireland vehicles, taking part in celebrations following Armagh winning the All-Ireland final.â€œWe have commenced an internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding this," he added.The PSNI Code of Ethics requires officers to carry out their duties impartially.TUV leader Jim Allister said he would be contacting the police ombudsman, Northern Ireland's police watchdog, and the chief constable following a "disgraceful display by officers in a marked PSNI car tonight in Camlough"."They can be seen driving through the village waving GAA flags in a fashion which could best be described as joyriding while using the siren improperly," the North Antrim MP continued."Loyalists are often challenged about why we talk about two-tier policing. "Tonight we see evidence of this in bright lights."
There will be those who find the actions of the officers inoffensive.They also argue "is this not an example of community engagement which will assist the organisation?".The PSNI, remember, still has an under-representation of those from a nationalist background.So the fact the office of Police Ombudsman has received messages of support for the officers, as well as complaints, is hardly surprising.Policing in Northern Ireland is very often viewed from two opposing perspectives.This incident is another example.
In a statement, the police ombudsman said a number of complaints about the incident were received.But they also received "correspondence expressing support for the officers involved". The ombudsman said they were "engaging with the PSNI" about the matter.
Separately, two vehicles which were painted orange and white in support of the Armagh GAA team have been found burnt out in County Armagh.Both incidents are being treated as a sectarian related hate crime and as arson, police said.A lorry painted with the slogans 'Armagh 4 Sam' and 'Sam is home' was severely damaged, according to photos supplied by Cllr Thomas O'Hanlon.The PSNI received a report of a lorry on fire on the Markethill Road at about 01:35 BST on Monday.They added enquiries are ongoing.
About five miles away a car on the Ballymacnab Road, which Mr O'Hanlon said was also decorated for the match, was gutted by flames. Police said they received report of this incident at about 02:25 BST.It is understood the incidents are not believed to be linked.
