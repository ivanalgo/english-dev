Teachers are set to strike over allegations of bullying and discrimination at a Lincoln primary school.Three unions have organised a series of nine strikes in May and June at Sir Francis Hill Community Primary School.The school has been the subject of criticism after teaching unions made suggestions of poor management behaviour.Martin Smith, assistant director of children’s education at Lincolnshire County Council, said “negotiations between the school governors and unions are continuing."
Several members of staff have left the school in recent months, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Members of the National Education Union (NEU) voted in favour of industrial action and staged a picket line outside the school in April.The NEU has been joined by the unions NASUWT and UNISON for the latest action.Lincolnshire County Council said the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) was independently mediating discussions between school governors and the unions and senior council officers were supporting the school leadership team.
