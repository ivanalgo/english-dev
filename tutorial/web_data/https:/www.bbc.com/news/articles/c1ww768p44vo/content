A pensioner has told how the thought of applying for his Blue Badge parking permit renewal has left him "in a state of panic".Ralph James, 70, from Bootle said he relied on his permit due to longstanding and painful disabilities which impacted his mobility. Local authorities across England are reporting delays in approving and renewing applications.Sefton Council said it had seen a "significant increase" in applications, with more than 600 received every month.  
The Blue Badge scheme is designed to help people with disabilities or health conditions access designated parking areas and give exemptions to standard parking restrictions.  Using an expired badge is illegal and failing to renew one in time could lead to a £1,000 fine.Mr James said the application delays "could end up criminalising disabled people like me".“The process puts you into a state of panic and I just feel completely and utterly helpless and despondent," he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.“I know the consequences of not having a valid badge and I also know it’s down to a defunct admin process."He said putting people living with a disability through this worry "through no fault of their own" was "disgusting".The rules for eligibility and applications are set nationally, but the administrative process is managed by local authorities, such as Sefton Council. The badges cost £10 in England and usually last up to three years, with the holder needing to reapply before the current one expires.A Sefton Council spokesperson said the authority recommended applications be submitted at least 12 weeks before the expiry date on the badge.Applications could take up to 42 days to be assessed, or longer if considered "subject to further assessment", they added.“We have seen a significant increase in applications in the last few years and currently receive more than 600 applications every month," they added.
