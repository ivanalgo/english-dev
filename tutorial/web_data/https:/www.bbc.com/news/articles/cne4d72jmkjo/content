A zip wire for teddy bears is being set up inside a 12th Century church to raise money for building repairs.The one-day event will allow people to send cuddly toys down an aerial slide set up in the St Mary Magdalene church in Lincoln.The cable will take stuffed animals on a high speed journey from the organ loft to the doorway of the church.Helen Jones, one of the churchwardens, said "it's been great fun" organising the event.
Ms Jones said: "It's been tremendous, if ever I'm awake at night it's thinking about teddies going down zip wires, sometimes I can't get back to sleep I'm laughing so much."She said it was being arranged "to bring people in, let them see what a lovely church we have here but also raise money for much needed repairs".Repairs include new lighting to make the building - which is next door to Lincoln Cathedral - more visible.The event will see the church "totally transformed" Ms Jones said.A "magic walkway with fairy lights" will lead to a basket for the cuddly toy, which will be hoisted into the organ loft. There will then be a short pause with a countdown before ted is sent zooming across the nave.The event happens from 10:00 BST on 20 July, and those without bears to hand will be able to "rent-a-ted".
