An artist has thanked his community and customers for helping him reopen his seaside restaurant following a break-in at its previous site next door.On New Year's Eve, Desmond Baldry, 59, discovered burglars had stolen wine, damaged equipment and slashed some of his paintings at Desmondo's - his Italian-styled bistro in Lowestoft, Suffolk.He decided he wanted to move to a different venue and three months later has opened his new venture, called Desmond's, with help from customers who raised nearly Â£900 to help.He opened for lunch last week and has decorated the premises with his artworks.  
Recalling the burglary, Mr Baldry said: "My wife... came round to the business to grab a bottle of champagne and when she got there, it had all gone along with a lot of stock, a lot of wines and  damage to equipment. "So we did a lot of tidying up and phoned the police. After that I made some rudimentary repairs and carried on, but because they came in the back way, every time I heard a seagull hit the conservatory roof, I had the feeling there was someone behind me and I decided I couldn't carry on like that any longer.'' 
Mr Baldry decided to make a move but he did not go far because an opportunity came up to take over the shop next door on London Road South, in Kirkley, and he hopes the new premises will become a hub for local artists and writers.  He said the money raised by the local community and customers had "helped a great deal"."I suppose all in all it probably came to about 10-15% of what I have laid out, but it was very useful indeed," he said."I was overwhelmed, really. I think I've probably come to the realisation that people are generally good - especially fellow restaurateurs and owners of like-minded businesses who understand the difficulties that there are in running a business like this.''
