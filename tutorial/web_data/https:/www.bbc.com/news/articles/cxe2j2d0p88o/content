More than 14,000 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats so far this year.The figure of 14,058 was reached after the Home Office confirmed 419 people made the crossing in six small boats on Tuesday.It is about 10% higher than last year, when the number of people crossing was 12,772 by July 2023.The Home Office said: “Everyone wants to see an end to the dangerous small boat crossings.”
Several children were among those pictured being brought ashore in Dover, Kent.Groups of people were seen being escorted from Border Force boats and lifeboats wearing life jackets, with some wrapped in blankets.The latest crossings mean 484 migrants arrivals have been recorded over two days of activity in the Channel since Sir Keir Starmer became Prime Minister in the wake of Labour's election victory last week. A total of 65 migrants arrived on Monday.
A Home Office spokesperson said small boat crossings were “undermining our border security and putting lives at risk”.“We are taking action to smash the people-smuggling gangs responsible for this trade,” they said.“Our staff continue their heroic efforts to save lives in the Channel whilst working with our French and other international partners to ensure the criminals responsible face the full extent of the law.”Last year, 29,437 migrants arrived in the UK after making the journey, down 36% on a record 45,774 in 2022.The English Channel is one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes in the world.Many migrants come from some of the poorest and most chaotic parts of the world, and many ask to claim asylum once they are picked up by the UK authorities.
