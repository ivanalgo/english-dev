A man who launched an attack so vicious his victim lost an eye has been jailed.Police were called to a Newcastle bar where a man had been seriously injured in August last year.Saam Bayat, of Granville Court in Jesmond, handed himself in following a CCTV appeal.The 34-year-old was sentenced to more than nine years in prison on Wednesday after pleading guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent at Newcastle Crown Court.
Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Constable Samuel Carr said the attack had had a "life-changing impact" on the victim.He added: "I hope the strong sentence goes some way to helping the victim process the trauma of this horrific incident.“Violence has absolutely no place in our communities and Bayat is now rightly behind bars where he will have a significant amount of time to reflect on the damage he has caused.”
