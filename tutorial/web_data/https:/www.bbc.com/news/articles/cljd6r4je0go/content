The Irish president has been presented with an honorary degree by the University of Manchester.Michael D Higgins spent two days on the city's campus and was due to give a lecture to guests after receiving the honour.The 83-year-old, who was inaugurated as the ninth president of Ireland and re-elected in November 2018 to serve a second term, undertook postgraduate studies at the university from 1968 to 1971.He said the honour had "particular resonance" given his family connections with the city.
The honorary degree came after Mr Higgins revealed he had a "mild form of stroke" in February.He spent several days in hospital after experiencing a "mild transient weakness", his office said at the time.Speaking at the conferral ceremony, the president said: “The conferral of a Doctor of Letters (Honoris Causa) from this esteemed university is an honour I very much appreciate, receiving it as I do in what is a very special year for the University of Manchester as it celebrates its 200th anniversary."This honour that you have bestowed on me has a particular personal resonance, given my family connections with Manchester. "My two sisters came to Manchester in the late 1950s and married and reared their families here. "This was followed by my own experience as a postgraduate student at this university in the late 1960s, times of hope and promise."Mr Higgins, who is also a poet, writer, broadcaster and sociologist, said it was his time at the university that instilled in him a "profound and lifelong interest in migration". He added: "This honour I accept today, not just for myself, but for all migrants and those who study and care for them."Prof Nancy Rothwell, president and vice-chancellor of the university, said: “It is especially important during our bicentenary year in which we celebrate 200 years of our incredible people and community and look toward the future.”During his visit, Mr Higgins will also deliver the first of a new annual series of lectures at the university named the John Kennedy Lecture Series, so named in honour of industrialist Dr John Kennedy CBE.  The lectures will promote topics related to the island of Ireland and will be live streamed and available to watch online.Commenting on the lecture series, Dr Kennedy, said: “It is an honour and tremendous pleasure to welcome the president of Ireland to the first in this new series of lectures. "I am very proud to not only support education in the UK but in particular to be alongside The University of Manchester as it celebrates its 200th anniversary and remains a pioneering centre of excellence and achievement."
