A controversial US dog trainer, who has almost four million subscribers on YouTube, has prompted RSPCA concerns over plans to visit Birmingham.The RSPCA says Augusto Deoliveira, known as The Dog Daddy, reportedly uses aversive training techniques and equipment designed to cause pain and fear in dogs.These include prong collars, which the RSPCA calls "painful and unethical".The BBC has approached Mr Deoliveira for comment about the animal charity's concerns.
His website advertises that he is holding workshops in Birmingham on Sunday 4 August and Monday 5 August.It then says he will be in Saffron Walden in Essex on Tuesday 6 August and Wednesday 7 August.However, the venues have not been publicised, and at previous events they have not been confirmed until hours before the show.
Last year, the USA-based trainer was due to hold a workshop in London, but this was cancelled the day before.Dr Samantha Gaines, RSPCA dog welfare expert, said: "The RSPCA is concerned about The Dog Daddy’s training techniques and we are urging people to make a stand against this."We, like many organisations, have significant concerns about the use of aversive training techniques and equipment such as prong collars, which are designed to cause pain and fear. "These can compromise welfare and are completely unnecessary.“We promote and recommend reward-based training techniques that dogs like or enjoy and have been shown to be very effective in achieving long-term change in behaviour without compromising dog welfare."
Dr Gaines said the animal charity had previously written to Mr Deoliveira to raise its concerns with him, as well as making him aware of the legislation in England and Wales, with which he must comply when training dogs.The "secretive nature" of the events has also prompted the charity to urge anyone with information to pass this to them via social media - but not the charity’s emergency line.Dr Gaines added: "We are keen to discuss our concerns with the venues hosting this trainer, though these are yet to be advertised. Anyone with information can share this with us via our social media platforms."
