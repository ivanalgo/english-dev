Parents have called for action to protect schoolchildren from a road crossing they have labelled a "death trap".Middleton St George residents have urged Darlington Borough Council to move the crossing point on Middleton Lane to a safer area.They say pupils at St George's Church of England Academy are at risk of speeding drivers and fear a child could be seriously injured.A council spokesperson said the authority took road safety "very seriously" but that it had been unable to find a replacement for a lollipop lady currently off work.
Parents and children have had to queue along a narrow pavement and walk through traffic in her absence.One person told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: "It’s a death trap and an accident waiting to happen."We’re very lucky that no-one has been badly injured."
Borough councillor Colin Pease said he had "put forward several potential solutions to highways at Darlington Borough Council and all have been rejected"."The crossing is in the wrong place and is clearly not designated as a crossing," he added."I even paid for Children Crossing – Keep Clear signs out of my own pocket which, although the crossing patrol said they were a great help, highways said they should be removed in case there was a claim."This has not gone down well with residents as they feel the council is more interested in avoiding potential claims than child safety."I continue to revisit this problem until a suitable solution is provided and funded."
The council said: "Road safety is something we take very seriously and we will always try to support parents and families to ensure children get to school safely."We have three mobile school crossing patrol staff, whose role is to cover absences.  Unfortunately, all three are assigned elsewhere at the moment."St George’s Church of England Academy has been contacted for comment.
