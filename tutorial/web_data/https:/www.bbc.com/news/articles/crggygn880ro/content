The 60th anniversary of Dr Who has been marked by one museum with a Dalek invasion.The Helicopter Museum in Weston-super-Mare hosted a day of "intergalactic fun" on 23 June, complete with fancy dress and celebrity appearances.Life-sized animatronic Daleks stalked the display hangars of the aviation attraction, and a live interactive "Audience With The Daleks" Q&A was hosted. The museum also opened up several of its helicopter cockpits that have links to TV and science fiction for visitors to explore throughout the day.
Daleks are the fictional extra-terrestrial nemesis of the timelord known as the doctor.The live Q&A was the perfect opportunity for the public to pose questions to the merciless aliens.The museum was brought to life with costumed characters from the Dr Who archives, including some past doctors themselves.The best children’s and adult’s costume were even awarded with helicopter flights during the summer.Lee Mills, the museum manager, said about 500 people attended the event. “It was good," he said."The children obviously love the Daleks - they go mad when they come in."Many attendees went dressed as characters from the show's past and present. "Some people spent lots of time sewing and making costumes," Mr Mills added. The Helicopter Museum is a registered charity that houses the worlds largest collection of helicopters, with more than 100 Rotary wing aircraft gathered from all over the world.
