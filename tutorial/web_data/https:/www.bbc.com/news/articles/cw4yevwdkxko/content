Fundraisers dressed up as doctors and nurses will be pushing a bed around the streets of Ludlow at the weekend in what has become a popular annual event.The group are hoping to raise funds for the end-of-life suite at the local community hospital.The event has been running for more than 30 years, and is one of the Ludlow Hospital League of Friends' main sources of income. Jennifer Gill, co-chair of the charity, said the group hoped to improve overnight sleeping arrangements for patients' families so that they can remain in the hospital with them. 
"The League of Friends think it essential that continued improvements are undertaken at our community hospital for the benefit of south Shropshire residents," she added.The fundraiser is also in memory of the late Marina Clent MBE, who was a trustee of the league for many years.
Last year, the event raised more than Â£3,000 for blood monitors for the hospital."We are in awe of the fabulous work the League of Friends do for Ludlow Community Hospital, and to be a small part of that does give you a sense of pride," said Mark Hiles, who takes part in the bed push."And what better way to raise vital funds for our community hospital than get dressed up, have a little fun and bring a smile to everyone."We are always blown away by the generosity of the public and the enthusiasm that the event continues."
