A teenager who saved a building from a fire by the skin of his teeth is being honoured on his 100th birthday.Ronald Brignall was 16 years old when he saved Cardiff's City Hall after an incendiary bomb fell by clamping a sandbag between his teeth and climbing a drainpipe.He was cheered on by the official fire-watchers as he went back up with a fire hose - also gripped in his mouth - to finish putting out the fire.Cardiff Lord Mayor Bablin Molik, is travelling to Mr Brignall's care home in Steyning, West Sussex, on Thursday to present him with a special certificate thanking him for his heroism.
The youngster had been walking home from college in 1941 when the air raid sirens started and he saw the incendiary device - designed to start fires - land on the roof.Speaking to a local paper at the time, Mr Brignall's only comment was his jaw was sore from carrying the sandbag and he had ruined his suit.Speaking ahead of his birthday honour, he said: "I was only a teenager, and I didn't have any fear."I just wanted to make sure the bomb didn't do any damage to City Hall."
Following the war-time event, Mr Brignall later became an official fire-watcher, helping to protect the city, before joining the RAF in 1944.He became a rear-gunner on Whitley and Halifax bombers, featuring in Operation Varsity, the crossing of the Rhine by the Allies, in 1945.Mr Brignall's son Ian said: "He's always been a modest man and rarely talked about his war record."We only knew of his heroics in Cardiff on that day because he'd kept some newspaper cuttings from the time."Dad's a little frail now, as you'd expect from someone who is 100, but I know he is thrilled to have this recognition and the certificate from the council. It's a perfect present on his birthday."
Ms Molik said she was delighted to be able to present Mr Brignall with his belated honour.She said: "The best part of my work as Lord Mayor is meeting remarkable people and Mr Brignall is a great example of those who have so much civic pride in Cardiff."I know this is a rather belated honour but it is no less heartfelt and I assured Mr Brignall and his family that the whole of Cardiff expresses its gratitude for the heroics he performed on that day in 1941."
