One of Britain’s most high-profile aristocrats has claimed the care home looking after her late uncle was negligent.Retired jeweller Norbert Marshall died aged 102 after fracturing his hip in a fall at Plas Isaf Home in Rhos-on-Sea, Conwy county.At an inquest in Ruthin, his niece, Lady Bristol, said she was shocked when she saw his feet in hospital.“His toes were blue, his nails were three inches long and he was very unkempt,” she said.
“I had a shock when I saw him. He was in a terrible state.”Lady Bristol, mother of socialites Victoria and Isabella Hervey, said she believed his nail length left him unsteady and led to his fall.“I believe it to be negligence on the part of the care home,” she added.
Lady Bristol - also known as Yvonne Hervey, the Marchioness of Bristol - is the widow of the sixth Marquess, and divides her time between London’s Eaton Square and Monaco.The inquest heard Mr Marshall, who retired to Llandudno after falling in love with the town as a child, took pride in his appearance.He was diagnosed with dementia and moved into the home two and a half years ago.He could walk with assistance but had fallen about six times.On 29 October, 2003, he was taken to Glan Clwyd Hospital with a urinary tract infection but later returned to Plas Isaf.On 2 November he was found lying on the floor of the lounge and taken back to hospital.His condition worsened and he died on 13 November, the cause of death being given as pneumonia.The fall, frailty and dementia were contributory factors.
Photographs of Mr Marshall’s toes were shown at the inquest.Coroner John Gittins said he was concerned when he saw them.Current manager, Gwyneth Conway, said: “We were shocked.”She said the manager at the time left after failing to pass their probationary period.Mrs Conway said there was now more training, risk assessments for falls and chiropodist visits.Recording a conclusion of accidental death, Mr Gittins said he appreciated changes had been made.He added that Mr Marshall had been walking with the assistance of carers.“I certainly do not attribute the fall to his feet,” he said.
