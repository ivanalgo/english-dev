In his social media video, Mr Tice said he was "appalled" after hearing about the alleged incident.He said: "This is no way of having a democratic debate and discussion."We can disagree, but we don't fight each other. That's not what our democracy is about."He added Mr Rubidge did go back on the campaign trail for a further four hours on Saturday.
A police spokesperson said: "Police were notified on Saturday 15 June to reports that a man had been assaulted on Grove Place in Falmouth."Enquiries are currently ongoing to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident."They added anyone with information about the incident should contact investigating officers.
