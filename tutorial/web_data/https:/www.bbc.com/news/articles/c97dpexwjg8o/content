A new music group for fathers is helping them talk about "sleepless nights" and how they are coping, its organiser has said. St George's Church in Colegate, Norwich, started Sing Together, Grow Together, to promote wellbeing for new fathers. The free sessions are for fathers of children aged two or under and has been funded by the Norfolk Community Foundation. Matt Hayward, who started the group, and attends with his 16-month-old daughter Isla, said: "I like the collaboration, and being there with the music."
Mr Hayward, 37, said: "It's so nice to see the dads being there, you can talk about sleepless nights, how you are getting on with walking, it's lovely seeing the dads chat. "I think it's a lovely thing to do with your child, as a lot of sessions are mid-week and mum-focused. "Come and join in, it's really welcoming and you get a cup of coffee and a bit of cake." 
The Sing Together, Grow Together project promotes singing, which the group says "teaches communication skills, coordination skills and supports brain development".Favourite songs from the sessions will be added to a special songbook to help families continue in their own homes.
Mr Hayward added: "It's so lovely to see the kids interacting together, it's not a sharing circle, dads can open up as much as they want to."He said mothers could also attend as the groups were for "dads and families". "If a mum is still breastfeeding, she can come along, but then have a rest for an hour and a half."
Rev Annie Blyth, the church's assistant priest, said: "I love it, it's absolutely marvellous. "To me church is about love and the community, we serve people however we can, it just fills me with joy."The next sessions, which can be booked online, are on 13 July, 21 September and 26 October.
