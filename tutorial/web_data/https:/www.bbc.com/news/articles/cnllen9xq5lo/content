A beer named after Osama Bin Laden has sold out after going viral on social media.Staff at Mitchell Brewing Co had to unplug phones and close their website temporarily because of demand for Osama Bin Lager.The company, of Billinghay, Lincolnshire, also brews Kim Jong Ale and Putin Porter."They're all tongue-in-cheek names – a nicer outlook on some horrible dictators," co-owner Luke Mitchell said.
Millions of people have seen a picture of the beer – named after the former al-Qaeda leader who died in 2011 – posted on social media. Husband and wife Luke and Catherine Mitchell run the brewery and a pub."We've woken up the last couple of mornings with thousands and thousands and thousands of notifications," Mr Mitchell said."It's been crazy," Mrs Mitchell added. "The phone just hasn't stopped for the last 48 hours."
"Everyone laughs when they see the names on the bar," Mr Mitchell said."As far as I'm aware, no one's been offended, but I'm sure there is someone out there," he added. "I think there's always a risk of somebody being offended," Mrs Mitchell said.The brewery donates £10 from each barrel of Osama Bin Lager to a charity that supports victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
