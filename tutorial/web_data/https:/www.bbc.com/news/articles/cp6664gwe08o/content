Musicians from the Royal Marines have performed an emotional tribute for their terminally ill bandmate for "one last time".Sophie Ward, from Warminster, was joined by her new husband L/Cpl Richard Ward, who is also a Royal Marines musician, for the concert in the grounds of Dorothy House hospice, in Winsley near Bradford-on-Avon.The 27-year-old flautist, who has motor neurone disease (MND), and fellow patients were wheeled out to watch the spectacle with staff and volunteers on 18 June.L/Cpl Ward said it was a "wonderful day".
He added: "Dorothy House is set in such a beautiful location, it was the perfect setting for the band to come and play for her."The staff are absolutely exceptional, they also looked after the family in the best way they could as well as Sophie, and we’re eternally grateful for that."
MND is a life-shortening condition affecting the brain and nerves and Sophie has been at the hospice since mid-June.The couple were both part of the Royal Marines Band based at HMS Collingwood and L/Cpl Ward is now based at the Commando Training Centre, in Lympstone, Devon.Capt Phil Trudgeon RM, director of music of the band, said: "The day was full of a range of emotions as we performed a Beating Retreat with music selected by Sophie. "I felt overwhelming pride as the band played so spectacularly and hope we brought moments of positivity and joy to all."Sophie will always be a part of our unique Royal Marines Band Service family.”
At the end of the performance, Sophie, who played flute and saxophone in the band, was presented with her Coronation Medal by senior members of the Royal Marines.Chief executive of Dorothy House, Wayne De Leeuw, said: “Thank you to Sophie and Rich for giving us the opportunity to share in something so personal, something so very public and something extraordinary."He added that the band "brought happiness" to the day and "also made us shed a tear and realise the value of life and the things that really matter to people.”
