Patients on the Isle of Man have been warned of ongoing delays in booking GP appointments and getting prescriptions following Friday’s global IT issues.Manx Care said while all of its systems had now been restored, the outage had created a “backlog”.The disruption last week led to the island’s primary care services reverted to “business continuity plans”.In a statement the health care provider said: “We ask for the understanding of all patients and service users as staff work hard to catch up with this backlog.”
Anyone having trouble logging into the Patient Access system has been asked to avoid calling GP practices for help and “wait for a day or two before trying again”.During Friday's disruption, GPs continued to see patients who already had appointments but surgeries were unable to book any new ones, and pharmacies were unable to access prescriptions electronically. The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company confirmed that issues with payment systems on its ferries had also been resolved.
