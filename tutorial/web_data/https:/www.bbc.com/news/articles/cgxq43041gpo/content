England fans in London are being urged to plan their journeys ahead of the Euros final as bus and Tube services maintain their usual Sunday timetable.A City Hall spokesperson said the capital is expected to be "exceptionally busy" as England takes on Spain. The O2 in Greenwich, south-east London, will host one of London's largest fan zones after more than 300,000 people entered a ballot for a ticket, the spokesperson said. Responding to questions why it did not extend services for the match, Transport for London (TfL) said such changes need to be "planned several weeks in advance".
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: "Sunday has the potential to be one of the greatest nights in the history of the England men’s team.“Wherever you are watching the match, whether that be at The O2, in one of our fantastic pubs, clubs and venues or with family and friends at home, be sure to plan ahead so you can enjoy the night safely."
The match is due to kick-off at 20:00 BST and TfL has warned customers if it goes down to the wire on penalties it may not finish until after 23:00 BST.The decision not to extend Tube services past the normal Sunday timetable, which sees services finish earlier than other days in the week, attracted criticism online.
A TfL spokesperson said: “Changes to timetables and planned engineering works on the Tube need to be planned several weeks in advance due to the detail required and the complexity of our network, meaning any changes would had to have been made before the tournament started."They added additional bus services are being put on at The O2 for those attending the fan zone.TfL has asked customers to ensure they plan their journeys to their venue of choice and back home and to allow for extra time on busy transport.
