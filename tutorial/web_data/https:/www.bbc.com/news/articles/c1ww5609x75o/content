A former primary school teacher who groomed and sexually abused a vulnerable 14-year-old girl has been jailed for five years.James Auchterlonie, 33, met his victim on Instagram and three days later had sex with her in his car, Newcastle Crown Court heard.The girl, who had previously suffered "severe childhood trauma", said Auchterlonie had "exploited" her vulnerability.Auchterlonie, of Lovaine Ave in Whitley Bay, admitted five offences and was said to be "genuinely remorseful".
Prosecutor Jessica Slaughter said Auchterlonie and the girl started messaging on Instagram in February and the "conversation quickly became mutually flirtatious and sexual".
Ms Slaughter said the girl looked older than 14 but did tell him her age, and while it could not be proved he knew of her "severe childhood trauma", he did ask her if she had "daddy issues", to which she replied yes.They exchanged further messages on Snapchat in which Auchterlonie talked about being "bad" and not caring that sex with her would be illegal.He then picked her up in his car and drove to a secluded spot where they got into the backseat, the court heard.He continued to molest her despite her request to stop and, after he finished touching her, told her it was his "turn" and they had sex,  Ms Slaughter said.After being dropped off back at home by Auchterlonie, the girl became upset and told her mother what had happened, Ms Slaughter said.
In a statement read to the court, the girl said she was rebuilding her life after her earlier trauma but that had been derailed by Auchterlonie.She said she felt "constantly dirty" and as if she had "lost control" of her life, adding she felt "sick to the stomach" being around men.The girl said Auchterlonie "exploited" her vulnerability, telling him: "You came into my life and targeted me for your own sexual fulfilment,  never once considering me."Her mother told the court she struggled to express the "anger, disgust and pain" caused by Auchterlonie who, as a teacher, should have been there to "nurture and protect" children, not destroy their lives.She said her daughter was already traumatised and Auchterlonie  "blew her world apart"."She was underage and that turned you on," the woman told him, adding: "That’s my child, my baby, you were leering over and planning to abuse."
In mitigation, Joe Culley said Auchterlonie took full responsibility for what happened and expressed "genuine remorse", adding he hoped his victim could "move on" and have a fulfilling life.Mr Culley said the girl had "not been plied with alcohol or drugs" and Auchterlonie "exploited and manipulated an opportunity" that arose after the girl "befriended" him on Instagram.Judge Gavin Doig told Auchterlonie: "This whole episode was a disgrace and you should be thoroughly ashamed of yourself."The judge said he accepted that the sexual activity was "consensual" but Auchterlonie's initial claim to police that he believed the girl to be 16 was an "outright lie"."The messages show you knew it was wrong and it did not stop you," Judge Doig told Auchterlonie.The judge said the girl had not been a pupil of Auchterlonie’s when the defendant was a teacher.Auchterlonie was also made subject of a 10-year sexual harm prevention order and must sign the sex offenders registration for life.He admitted having sexual communications with a child, meeting a child following grooming and three counts of sexual activity with a child.
