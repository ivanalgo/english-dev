Veterans are being offered half scholarships to help them use their leadership skills for future corporate careers.The University of Bath is giving its full-time Masters of Business Administration (MBA) programme as part of its commitment to the Armed Forces Covenant Agreement, which it signed last year.It is open to veterans and serving personnel who intend to leave the military.Former officer Dan Tope, who received the scholarship in 2022, said it was "exciting" for him to finally understand where he wanted to go next.
“It gave me the broad knowledge I wanted, giving me an oversight of multiple business areas and a understanding of aspects of business to which I was previously unsighted," he said.“From a veteran’s standpoint, the MBA was an excellent opportunity to pause and take stock of my career to date and know where I wanted to go next."Mr Tope worked as an officer for the British Army for 12 years and after completing the univeristy course, found himself a new career working in business administration with Amazon.
Becky Gallagher from the University of Bath said the course helps "integrate" veterans into the corporate world by building on the skills they already have."We are committed to supporting the future career of those who have served in the UK military and who are now looking to advance their service leadership experiences and develop these for a civilian pathway," she said.The university is making up to 10 scholarships a year available to veterans for 2024 and 2025.
