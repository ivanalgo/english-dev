A former greengrocers in Ossett could be turned into a dental practice to help address the "chronic shortage" of services in the town.Plans to turn Sandra's Cabbage Patch into Ossett Dental Care have been submitted to Wakefield Council.Documents supporting the proposal state the practice would "help to remove the barrier to accessing much-needed dental care".They also state the applicant, Claire Stott, has been working with Wakefield Council to help young people attain dental nursing apprenticeships.
A heritage statement said the area's former MP had "expressed concern over the ‘chronic shortage’ of dentists in the district, which is why Ossett Dental Care aims to cater to the Ossett community and surrounding areas".Proposed works involve converting the ground floor into a dental surgery and waiting area, with a decontamination room at the rear.If approved, the shop front and windows, described as being in “poor condition”, will also be replaced.The property lies within a conservation area but is not listed as a building of historical importance.In July 2022, Wakefield Council voted in favour of a motion calling on the government to urgently reform NHS dental services, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.The authority also asked its adult services, public health and NHS scrutiny committee to investigate the state of dentistry across the district.Figures from a subsequent report revealed 40% of 12-year-olds in the district had tooth decay.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
