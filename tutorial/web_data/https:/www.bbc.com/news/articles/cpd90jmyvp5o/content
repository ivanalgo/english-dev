The first day of the 31st annual Goodwood Festival of Speed in West Sussex has been packed with non-stop motoring action.The five-day festival at Goodwood House, near Chichester, calls itself “the greatest motor show on Earth”, welcoming celebrities and motor racing royalty through its gates each year.Festival veteran Colin Hoolahan, who has been to Goodwood since it began in 1993, said: “The first one was very quiet but now it’s bedlam.”More than 200,000 people are expected to attend the festival this weekend, hoping to catch a glimpse of their favourite vehicles.
“It’s a fabulous meeting,” said Mr Hoolahan. “It’s amazing to have been coming back for over 30 years.”Notable names attending Thursday’s events include Maria Costello MBE, who held the Guinness World Record for being the fastest woman to lap the Isle of Man TT until 2009, and drift racer James Deane.
“No other motor sport event brings this many people under the one place, it’s special, it will never get old,” said Mr Deane.One highlight to dazzle spectators was the electric-powered Tesla Cybertruck – currently the only one in the UK.
The theme of this year's Goodwood is "Horseless to Hybrid – Revolutions in Power’.The festival aims to celebrate the "love affair with motorsport".
