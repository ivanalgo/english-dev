Alice Higgins, Lifeguard supervisor for west Dorset said: "Our lifeguards have spent the last few weeks going through inductions and training to make sure they are ready for the new season."As ever, we want people who are coming to the coast to enjoy themselves this summer but to do so safely."It is our strong advice that people head to a lifeguarded beach, swim and bodyboard between the red and yellow flags and if you want any advice to ask an RNLI lifeguard."The charity is urging anyone visiting the coast to heed its beach safety advice.It also provides lifeguards for beaches in Bournemouth, Poole and from July 13 in Christchurch.
