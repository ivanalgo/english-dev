People in Telford are being offered advice on how to lose weight after a survey found many did not know how.Those who sign up to the Healthy Telford Pledge will be given weekly online advice and help in setting realistic goals.Kelly Middleton, the Telford and Wrekin councillor who is overseeing the project, said the borough faced "higher than average numbers for children and adults that are overweight or obese".She said the aim was to support them "to make small and simple changes to their lives".
The council survey was carried out at the end of last year and the Labour councillor said: "Residents were aware they needed to lose weight, but felt shame or stigma about it.Some, she explained, "didn't know how to go about trying to be healthy".Senior health practitioner Becky Procter is working on the 12-week campaign and said one of the focuses would be finding something personal to motivate those signing up.She said a lack of motivation was often a major barrier to change.A closed Facebook group has been set up for people to discuss their progress in private.
