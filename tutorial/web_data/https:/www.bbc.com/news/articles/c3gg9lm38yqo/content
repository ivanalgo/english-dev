Drivers face being sent more than 30 miles into a different county to avoid roadworks. Resurfacing works on the B3227 Sandyâ€™s Moor roundabout near Wiveliscombe, Somerset, starting this week will close the road linking the town to Taunton. Each evening from Thursday, 13 June to Wednesday, 19 June a diversion will be in place adding up to 36 miles to people's journeys. Larger vehicles will be sent across the Devon border, across the M5 and all the way to Tiverton. 
The road will be closed between 18:30 BST and 23:30 BST, though will operate as normal throughout each day, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). A county council spokesman said the works were necessary "as the road is showing signs of wear and tear, but added the team was doing "everything they can to minimise disruption".Vehicles wishing to reach Wiveliscombe from the east will be diverted into Wellington, out to Tiverton and towards Bampton before rejoining the B3227. Smaller vehicles may be able to use more local roads around Wiveliscombe to reach the town; however, these will not be formally advertised.
