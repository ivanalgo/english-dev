The brand’s export business is worth more than £2m.Alongside increasing production, the investment will also go towards upgrading facilities for the factory’s 100 employees, including improvements to workspaces and staff changing rooms.Farmers Alex Albone, Simon Herring and James Sweeting founded Pipers in 2004.Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
