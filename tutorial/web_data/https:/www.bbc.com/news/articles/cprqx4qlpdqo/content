A borough is preparing to celebrate its first ever Pride festival.Knowsley Pride will include a week of community activities to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community, culminating in the main event on Friday 2 August.Liverpool drag artist Filla will be hosting, with Ru Paul's Drag Race UK star, Sister Sister, among the acts appearing."For many in the local LGBTQ+ community, the only options to socialise or celebrate involve travelling into city centres, but Knowsley Pride brings the festivities into the heart of our borough," Filla said.
"As a ‘Kirkby girl’ myself, having a local Pride event like this is incredibly important," Filla added.The event, which takes place at Court Hey Park, Huyton, has been organised by the One Knowsley charity in conjunction with Knowsley Pride Steering Group and with funding from The Michael Causer Foundation.A spokesperson for Knowsley Pride said the event was taking place on the 16th anniversary of the death of openly gay teenager, Michael Causer.Michael Causer's family believe his murder was a hate crime, though a judge dismissed homophobia as a motive when jailing the 18-year-old's killer.Mr Causer's family set up the Michael Causer Foundation in his name to support young LGBT people across North West England.One Knowsley took over the running of it in 2023.
They said that a vigil would be held at the conclusion of the festival to acknowledge Mr Causer’s impact on the LGBTQ+ community.Mr Causer, who was born in Whiston, was murdered in 2008, with his death leading to the return of Liverpool Pride in 2010 after a 15-year hiatus.Racheal Jones, chief executive of One Knowsley, said they were "committed to ensuring the memory and legacy of Michael Causer continues with the annual vigil in his name, promoting inclusivity and equality across the borough in a collective mission against hate".
Sister Sister, who will do storytelling sessions during the festival, said Pride existed to "celebrate our community’s history and achievements, but also to acknowledge our fight for equality"."The first Knowsley Pride is taking place on the anniversary of the tragic murder of a young gay man, Michael Causer, which only amplifies this message, and I am proud to be a part of it, bringing queer joy and reading for the children’s story hour," she added.Knowsley Council leader Graham Moran said: “The events will be inclusive to people of all ages and involve a range of organisations in celebrating the life of Michael Causer and showing the support we have in the borough for the LGBTQ+ community."Knowsley Pride takes place from 10:00 to 15:00 BST on Friday 2 August 2024, with the Michael Causer vigil taking place at 18:00 BST.
