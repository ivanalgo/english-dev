Patients with heart conditions in Somerset and Wiltshire will benefit from a new and improved clinical space at the Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust thanks to a £1m refurbishment.The RUH’s old cardiac catheterisation lab, also known as a cath lab, has been  transformed to bring it up to date with the latest state-of-the-art equipment.The lab is where cardiology tests and procedures take place, including surgery involving stents, pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators.The new kit gives staff access to the latest treatment and diagnostic technology including a reduction in the X-ray radiation dose delivered to patients.
The new lab has been designed to provide enhanced support during cardiac-related surgery.Bradley Isaac, speciality manager for cardiology at the RUH, said: “The new cath lab is a fantastic addition to the facilities we offer our cardiology patients.“The new equipment provides us with the latest technology to treat the people we care for and ensures we can continue to provide them with the very best experience at all times.“This new facility reflects our commitment to providing our patients with the very best care and support.”The trust works closely with Bath and North East Somerset and the Swindon and Wiltshire Integrated Care Board.
