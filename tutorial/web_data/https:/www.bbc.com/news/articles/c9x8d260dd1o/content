A swimming pool at a leisure centre in North Yorkshire will be closed for two weeks while new boilers are installed.The work will be carried out at Selby Leisure Centre, in Scott Road, from Monday.A letter to customers said there had been ongoing problems with the boilers over the last few months, which had been affecting the pool temperatures and hot water supply.Inspiring Healthy Lifestyles, which manages the centre on behalf of the council, apologised "for any inconvenience" to customers.
“The work is needed and as you may appreciate, given the size of the pool, new boiler installations on the scale required isn’t something that can be fitted quickly," a spokesperson said.“Should the work be completed ahead of schedule we will reopen the pool and recommence bookings."It said any pool bookings already made during the closure would be automatically cancelled.The centre's gym and studios will remain open, but there will not be any hot water supply
However, there will not be any hot water in the changing rooms.The letter added that people could use their membership to alternatively use Tadcaster Leisure Centre’s pool, in Station Road, Tadcaster, which is part of the same IHL group.To access the pool, people just need to check the timetable and then show staff at reception that they have an active direct debit membership through the IHL app.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
