A man living near a newly developed leisure centre said construction vehicles had left the road leading to it in a "terrible state". David Anscombe lives just off Station Road in Mablethorpe, where the £13.5m Station Leisure and Learning Centre opened on 16 July. Mr Anscombe said: “We thought when we’d got the nice new sports centre we’d get the road finished, but it’s just getting worse and worse and worse.”A spokesperson from East Lindsey District Council said the road would receive temporary repairs "in the coming weeks" and a "full patch repair" after the summer season.
According to Mr Anscombe, the potholes had previously been fixed three times in the last five years, but the repairs had not lasted and the potholes reappeared a few months later. He said: “It does no good to the car at all. And I’m a pensioner, I can’t afford to keep having it repaired.“When you’re driving up and down it two or three times a day, it soon damages your car.”Mr Anscombe said he believed that fixing the road had not been a priority for the local council as it was in a residential area.
A spokesperson for East Lindsey District Council said the condition of Station Road was "brought to the attention of Lincolnshire County Council Highways before works were started" on the leisure centre.They added they were "liaising" with the authority's highways team to ensure repairs were carried out. The £13.5m update to the leisure centre includes a new leisure centre, fitness facilities and learning hub, which the council said local residents would "enjoy for years to come."Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
