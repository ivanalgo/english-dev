Plans to build up to 90 new homes in a Shropshire village are set to be decided by the council.Proposals by Boningale Homes would see the housing scheme being created on land near Shaw Lane, in Albrighton.It is the latest extension of the Millfields development in the north-east of the village.A decision will be made by Shropshire Council’s planning committee on 21 May.
Two previous applications were rejected over concerns about vehicle access to the proposed site.It is located near St Mary’s CofE Primary School to the south and the railway line to the north.Now, council planning officers have said the developer's plan to use Millfield Road as the main route on and off the site is acceptable, and have recommended the scheme for approval.A further access point for emergency vehicles and pedestrians would be provided on to Shaw Lane via School Road, the developer has said.Objections to the plans have been lodged by Albrighton Parish Council and councillor Nigel Lumby over proposed community facilities on the indicated layout.
The site forms part of an area allocated for residential development in the Albrighton local plan, which states that a children’s play area, adult football pitch, youth shelter, multi-use games area and leisure centre/sports hall would be provided as part of any development.Shropshire Council has also requested additional parking spaces close to the railway station be provided as part of the development, to help resolve issues with rail users parking on Shaw Lane.Councillor Lumby said he could not support the original application because it "didn’t provide the facilities which the community were expecting", before the scheme was amended.A report from Shropshire Council's planning officers said Boningale Homes plan to use Millfield Road as the primary access to the site was acceptable, but recommended planning conditions to ensure the public space and affordable housing issues would be resolved as part of the eventual scheme.
