A charity football match will be organised in memory of Gogglebox star George Gilbey.The self-employed electrician, 40, was working in Shoeburyness, Essex, when he fell through a skylight and died on 27 March.One of the organisers, Bill Drabble, said he hoped the match, in Gilbey's hometown of Clacton-on-Sea, would "make him proud"."It was a very, very big shock to lose him - it still doesn't feel real now," Mr Drabble added.
A man, 36, from Witham, was arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with Gilbey's death.A 47-year-old man, also from Witham, was held over the same alleged offence and later released under investigation.
Mr Drabble said the charity match, first reported by the Colchester Gazette, would be held at FC Clacton's ground on 24 August."So many people came forward. They've really, really jumped on it and they're making him proud," he told BBC Essex."George was a very good friend of mine, we always got up to antics at the weekend. "In a charity situation he would be there, and I just hope everyone is there [for him]."
The money raised from the event would be split between Parkinson's UK and Gilbey's daughter, Mr Drabble added.Among those hoping to line up at the Rush Green Bowl ground next month was former X Factor singer Stevi Ritchie, from Colchester."[Gilbey] was so funny with a heart of gold, making people smile and laugh at every opportunity," he said."To do this for George, I'm sure he'll be looking down smiling and just thinking 'Wow, this is all for me'."An inquest into Gilbey's death was opened and adjourned at Essex Coroner's Court last month.A post-mortem examination found his injuries were "consistent with a fall from height," Essex Coroner's Court heard.
