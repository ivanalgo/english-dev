Burnley Council is to press ahead with naming a street after cricketing legend James Anderson following his retirement from the international game.The authority is considering what other steps it could take to honour the world-famous sporting star in his hometown.Council recreation boss Jack Launer thanked Anderson, England’s all-time leading wicket-taker, adding: "What a career". "I hope he comes back [to Burnley] and teaches our kids to bowl," he said.
The former St Theodore’s RC High School pupil played for Burnley Cricket Club and quickly moved on to playing for Lancashire and then for England.In October 2020, a similar council meeting unanimously passed a motion which recognised Anderson's outstanding achievement of taking 600 international Test match wickets.The 41-year-old retired from Test cricket after the Lord's Test against the West Indies earlier this month with 704 wickets under his belt.Borough leader Afrasiab Anwar said the street naming would take place soon, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Mr Anwar said the council was "in the process of naming a street" after Anderson."I think the reason for that delay was that he was still playing," he said."Shortly we will be able to make an announcement but it is recognised what he has achieved and that also he has made Burnley proud."Mr Launer said he hoped the council "do more than name a street after him"."I hope we name a stand at [Burnley Football Club's] Turf Moor potentially after him – or name a cricket field stand," he added.Tory group deputy leader Jamie McGowan said Anderson was "a Burnley lad" who should be honoured. "I just think we should be incredibly proud of what Jimmy Anderson has done in terms of his sporting achievements and his career," he said. "I would like to see the ball rolling on actually coming up with some sort of recognition for him, whether it’s renaming Belvedere Road to the Jimmy Anderson Way or something like that."Mr Launer said: "We can work on stuff for decades to come because he is one of the most famous sports people in the world."
