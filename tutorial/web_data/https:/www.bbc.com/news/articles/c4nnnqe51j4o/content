A campaign has called for a non-selective secondary school to be built in Kent's High Weald.Cranbrook has been served only by selective grammar Cranbrook School since the High Weald Academy closed in 2022. Parents said some children are travelling for up to an hour to schools further afield and described the situation as "cruel".The Department for Education (DfE) said there are currently three non-selective secondary schools in Kent within a 10-mile radius of Cranbrook, which are rated "good" by Ofsted. 
High Weald Acadamy, a non-selective school, closed after "a prolonged period of poor educational performance" and reopened as a special educational needs (SEN) school, the DfE said.David Selby, campaign leader for Support Weald Schooling, told BBC Radio Kent there were 530 pupils within a seven mile radius of Cranbrook ready for secondary school in 2023.He said the situation was "not fair" and a "lot of families" are affected."The sensible thing is to bring it closer and have a school which can cater to those children and those families. A school should be the heart of the community."Mr Selby said the petition has more than 800 signatures.
David Clark, headteacher of Cranbrook School, said its "frustrating" for families."A lot of them come and talk to me and I can feel their pain." Secondary school teacher Charlie Baker, who lives in Cranbrook, said it put additional pressure on passing the Kent Test. She said it is "really cruel" to tell unsuccessful grammar applicants they have to travel an hour a day instead. Claire Mills who lives in rural Cranbrook with her primary-aged daughter said: "The thought of her missing a bus or the bus being full and her having to wait an additional hour is awful, especially in the winter months."Kent County Council has been contacted for comment.
