A company set up to promote, protect and support businesses on the Yorkshire coast will be scrapped after members voted against a new five-year term.The Yorkshire Coast Business Improvement District (BID) received 38 votes of support out of 227 votes cast.The group has been repeatedly criticised by local councillors and businesses since its inception in 2018 for imposing a mandatory levy for its work.Clive Rowe-Evans, chair of the BID, said, despite the result, the board and wider team were "incredibly proud of what has been achieved over the last five years".
"The ‘No’ campaign has fought diligently, and we hope that the same energy and passion will now be refocused on supporting the business community so that the area stays vibrant and well-promoted for future generations to enjoy."We still believe that the BID mechanism presents a fair and equitable way to raise funds to deliver activities that drive up footfall and spending."The organisation claimed to have supported more than 150 activities in the area between Spurn Point in East Yorkshire and Staithes in the north.It included financial support for a trail of fibreglass puffins, laser light shows and events such as the Filey Folk Festival.
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the BID had sought to raise more than £3m through a mandatory levy on retail, leisure, accommodation and food and drink businesses in the region.But dozens of businesses ended up in court after refusing to pay.Adrian Vodden, the owner of the Revelstoke Hotel in Bridlington, faced action and told the BBC the situation had been "venomous"."It has been a waste of money. They took our cash and disposed of it how they saw fit and, as a business, we've had no say. They've squandered money up and down the coast."The BID has brought nothing to my business whatsoever. As far as increasing footfall, it has done nothing. They have let us down."We know as businesses where the money needs to be spent to advertise and promote, we don't need a group telling us how to spend our money."Following the ballot, the current term of the BID will run until 31 July when the organisation will cease operations.
