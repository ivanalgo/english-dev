A town's taxi drivers have said they fear being driven out of business by the rise of Uber.Darlington council is considering the private hire company's request for a licence to operate in the borough, set to be decided next month.Hackney carriage operators warned that Uber drivers could "flood" the town if its licence was approved, and urged the authority to ensure drivers worked to the same regulations.Uber said it "operates according to the high standards set across the industry and abides by the same regulations as all other private hire operators."
A spokesman added: "Uber also leads the industry in providing every driver a pension, holiday pay and sickness protection."Labour-led Darlington Borough Council said no decision had yet been made.
Cabbies at the town's railway station said their local knowledge and service cannot be matched by others. They also pointed to the inconsistent prices charged by Uber compared to their rates, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.One cabbie said a permanent presence for Uber - which customers book using an app - would force him and fellow drivers out of a business in which they already struggle to get by.Harry Smith said: "As soon as Uber comes here permanently theyâ€™re going to flood the town with daft amounts of taxis from outside the area."In the town, there's a stigma around taxis where people say we don't work hard, long enough or are not good enough but we all do a proper job and are held accountable by the council. "As soon as this transition happens people won't realise the alligator they're bringing into the hen house."The drivers, who operate out of red hackney cabs, said Uber vehicles already operate through Darlington as they can lawfully take cross-boundary bookings. Darlington Borough Council said Uber's application would be considered by a licensing committee on 13 August. A spokesman said: "This will be in line with licensing legislation and the council's own licensing policies."
