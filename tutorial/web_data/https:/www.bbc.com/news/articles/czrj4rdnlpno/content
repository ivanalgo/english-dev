Plans for a solar farm on land next to a cemetery are set to move forward.Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council is proposing to install solar panels on a 14 hectare field next to Keele Cemetery. The land was previously earmarked for the expansion of the cemetery but was not expected to be needed for burials until the end of the proposed solar farm’s 25-year lifespan.The project is part of the authority's plans to help the area become carbon neutral by 2050.
The solar farm would measure 8.9 hectares – the equivalent of about 13 football pitches – and electricity generated would be sold on a commercial basis.It did not confirm how much the solar farm would cost but said funding from the Public Works Loan Board can be used for energy generation projects.Council leader Simon Tagg said “By investing now to generate a secure supply of clean energy, we can sell it at a market rate to local businesses and help them meet their environmental obligations."A report due to go before the council’s cabinet on Tuesday has recommended members approve the business case to allow a planning application to be drawn up.
