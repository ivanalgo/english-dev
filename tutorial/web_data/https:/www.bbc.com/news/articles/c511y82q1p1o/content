The RNLI has said it is committed to bringing a Norfolk lifeboat into service, more than two years after it was named.The George and Frances Phelon was named at a ceremony in Dorset in April 2022, but has yet to be used.The Shannon-class boat was delivered to Great Yarmouth and Gorleston Lifeboat Station in August, but because of unsuitable moorings has not yet entered operational service.But the RNLI said it was in talks to acquire a new berth in the River Yare to "provide a safe and suitable home for the lifeboat and our volunteer crew".
Delays in bringing the vessel into service has meant the station's Trent-class lifeboat - which entered service in 1996, remains operational.But in a statement, the charity said: "The RNLI can confirm that it remains committed to ensuring that the Shannon class all-weather lifeboat George and Frances Phelon can go on service at the station as soon as possible."The Shannon class will make a significant contribution to the charity’s mission of saving lives at sea – it has already been used extensively so that volunteers serving Norfolk and other parts of the coast have the skills they need to crew a Shannon to optimum effect."Negotiations remain under way to acquire an alternative berth for the Shannon class lifeboat to provide a safe and suitable home for the lifeboat and our volunteer crew."
Earlier in the year, the mooring for the Trent-class all-weather lifeboat Samarbeta was prohibited from being used owing to safety concerns.However, the RNLI said it was being used again."Samarbeta is operating from the mooring pen," the statement said."In particularly adverse weather conditions, alternative arrangements that follow well-practised plans, can be put in place to ensure that this lifesaving asset can continue operating."
The charity conducted  a "coast review" on 11 June, a standard procedure affecting all 238 of its lifeboat stations in the UK and Ireland every five years.The statement added: "The information [gathered] is in the process of being collated following this process."Coast Reviews focus on every element of the charity’s lifesaving service, from lifeboats, lifeguards to water safety and local fundraising by engaging with each group and listening to their views on how they and the communities they serve can be best supported by the RNLI."
