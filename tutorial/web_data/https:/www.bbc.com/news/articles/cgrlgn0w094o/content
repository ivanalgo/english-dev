A van driver "targeted" a group of revellers when he drove straight into them, a jury has heard. Four people were struck by Martin Breeze's van in Ingleby Barwick in February, with 60-year-old Brian Darby killed, Teesside Crown Court has heard.Mr Breeze, 57, and his son Shaun Breeze, 29, deny 11 offences including murder and four counts of attempted murder.Prosecutors said the group was targeted in "revenge" after they had earlier remonstrated with Shaun Breeze for riding his bike into them.
Mr Darby and his friends were walking home after an evening out at the 3 Rivers bar in Ingleby Barwick on 9 February, the court has heard.Several of the group shouted at Shaun Breeze after he rode his bike into them and chased him away at about 23:30 GMT.Minutes later, as the group walked along the footpath beside Myton Way, they were struck at speed by a Citroen Berlingo van driven by Martin Breeze, who had been called by his son, prosecutors said.Four people, including a 16-year-old boy, were struck and a fifth was narrowly missed, the court heard.Mr Darby was carried about 460ft (150m) on the front of the van and was declared dead at the scene.
In a pre-recorded interview shown to jurors, the 16-year-old boy said the van was "targeting" them."I donâ€™t think it was some accidental drink driver," the boy said. "I know it was targeted."[The van's] literally moved to hit us all and wiped us all out."He said the van was travelling normally when it suddenly changed direction towards them and the driver "put his foot down".The boy, who cannot be identified, said he went "flying in the air" and spun at least twice before landing on his head.He said in the aftermath he could hear another man hit by the van choking on his tongue, so the boy put his finger in the man's mouth to clear it and then put him in the recovery position.
The court has heard the boy and the other man suffered broken bones, a woman had life-threatening injuries and Mr Darby was killed.The boy said he could see the silhouette of the driver but it was too dark to make out their gender or appearance.Decorator Martin Breeze, of Irthing Close in Ingleby Barwick, said he accepted hitting the group but it was a "tragic accident", his lawyers have told jurors.Shaun Breeze, of Owls Grove, is accused of assisting or encouraging his father to attack the group but his lawyers said jurors should reach a conclusion based on evidence rather than "speculation".The trial continues.
