Fresh images have been released showing what Huddersfield's new market could look like after a £16.5m makeover.The market revamp is part of a wider £250m blueprint for the town centre, which also includes plans for a new library, a museum and a live entertainment venue.Kirklees Council said the market project will provide better food and drink choices and create a space to host live music, makers’ markets and community events.Former council leader Cathy Scott said: "What we’re creating here is not just a better, more vibrant traditional market for Huddersfield but also a place the local community can come together."
The redeveloped of the Northumberland Street site is also set to include an outdoor market yard, while a screen and a stage will be installed in the market hall for live performances and seasonal festivals.A public consultation on the plans is due to take place later in the year, with construction work expected to start at the beginning of next year.
Ms Scott, who was replaced as leader this week by Carole Pattison, said: “Our vision for Huddersfield is to create a town centre that not only attracts visitors but also encourages them to stay and explore more of what's on offer.“By the time we consult on all these plans later this year, we’ll be able to share more concept designs and more about how the market – particularly its versatility to support an eclectic events calendar – will run once completed.  "It’s an exciting time for the Huddersfield Blueprint, and for the future of Huddersfield.”Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
