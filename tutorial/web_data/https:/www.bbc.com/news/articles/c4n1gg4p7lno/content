A legal challenge to a traveller encampment on the A17, near Beckingham, has concluded with the land being returned to its former use, the local authority said.North Kesteven District Council said that the travellers and their caravans have moved off the land.The authority said work had taken place to remove hardcore from the site and revert the land back to agricultural use.The council said a consent order will allow them to restart legal action if residential use starts up again before the end of 2026.
Legal proceedings began in 2021 after a group of travellers set up on the site. A High Court injunction in 2022 temporarily allowed 14 caravans, pending the outcome of a planning application.The planning permission was refused and in November 2023 the caravans were removed. Work to return the site back to its original state was completed in April.Council worker Richard Wright said: â€œEffectively the case is now closed, the injunction has been discharged, an unauthorised encampment removed and the breach of planning control remedied."The council said it had responded to significant local concern and thanked the local community for their patience and support throughout the long process.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
