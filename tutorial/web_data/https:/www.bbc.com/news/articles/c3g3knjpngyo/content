Rubbish is set to be collected fortnightly in Alderney rather than weekly as part of a trial to see if refuse collections can be reduced.The States of Alderney said the trial would last six weeks in September and October.It said States Works Department research showed many islanders were recycling more, resulting in less need for general waste collection and that if all islanders recycled, a fortnightly service could be more cost efficient. The States said: "The islandâ€™s General Services Committee (GSC) believes a trial period is the best way to gauge both the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal, given that a reduction in refuse pick-up frequency may cause concern for residents."
Victoria Street, High Street and Le Huret will be excluded from the trial as the properties have limited outside space.During the trial there will be additional communal bins at waste and recycling facilities.The States said waste collection and disposal costs had "increased significantly" over the past two to three years, partly due to inflation but also as a result of increased island waste.The States Works Department and General Services Committee said they welcomed feedback and queries by emailing swd@alderney.gov.gg or calling 01481 820080.
