A mountain of rubbish dumped outside a charity shop has left its staff and volunteers angry and frustrated.Piles of discarded shoes, toys and clothing were left next to donation bins by the Salvation Army Donation Centre in West Bromwich over the weekend but staff said it was also a regular occurance.Much of the dumped items were of poor quality and unable to be sold, they added.Sandwell Council has been approached for comment.
Charity workers spent three hours trying to clear the heap which meant they had to delay the opening of the shop on Monday.The problem has happened every day for the past four years, staff said."All these shoes that were dumped, all of them are poor quality so can’t be sold and have to be ragged," assistant manager Lisa Mainwood said."We’re trying to raise money but we’re paying more out for rubbish removal."
Ms Mainwood added: “I would like the council to prosecute the culprits and let people know that we’re not a site to target, it needs to stop. “Litter Watch, a register charity made up of more than 2,400 volunteers, was set up to help keep the streets of Sandwell clean.Chief officer Alicia Wingfield said: "I pass that street every single day and my volunteers litter pick there regularly there, it has become an ongoing blight in the area.
“There is even fly tipping in trees -  settees, beds, you name it.“We’d like to see more education and more funding invested into looking after the environment as well as a recycling scheme introduced where there is an incentive to recycle.“It feels like there is no enforcement or consequences.”
