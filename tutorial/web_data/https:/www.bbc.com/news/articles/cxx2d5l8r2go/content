The wife of the injured worker said: “He is very frustrated and upset some days as he cannot communicate. “He hates the tubes everywhere.“There is still a long way to go yet.”Mr Oberdries told BBC Radio Sussex: "I put a bin in the lorry and then heard a tyre screech behind me. "Before I knew it, a van came into me and I went into the bin. If the bin wasn't there, I might not be speaking today."  
Sussex Police said they were called to an incident involving two vehicles and two pedestrians in Bucks Green, on the junction of Lynwick Street and Guildford Road on the morning of 29 May, where one man was taken to hospital.They said their investigation was still ongoing.Collisions also took place in Cowfold and Warnham, the council said. No injuries were reported at either incident, Sussex Police said. Jay Mercer, cabinet member for Environmental Health, Recycling and Waste at Horsham District Council, said: "The council is urging all drivers to be more careful and observant around waste collection vehicles."Other crew members have suffered considerable injuries and stress."As you can expect, the vehicles stop often and particularly on busy roads and crew members will be walking around them.
