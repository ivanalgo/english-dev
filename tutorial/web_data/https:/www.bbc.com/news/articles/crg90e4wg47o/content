An 82-year-old woman has been recognised with a community award after a lifetime of caring and volunteering.Glynis Rodgerson, from Saltburn-by-the-Sea, has spent 15 years volunteering at Marske Hall, having been employed at the nursing care home during her working years.As a young mother, she also fostered 62 newborn babies who needed looking after before they were adopted, many of whom she kept in touch with."I'm just doing something I enjoy," Ms Rodgerson said.
She worked at Marske Hall for most of her life, retiring in 2009 when her husband died.By 2010, she was back working at the home as a volunteer, helping residents enjoy activities.She said: "It keeps me sane these days."It's just nice to go in and have the company and know that you're doing something that's rewarding."Ms Rodgerson said the residents and staff now knew her very well."There's a resident there who says to me, 'Good morning, you've been here forever.'"
When Ms Rodgerson was about 30, she started fostering babies with the Church of England Adoption Society.Over the years she looked after 62 babies, keeping her own record of them."I just love babies," Ms Rodgerson said, but added that it was "hard going at times" when there was a baby who would not sleep.She now gets Christmas cards from the children she fostered, some who are now as far away as Australia.
Ms Rodgerson was recognised at the annual Mayor’s Community Achievement Awards held at Redcar's Civic Centre on 27 March.Her bosses at Markse Hall put her forward for the award.Volunteer coordinator Ruth Hebden said Ms Rodgerson "was one in a million".
Speaking at the ceremony, Mayor of Redcar and Cleveland Malcolm Head said: “It is a great pleasure and honour to give these much deserved awards."The biggest winners, of course, are the residents of Redcar and Cleveland, they are the ones who benefit from what you all put back into your local area, so thank you.”
Other recipients of the mayor's awards included Debi Large, the person behind Marske United FC mascot Seaside Sid, and Paul and Shirley Profit who set up the Good Life Community Project to take elderly people to allotments so they can enjoy outdoor life.
