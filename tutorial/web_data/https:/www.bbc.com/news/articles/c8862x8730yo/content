A charity fundraiser is swimming from Spurn Point to Cleethorpes later to raise money for a local children’s charity.The swim involves crossing a very busy shipping lane with strong tidal currents.Steve Stansfield said he was confident he would achieve the challenge in three hours, but it was “dependant on the currents and tides”.Mr Stansfield is raising funds for the Sunflowers Children's Action Group which supports terminally ill children and their families.
The tide will be going out when he starts the swim at 17:00 BST so the water channel will push him out to the North Sea for a while.  Mr Stansfield said: “I have to swim quite fast at that point to get across the shipping lane and then we come across flat water.“As I swim south, the tide starts coming in, which I then creep across, hopefully to land into Cleethorpes at 20:00,” he explained.Mr Stansfield said he chose the Sunflowers charity because "they create special inclusive events and activities for children who suffer from life limiting or life threatening conditions".He added: “They miss out on a lot of parties, special events and many endure harsh and painful treatments. Most have lengthy school absences and lack quality time with the families and friends."Despite undergoing open heart surgery himself, Mr Stansfield has trained for three years for the swim challenge.  He said "I am determined to achieve my goal to swim the Humber mouth and raise some much needed funds for Sunflowers Christmas party."Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
