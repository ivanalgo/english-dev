A charity is building a new monkey house in anticipation of an influx of the primates.From April 2026, it will be illegal to keep monkeys, lemurs and other primates without a licence.The Exotic Pet Refuge in Lincolnshire already has two monkey houses, accommodating 20 primates.Co-owner Pam Mansfield expects numbers to swell as people are forced to give up the creatures.
Ms Mansfield said: "We're expecting more monkeys to come to us when the new legislation comes in."The monkey house would include heated indoor areas and an outside "run", she added.The legislation, which was passed earlier this year, means that private owners of primates - such as chimpanzees, orangutans and baboons - will need to be checked by local authorities to make sure they have the right arrangements in place to properly care for the animals.
Anyone who owns a primate without the appropriate licence could face six months in jail, an unlimited fine, or both.Ms Mansfield said: "There are a lot of good owners out there. Unfortunately, there are also bad owners. I've heard of monkeys being kept in parrot cages and even rabbit hutches."These type of animals take a lot of looking after. They require adequate enclosures. People who do not have space to create these enclosures will be seeking new homes for their pets."The registered charity generates funds through six open days held each year and talks. The next open day will be held on 9 June.  In April, the same charity warned that alligators and other exotic creatures bought as "status symbols" were being given up by owners who became frightened when they grew too big.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
