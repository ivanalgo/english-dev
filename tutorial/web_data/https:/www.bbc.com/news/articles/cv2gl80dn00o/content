A community has been left "deeply disappointed" after silverware was stolen during a break-in at a church, its rector has said.The burglary at St Michaelâ€™s Church in Church Street, Framlingham, is believed to have occurred at some point overnight between Wednesday and Thursday.Suffolk Police said the offenders forced their way into the building, carrying out an untidy search and causing damage, before stealing silverware.The Reverend Chris Davey told BBC Radio Suffolk the silverware held an emotional value for many in the community.
He said the community was "hopeful" the items would be found but was being "realistic" about it.Mr Davey said: "They managed to break their way through to the safe where all our silverware was - lots and lots of it - and unfortunately, they got away with everything - all our silver chalices and plates, and the works."He said the burglary was discovered when the churchwarden went to open up at 08:30 BST on Thursday and police spent much of the day there, taking fingerprints and investigating.He said the items, including a silver processional cross, meant a lot to people, and that this would hopefully make them more identifiable."Obviously everything can be replaced but there's a deep significance to some of the stuff that was taken," he said."Today, our hope's rebuilt but we dust ourselves down and we get on with what we're called to do."Anyone with information has been asked to contact Suffolk Police.
