Miniature versions of Goole's famous "salt and pepper pots" have gone on sale as part of the town's 200th anniversary celebrations. The twin water towers, one brown and one white, are iconic in the town and have been subject to a long debate over which one is "salt" and which one is "pepper". The ceramic versions, produced by artist Deborah Frith, are available from Goole Civic Society for £25 per set.The money raised will help fund Goole's bicentenary celebrations in 2026. 
Margaret Hicks-Clarke, chairwoman of Goole Civic Society, said a vote had been held to settle the debate over which water tower represented which condiment. She said 60% of people had voted in favour of the white tower representing salt. Ms Hicks-Clarke added there had been "loads of interest" since the sale of the ceramic pots were announced on social media this week."We put it out on social media and overnight we had more than fifty applications," she said.  "We're up to about 100 so far and they just keep coming in."The Civic Society had previously announced an "epic year-long birthday bash" was planned to mark Goole's 200th anniversary including "a huge range of arts, culture and leisure events".Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
