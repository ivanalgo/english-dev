An 18th Century mill site has won a national award for architecture, after being converted into a visitor centre.Shrewsbury's Flaxmill Maltings, built in 1797 and seen as "grandparent" of the skyscraper, was among winners of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) awards recognising the UK's best new architecture.The site of the worldâ€™s first iron-frame building now includes offices, a cafe and exhibition space.It was one of 26 winners of this year's RIBA National Awards for architecture, which have been presented since 1966.
A "full refurbishment of a hugely important historic structure" into a new leisure destination had taken place, RIBA stated.
It said the area had been converted for "multiple different uses, providing a bright future for the next 100 years".Situated just outside the town centre, the site contains eight buildings "each with a unique story to tell", Shrewsbury Flaxmill Maltings said, including the 1797 main mill. RIBA stated this year's awards featured "inspiring examples of existing buildings and structures that have been given a new lease of life".This was "thanks to innovative designs, developed by working closely with clients and local communities", it added.
