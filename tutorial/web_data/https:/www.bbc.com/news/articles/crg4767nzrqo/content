A free beach information app covering all of Cornwall's 60 lifeguarded beaches is now live and available to download.The MyCoast app provides users with real time information allowing beachgoers to avoid locations with dangerous conditions, say developers.It also helps users choose the most suitable beaches for their visit, including information for those with children or accessibility needs.The MyCoast app was designed in Cornwall with the help of the RNLI and other contributors.
MyCoast founder, Jo Murray, said she decided to create the app after failing to find the information she needed to enjoy a day on the beach with her three children."MyCoast was born from my personal frustrations at simply wanting to safely take my family to the beach," she said."After several failed attempts I soon lost my confidence to explore parts of Cornwall and going to the beach became a stressful prospect. "I was determined to drive change, enabling people to ‘know before they go’, to help reduce risk and stress by providing a single point of beach information," said Ms Murray.She hopes the app will give visitors and locals the confidence to visit more of Cornwall's coastline."That's what I'm going to do with my kids this summer - go and explore other places knowing that you've got up to date information at hand," she said.Ms Murray added the aim was to roll out the app across the UK to cover all lifeguarded beaches.
