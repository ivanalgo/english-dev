A King Charles Spaniel has managed to come back from surgery on her hind legs to compete at Crufts.Amber had taken part in several competitions for a few years, but last year was diagnosed with cruciate ligament injuries.After operations, she was confined to short lead walks, no running, jumping or going upstairs.However, she was back to fitness to take part in the young handlers' agility round at Crufts on Thursday with owner Melissa Taylor, from South Ockendon, Essex.
When Amber, aged seven, got injured, Miss Taylor feared she would never be able to return to agility."Last year we found out that she had torn both of her cruciate ligaments in her back legs and she required surgery on it, and they had to put plates in her legs to stabilise her knees," said the 19-year-old."It has been a lot for her."Miss Taylor added: "She had to undergo two operations because they had to do it separately on each leg - so it was going to be a long recovery."She said the duo had seven-and-a-half months off before Amber came back to training."She has been really good, we have had to bring it up really slowly with her walks, everything."She definitely enjoys it. I love the bond you get with an agility dog because you have to work as a team."Crufts runs until Sunday at the NEC in Birmingham.
