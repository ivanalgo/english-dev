A red panda is settling "really well" into her new home in Staffordshire.Three-year-old Esha travelled to Peak Wildlife Park near Leek, Staffordshire, on Friday from her former residence at Paignton Zoo in Devon.Once established in her specially-made enclosure, she will be joined by sister Riya.Park director James Butler said Esha's arrival created "a real buzz" at the attraction.
"She's settling in really, really well," he added. "She seems to love the massive enclosure we've built especially for her and her sister.""Once she's had a bit more time to adjust, we're excited to bring Riya to join her."
Red pandas are naturally found in the forests of the eastern Himalayas and southern China and are officially classed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.The loss of nesting habitats and poaching has led to their decline in the wild.Peak Wildlife Park's purpose-built enclosure simulates a wild climate.
