Guernsey's Committee for Home Affairs is preparing a police complaints law change for debate in the States. It comes in the wake of a number of pending legal complaints against the force.A policy letter would bring some "urgent legislative amendments", including improvements to the system for both police and complainants, politicians said.Committee president Deputy Rob Prow said the current legislation was "outdated and needs updating".
The Police Complaint Commission (PCC) announced last month the way complaints about Guernsey Police were handled should be reviewed to help build public confidence.Home Affairs said the policy letter would seek to immediately improve the proportionate, effective management of complaints, and would introduce vicarious liability for police officers subject to civil legal action. Vicarious liability is a rule of law that imposes strict liability on employers for the wrongdoings of their employees.The bailiwick is currently the only part of the British Isles without such liability for police officers.
The review was also due to include consideration of reducing political involvement in the complaints process and increasing the oversight role of the Police Complaints Commission, officials said.Home Affairs said that it was aiming to make improvements to the system for both police and complainants.It added that this would address the concerns people using the system may have, while also helping police to respond to lessons learned.Deputy Prow said that public support and confidence in the police was essential.â€œWhile having a complaints system is vital to ensure the police are subject to the appropriate checks and balances, the current legislation is outdated and needs updating" he said. He added that the policy letter would bring some of the "more urgent elements" to the States for amendment very quickly.
