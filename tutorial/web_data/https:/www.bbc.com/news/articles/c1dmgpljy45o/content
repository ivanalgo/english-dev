An disused office block has been transformed into apartments for families in need of housing.West Berkshire Council has turned West Point House in Newbury, Berkshire, into five flats for refugees initially, before eventually being available to local families.The work was part of a wider project by the council to provide 27 homes across the district for families displaced by conflicts in Afghanistan and Ukraine.The apartments will be furnished and the new tenants are expected to move in later this month.
The housing project is being part-funded by central government through its Local Authority Housing Fund, which was set up to help councils manage the impact on its housing services when supporting displaced families arriving in the UK.The government has provided £3.6m towards the project, which has cost £9m in total.Once the resettlement schemes have concluded and tenants have moved into permanent accommodation, the apartments will become part of West Berkshire Council's temporary housing supply.The building includes a one-bed apartment and four, three-bed apartments.Speaking about the project, Councillor Denise Gaines, executive member for housing, said: "It's been wonderful to watch these empty offices transform into five new apartments for families in need of a place to call home. "It will give them a sense of belonging and a place of their own as they continue to rebuild their lives in West Berkshire. "Having visited recently the apartments look great and I hope the new tenants will be very happy there."
