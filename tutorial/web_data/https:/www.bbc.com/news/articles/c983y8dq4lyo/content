Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are to be renamed as "National Landscapes".The National Landscapes team said this was to highlight the importance of natural sites.The Mendip Hills of Somerset was included in the list of areas, and by 2030 it aimed to have actions in place towards its tree planting targets.The selected areas reportedly benefit the country by restoring the ecosystem, providing food, storing carbon and safeguarding against drought.
National Landscapes said 66% of people lived within 30 minutes of one of the sites and 170 million people visit them each year. Jim Hardcastle, the Mendip Hills National Landscape Manager said: "We have a new name and logo... but this is still the same beautiful place where people live and work and come to breathe."The name should grab people's attention and remind them how importance the area is."
