Victims of crimes are being offered the chance to speak to police officers digitally after a force introduced a video call service.Dorset Police has established the Enhanced Video Response (EVR) initiative at its stations.It gives victims the option to interact with officers over video calls, however in-person services will also still be available.The system was trialled during four-months last summer and "89% of victims who took part said they would recommend it to others," said Assistant Chief Constable Steve Lyne.
He also noted that "the number of victims who withdrew their support for a prosecution halved"."We know that for many, they prefer the convenience of speaking to us over a video call where they can engage more openly, and they donâ€™t feel anxious at the thought of a police car outside their home address," Assistant Chief Constable Lyne added.Dorset Police said that using EVR for taking statements and carrying out enquiries has increased efficiency for the force and reduced vehicle costs, as there is less need for officers to travel.
Toni used the service after an incident of domestic violence.She said the video call was beneficial to her at a time when she felt vulnerable.She said: "At the time, where I was very scared, very frightened, very upset, I didn't want anyone in my home."My home is my safe place. It's my sanctuary."Reflecting on her video call with Dorset Police she said: "It gave me an element of control back that I hadn't had for quite some time."And having the police officer on screen and in front of me, it meant it was a real person, it wasn't just a voice at the end of a phone."
Speaking from the launch of the new service in Bournemouth, Ch Supt Gavin Dudfield said officers will ask a set of questions to the victim and assess whether a virtual response would be "beneficial to the victim".He added that the service has already been used for victims of assaults, criminal damage and harassment. "More serious offences where there is an immediate threat, risk and harm, when we need officers there now, will not be considered for an EVR," he said.
