Residents have said a foul stench thought to be from a nearby quarry is still in the air and affecting people’s health.Ashcourt Quarry at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, was identified by the Environment Agency in 2023 as being the source of a methane smell. An investigation is ongoing after it issued an enforcement notice to the site in February, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.But the Ashcourt Group said a recent test for gas emissions did not raise any concerns and it was capping a large section of the landfill on the site. 
One resident Stewart Hodgson said: "Why should anyone have to live life breathing in toxic air and a smell that turns your stomach."Darlington Borough Council, is calling for a "quick solution" to the problem which is affecting people in Newton Aycliffe and surrounding villages.Deputy leader of the council, Chris McEwan, said: "We appreciate that there are still incidents of odour affecting communities within the borough and these were prevalent recently with the colder weather and wind direction from the north."A spokesperson for Ashcourt added: "We are aware that there are odours emanating from different businesses in the local area and believe that the Environment Agency is conducting inquiries."
The Environment Agency said a fixed odour monitoring unit had been installed in Brafferton, a village one mile (1.6kms)  from the quarry.  Area environment manager Gary Wallace said: "We understand how unpleasant the odour issues are for the community and we’re committed to ensuring the operator takes the necessary action to control the gas emissions from the site."We continue to assess the site regularly and an investigation into any breaches of the site’s environmental permit is ongoing," he added.
