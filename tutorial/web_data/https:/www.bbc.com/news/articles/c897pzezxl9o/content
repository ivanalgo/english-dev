A council will consider introducing car parking fees in market towns in a bid to ease "budget pressures".Breckland Council in Norfolk, which owns 30 car parks, said operating and maintenance costs were costing its taxpayers about £450,000 per year.Market towns affected include Attleborough, Dereham, Swaffham, Thetford and Watton.Paul Hewett, a Conservative councillor and executive member for property, projects and procurement, said the council needed to take a "fresh look" at how car parks were funded.
"In the case of our car parks, introducing a paid parking system - funded by those who benefit most from it - feels like the fairest, and most affordable way to do this," he said."Evidence also suggests that this approach could also result in an increase in footfall, and importantly trade, for local businesses in our market towns by encouraging a greater turnover of spaces."Similar plans by the council in 2012 led to an online petition and concerns about shoppers avoiding high streets.
The council said it had commissioned an independent report and feasibility study that recommended the changes.If approved, each market town would have one car park offering the first hour's parking for free, with tariffs between 50p and £1 for the first chargeable hour."We recognise money is tight for many people right now, so this is not an easy decision, but by charging just a small fee for parking we would not only protect our public car parking facilities for the long term, but also our ability to invest in other vital community services," Mr Hewett added.The proposals will be put before the council's cabinet on 15 July.
