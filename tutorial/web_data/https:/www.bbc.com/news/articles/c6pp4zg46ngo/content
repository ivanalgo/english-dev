A historian has described how the inspiration for one of the main characters in fantasy drama House of the Dragon spent time living at Oxford Castle.The HBO series - a prequel to Game of Thrones and based on George RR Martin's novel - depicts Rhaenyra Targaryen's battle for the Iron Throne.This is strikingly similar to Empress Matilda's attempts to claim the English throne in the 12th Century.Historian Katherine Newman, an expert in medieval history and who works at Oxford Castle and Prison, said Matilda took refuge at the site during a civil war - known as the Anarchy - and even took part in a daring escape from the medieval fortress.
"Both Matilda and Rhaenyra proved themselves to be resourceful and brilliant leaders," she said."George RR Martin's tale is widely known to be inspired by Matilda's story but it's not widely acknowledged that Oxford Castle and Prison was her home."The site still bares features today [of] Matilda's 12th Century residency, including a window in St George's Tower from which she infamously escaped using knotted bedsheets and the support of loyal knights to slip past enemy forces close to capturing her."Like Game of Thrones was inspired by the Wars of the Roses, its prequel takes elements from an earlier time - the Anarchy."It was a bloody civil war sparked by the death of King Henry I and the contentious issue of his rightful heir. The similarities are uncanny."
Among those similarities between Matilda and Rhaenyra Targaryen are that they were both made heirs by their royal fathers in societies that disapproved of female rulers. Both then started a civil war over their claims to the throne, with the two campaigns ending in a similar manner.Matildaâ€™s rival for the throne, Stephen, had been pursuing her when she found herself besieged at Oxford Castle during the winter of 1142. In a bid to retain her crown, Matilda defended the castle from his forces before finally making her escape as the enemy encircled. According to legend, she was wearing white to camouflage in the December snow and escaped by skating along the frozen River Thames after making her way down the tower.The stars of the House of the Dragon spoke to the BBC about what fans can expect in the latest series ahead of its release this weekend.
