BBC racing commentator John Hunt has urged people to "make the most of every day" after a crossbow attack that killed three of his family members, his friend said.Carol Hunt, 61, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, were fatally injured at their home in Bushey, Hertfordshire, on 9 July.Fellow commentator Matt Chapman said proceeds from a fundraiser set up after the attack would support Mr Hunt's surviving daughter, Amy."Family means more to some than others and for John, his family unit was something he absolutely adored," Mr Chapman said.
Kyle Clifford, 26, from Enfield, north London, was arrested on Thursday evening on suspicion of three counts of murder.Hertfordshire Constabulary said on Monday that he remained injured in hospital and had yet to be questioned.
More than Â£28,000 has been collected since the fundraiser was launched, along with hundreds of messages of support.Mr Chapman said Mr Hunt had told him his "biggest desire" was to ensure Amy had "no money worries for the rest of her life"."There are a lot of people, including myself, who feel helpless and would like to do something," he told the BBC."John would like nothing more for Amy after these horrific events than a life that is a little less stressful, because life will never be stress-free again."It's not going to take their grief away - it's not going to take the pain away or change anything - but it might help them have an easier life."
Mr Chapman, an ITV commentator, said he had been in frequent contact with the "very talented" Mr Hunt following last week's events."He told me: 'Matty, the message I would tell everyone is you never know when it's going to be the last day you see your family'," Mr Chapman said."The message was very clear: make the most of every day because you just don't know."Mr Chapman added that during phone calls to Mr Hunt, he would often be at home and "you could feel that family life in the background".In a statement released on Saturday, Mr Hunt and Amy said their devastation "cannot be put into words".They thanked people for their "kind messages" which had provided "great comfort".
Det Supt Rob Hall, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, previously said the investigation was moving at pace.A crossbow was found on Thursday as inquiries continued, police said.A vigil held at St James' Church that day saw more than 50 people attend to pay their respects.
