A man has been jailed for six weeks after stalking a woman and leaving her with a "constant feeling of fear and uncertainty". Peter Milner, of Kenton Drive in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, pleaded guilty to bombarding his victim with messages. He also saved photos from her social media to his own devices between September and November last year. After the woman blocked him, he began contacting her friends and even made a false welfare report to police about her, claiming she was being held hostage. His intrusive behaviour continued until March, police said. The "obsessive" 51-year-old was also given a seven year restraining order and was sentenced at Bristol Crown Court on Wednesday. 
His "continuous harassment" began after the pair met through volunteering work.  In a statement read in court, the victim said: "His behaviour extended to extreme measures of making false welfare reports about me to the police, telling them that I was being held hostage and I was being prevented from speaking to him. "I found this particularly worrying as it showed he had no concept of reality."Following the false reports, officers visited the woman's home and later updated Milner on her welfare. "My sense of safety I once took for granted, vanished, replaced by a constant feeling of fear and uncertainty," she added. 
PC Michael Land, of Wiltshire Police, said: "Stalking is an intrusive crime and we take reports very seriously. "Victims are endlessly harassed, their private lives are completely intruded and the lasting impact on a victim can be life changing."I hope this sentence gives other victims encouragement and belief that they will be listened to and by working with the police they can help stop this impactful behaviour."
