Fewer than five people from Guernsey died because of infected blood, according to new figures released by the States.Deputy Al Brouard, chairman of the Health and Social Care Committee (HSC), also said fewer than 10 infected blood victims had received support from HSC.The figures were released following a written question from Deputy Lester Queripel using Rule 14 of the States' rules of procedure.Mr Brouard said the States would work with the next UK government to help secure compensation for local victims of the infected blood scandal.
He said a UK compensation scheme had been rushed through the British parliament before the UK general election was called for July, but this had meant "government officials did not have opportunity to undertake the full, detailed policy work before the progression of the bill" in May.Mr Brouard said the States would work with the next UK government to understand how compensation would affect victims from Guernsey.He said people who had contracted Hepatitis C or HIV had received on-island treatment from the island's Orchard Centre and a consultant virologist.Islanders who were concerned they may have been infected were being offered free screening at the Orchard Centre, he added.
