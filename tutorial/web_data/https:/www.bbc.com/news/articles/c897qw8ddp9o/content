Schoolchildren may be unknowingly smoking vapes spiked with the drug spice, an investigation by the University of Bath has found.Spice, a synthetic street drug, can cause a wide range of dangerous side effects, including cardiac arrest.Out of 596 confiscated vapes tested across 38 schools in England, one in six (16.6%) contained it, the study found.Prof Chris Pudney, who conducted the tests, said: "Headteachers are telling me pupils are collapsing in the halls and ending up with long stays in intensive care.”
He added: "Teenagers think they are purchasing vapes or vape fluid containing THC or nicotine when, in fact, they are laced with spice. "We know children can have cardiac arrests when they smoke spice, and I believe some have come quite close to death."
Prof Pudney used the world’s first portable device which instantly detects synthetic drugs to do the tests.The study also found roughly 1 in 100 (1.17%) of vapes tested contained THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis.In total, 38 schools from across London, the West Midlands, Greater Manchester and South Yorkshire took part in the research.Prof Pudney has deployed a spice detector to Devon and Cornwall Police.Chf Insp Sarah Johns said the device would help police ascertain the scale of the issue there.“Young people obtaining these fluids, or being offered them, will never be able to know for sure what’s in them and as Dr Pudney’s work indicates, if its spice then that could lead to serious harm,” she said.
Ben Davis, headteacher at St Ambrose Barlow RC High School in Salford, said there had been instances of pupils under the influence of spice."I recall one young man describing how his hands felt like cartoon hands. We’ve also witnessed two children collapsing.“Dealing with the aftermath is challenging, especially when you have to explain to the child’s family that something potentially life-threatening happened while they were in our care," he added.Det Sgt Laura Bell, of Greater Manchester Police, added that it was important to take a “proactive approach” and engage with young people and schools.“We encourage parents and guardians to discourage their children from getting involved in any illegal activities and continue to remind them of the negative consequences that using drugs can have," she said.Areas where schools or police have issued safety warnings include Cornwall, Devon, Kent, Lincolnshire, Lancashire, London, Middlesbrough, Somerset and the West Midlands.Prof Pudney will publish an academic paper on his vape testing findings.
Sarah MacFadyen, of Asthma + Lung UK, said the results of the study were “deeply concerning” and called for “proper regulation and enforcement” of e-cigarette laws.“If you’re a smoker and you want to quit tobacco, vaping can be a helpful way to give up smoking. But for children and those who don’t smoke, starting to vape is not recommended, especially if you have a lung condition,” she said.“We are concerned about the recent rise in teenagers vaping and want to see a ban on disposable vapes, as their attractive packaging and flavouring, and pocket-money prices, are particularly appealing to children.”
