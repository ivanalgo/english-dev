A new mental health service has helped hundreds of people its first three months, organisers say.The Bothy in Ashington provides support for anyone experiencing a mental health crisis in Northumberland and does not require a GP referral.The so-called "safe-haven" has seen 158 people use its services since 1 April and is  the first of its kind in the North East, according to Northumberland County Council.Pasha Tanriverdi, the head of development at Everyturn Mental Health, which runs the service, said the number of users had been "increasing each month". 
Operating every day from14:00 to 22:00, the project is supported by the county council and Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust (CNTW). People can drop into The Bothy or get in touch online, where they can receive a listening ear, help arranging appointments or a safety plan, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reports.
Northumberland County Council cabinet member for adult social care, Wendy Pattison, said she had been concerned about residents suffering with mental health issues, anxiety and depression after the Covid-19 pandemic."By chance, I found an article online about safe havens in East Sussex. I thought they were an amazing thing, that people are able to walk into a safe haven and get advice from mental health professionals without having to be referred by a doctor," she said."We have the very first safe haven in the North East here in Northumberland. It is absolutely phenomenal and I can’t thank everyone enough."
Jane Walker, Northumberland and North Tyneside's head of mental health at the ICB, called the service "important" for people who fell "through the gap in services"."The services offer support to people who identify as being in crisis, but don't meet the threshold for traditional crisis services," she said.Ms Walker added that it also eased "pressure" on other services.
