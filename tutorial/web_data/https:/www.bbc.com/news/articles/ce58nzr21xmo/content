The family of Muriel McKay said they were trying to persuade police and government officials to allow her killer into the UK from Trinidad to help unearth her body.A police search for Mrs McKay’s remains began on Monday at Stocking Farm in Hertfordshire, where she was held hostage and murdered in 1969.Her family said one of the two men convicted of her murder, Nizamodeen Hosein, told them where she was buried and was poised to travel to the UK to point out the spot.The Metropolitan Police said it had "carefully considered" bringing Hosein over, but did not believe that would provide "any further or useful information", while the Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases.
Mrs McKay, 55, was held to ransom for £1m at a farm in Hertfordshire by two brothers who had mistaken her for Anna Murdoch, the then-wife of newspaper tycoon Rupert Murdoch.She was taken to Rooks Farm – now Stocking Farm in Stocking Pelham, near Stanstead – where she was later killed.Arthur and Nizamodeen Hosein were convicted of Mrs McKay’s kidnap and murder, and while Arthur died in prison, Nizamodeen was later deported to Trinidad.The case appeared to be closed, but in 2021, Nizamodeen featured in a documentary seen by Mrs McKay’s family.“Here was an opportunity – he seemed to be willing to open up”, recalled Mrs McKay’s daughter Dianne.She flew to Trinidad with her son Mark Dyer and spoke at length with Nizamodeen, who pointed to the spot where he claimed she was buried.
On Thursday, Dianne visited the dig at Stocking Farm along with her brother Ian and son Mark."I'm full of hope, I really hope we’re going to find her," she said."The one who buried her - we need him here. And as he’s still alive and talking... I think he should be here."Mr Dyer told the BBC that Nizamodeen "could be here any time, most likely on Friday".Mrs McKay’s son Ian visited the farm for the first time on Tuesday, and believes it is  "a no-brainer" for Nizamodeen to attend the dig."The only element which is missing is Nizam," he said."He should be at least trotted out, even if for two hours, and sent back to the airport."
Police searched the farm in 1970 and again in 2022. Detectives also visited Nizamodeen in Trinidad in March and despite concerns about "inconsistencies in his accounts", said they would carry out this "final search for completeness".In a statement released on Thursday, the Metropolitan Police said: "We are investing significant time and resource in this search and we all share a desire to find Muriel’s remains and bring some closure to her family."The team are searching the area that has been identified from all their extensive inquiries, including speaking to Hosein and Muriel’s family."Bringing Hosein to the UK has been carefully considered and we do not believe it would provide us with any further or useful consistent information. Therefore we have not formally approached the Home Office, who would be required to grant permission."
The Home Office told the BBC that anyone who has been deported from the UK needs to first apply for a revocation of their deportation order and then apply for permission to visit.A spokesperson said: “Our sympathies remain with Muriel McKay’s loved ones.“Whilst it is our longstanding position that we do not routinely comment on individual cases, we work with the police on any requests pertaining to ongoing investigations.”
