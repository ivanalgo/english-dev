In York Outer, the newly elected Labour MP polled 23,161 votes compared to Mr Sturdy's 13,770, while Reform UK's John Crispin-Bailey came third with 5,912 votes.Mr Sturdy said his party’s defeat was the result of a split in the centre-right vote following Reform UK’s gains.
The outgoing MP said: “The winds of political change have swept through, Keir Starmer will get into Number 10 and the Conservatives have to recognise that.“It’s important that we now have a strong opposition to take the country forward.”Declaring his win as a "historic moment for Harrogate and Knaresborough, the country and the Liberal Democrats", Mr Gordon said: "We are back"."Back in Harrogate and Knaresborough, back in Yorkshire and back right across our country."He defeated former Conservative MP Andrew Jones by more than 8,000 votes.
Elsewhere, Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake kept his seat in Thirsk and Malton, securing 19,544 votes.Despite a 23% cut in vote share compared to the 2019 general election Mr Hollinrake said he was “fantastically enthusiastic” about being re-elected.He said, despite the results, there was “still an appetite for Conservatism” and that his party “needs to go away, lick its wounds, decide how we rebuild [with] a new leader and a new offering to the people”.Meawhile, Labour's Rachael Maskell retained her seat in York Central, picking up 24,537 votes, which equated to more than 56% of all votes cast.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
