Fourteen beach huts that had to be moved from a beach due to erosion six years ago are to be put back in place.The huts were among 44 that had to be lifted away from their original sand platforms near Spa Pavilion in Felixstowe, Suffolk, due to storm damage in 2018.They were transferred to the Promenade while consultations with owners and East Suffolk Council was ongoing.Paul Ashton, cabinet member for assets and corporate services, said he believed these huts could be "sited without a negative impact". 
Final approval for the move, enabling owners to build new wooden platforms to reinstate the huts near Spa Pavilion, was given on Tuesday."While finding a solution for the remaining 14 huts, we have considered the impact of the wooden frameworks on other beach users and the beach scene in winter when the huts will be moved to the promenade," Mr Ashton said."Lots of empty frameworks would have detracted from the heritage value of the sea front."Mr Ashton added that rising sea levels and "more severe weather events" could pose challenges in the future but the council would work with hut owners to find solutions."Beach huts are an important part of seaside history and a key part of Felixstoweâ€™s heritage," he added. New locations had also been found for 30 huts, including at Manor End, The Dip, Pier South and a new beach site at Clifflands. The council said approval would be subject to a number of conditions, including "continued oversight through partnership working, mitigation and coastal management monitoring".
