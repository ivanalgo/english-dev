A motorbike rider and passenger killed in a crash which also claimed the lives of two young girls alongside their parents have been named.Christopher and Janine Barton died when the bike was involved in a collision with a car on the A61 between Wakefield and Barnsley on Sunday, West Yorkshire Police said.Nine-year-old Rubie Morgan-Roller and four-year-old Lillie Morgan-Roller were also killed alongside their mother Shannen Morgan and father Shane Roller.The family were all travelling in a Ford Focus when the crash happened between Staincross and Newmillerdam at about 15:55 BST.
Mr Barton, 56, and Mrs Barton, 48, had recently celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary.In a tribute issued by West Yorkshire Police, their son described the couple, who lived in Barnsley, as “a loving, caring mum and dad who always put me before everything else”.The A61 remains closed following the crash, while forensic teams examine the scene.Earlier, the father of Mr Roller described his son and Ms Morgan as an "amazing" mum and dad.In a social media post he said: "On Sunday we lost part of our family, Shane Roller, Shannen Morgan and two beautiful little granddaughters in a terrible car accident."Shane wasn't just a son but an amazing father and he had a heart of gold ."Shannen, our daughter-in-law, was funny and was also an amazing mum and they thought the world of their little family."
He added: "They will be very much missed by everyone that knew them but they will always be in our hearts and thoughts forever."Fly high and stay safe together."Love you more than words can say."The couple's eldest daughter, aged 11, was not with the family, who lived in Barnsley, when the accident happened.More than £300,000 has been raised for her in 48 hours after a GoFundMe campaign was set up by family friend Paul Hepple.Mr Hepple said the youngster had "lost her whole world in an instant" and the donations would "ensure she has a stable, loving environment where she can heal and grow".
Paul Gorner, from Junior Tykes FC, said the family had been watching one of their daughters play in a match on Saturday, the day before the crash.Mr Gorner said the club would be arranging a match or tournament to help raise money for the girl.In a statement, Clare Storr and Kirsty Wordsworth, co-head teachers of Athersley North Primary School, which Rubie and Lillie attended, said the girls were "a delight to teach".“The girls were a credit to their parents, who were always incredibly supportive and who will also be greatly missed," they said.
Hundreds of people had already visited St Helen's Church in Athersley on Tuesday to pay their respects, Father Peter Needham told the BBC"The rest of our society is filled with noise and activity," he said. "This is not a time for noise and activity, it is a time for stillness."A special service will take place at 10:00 BST on Wednesday which would be "spiritually honouring" the six people who lost their lives in the crash, he added.West Yorkshire Police has asked anyone with information about the crash or dashcam footage to get in touch with them.
