Locals have objected to draft plans to build 150 homes on a green space near a town centre.Eastern Way playing fields in Daventry have been earmarked for a housing development as part of West Northamptonshire Council's master plan for the town centre.  Residents said if the development went ahead, it would "completely stop" numerous community events.The council said the masterplan would provide "much-needed investment and improvements to Daventry’s green spaces" while "reinventing the market town experience".
The masterplan proposes improvements to Daventry town centre, including "newer homes and urban greenery" alongside a "village green space" in Eastern Way.It proposes "a wide range of homes for town centre living and to support the housing needs of the town’s varied demographic".It also states there will be "senior living" facilities on the site.The fields are currently used for community activities including dog-walking, a Parkrun and as a circus venue.Elizabeth Scott, a local resident of seven years, said: "You can really see the enjoyment [the community] get from it, but the development will stop it completely." She said what concerned her more about the council's masterplan was that "social structures" in Daventry were not in place, and that the town could "barely cope" the number of residents now.Another resident, Louise Spankhurst, said the fields were "very important" to the community. 
Dan Lister, Conservative cabinet member for local economy, culture and leisure at the council, said: "The new masterplan will provide much-needed investment and improvements to Daventry’s green spaces while reinventing the market town experience in Daventry."There is broadly strong support for many of the proposals outlined within the Masterplan; however Eastern Way has received the least positive response."The evaluation of the public consultation and suggested next steps for the Daventry Masterplan will be considered by West Northamptonshire Council’s cabinet this autumn."
