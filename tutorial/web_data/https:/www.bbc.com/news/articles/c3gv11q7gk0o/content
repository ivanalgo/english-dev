Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa has come face to face with his waxwork doppelganger as it was unveiled at Madame Tussauds in London.In a video capturing the meeting between the Scottish actor and his wax clone, the 31-year-old was left shocked and giggling at the uncanny likeness."Oh God. It's the teeth. The teeth are so accurate," Gatwa said as he studied the statue.The 15th Doctor's waxwork will be open for the public to view from Friday.
Gatwa, who made his name as one of the stars of Netflix hit Sex Education, worked with artists from Madame Tussauds to get his body measurements, head shape and eye colour correct, before giving his final approval to the likeness in May.The waxwork will be part of the new film and TV-themed zone at the Baker Street attraction, which also features James Bond, E.T and Millie Bobby Brown's Enola Holmes.Russell T Davies, the current Doctor Who showrunner, who led the 2005 revival of the series, visited the final set for the official unveiling.
Gatwa was born in Rwanda in 1992, during the country's civil war. His family fled to the UK when he was two and he grew up first in Edinburgh, then in Dunfermline.The waxwork shows Gatwa dressed in one of his outfits from the series, which featured in the first episode called Space Babies.Gatwa first appeared as the time-traveling alien in the last of the three 60th anniversary episodes alongside Scottish actor David Tennant, who has played the Doctor twice.
This is not the first time Madame Tussauds has had a brush with the two-hearted Time Lord.The attraction was featured in the Third Doctor, Jon Pertwee's 1970 episode called the Spearhead from Space, in which he battled plastic dummies called the Autons.Ten years later, the fourth Doctor, played by Tom Baker, was the first to have his likeness recreated in wax.Jodie Whittaker, who played the 13th incarnation of the Gallifreyan, has also been recreated by the museum.
