A cinema screen in Bradford has reopened following a year-long closure. The screen, named the Cubby Broccoli after the James Bond films producer, was shut as part of the National Science and Media Museum's refurbishment.It is the only one of three screens to reopen at the museum's Pictureville Cinema, with the others remaining shut due to ongoing works to fix crumbling concrete.The museum has also remained closed, so access to Cubby Broccoli will be through the back entrance.
In celebration of the reopening, the screen would show a "specially curated summer film programme", a museum spokesperson said.This would include a Marlon Brando centenary celebration, with showings of his famous works, and a season of "classic long, hot summer films".The National Science and Media Museum said more information about the reopening of the other two screens would be shared "soon".The museum itself is undergoing a full remodel ahead of Bradford's year as UK City of Culture in 2025.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
