Climate change campaigners hope an exhibition featuring a giant illuminated globe on the Isle of Man will encourage residents to live in a more sustainable way. Gaia, which is 20ft (6m) in diameter and features NASA imagery of the Earth from space, can be seen at St Thomas' Church in Douglas until 12 May. Aly Lewin from Net Zero Isle of Man said she hoped people would feel "empowered to take action" after visiting the display, which also coincides with Earth Day on 22 April. Vicar of St Thomas' Church Reverend Liz Hull said she had found viewing the installation along with its bespoke soundtrack "very moving". 
Artist Luke Jerram also previously said he wanted the artwork to help people have conversations "to make our society and our lives more sustainable".
