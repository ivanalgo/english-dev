Welsh Water has been warned it risks prosecution after a damning new report highlighted its worst-ever performance last year. Natural Resources Wales' (NRW) latest annual review, published Tuesday, outlined the company's further decline against the standards set across Wales and England.It was responsible for a total of 107 sewage pollution incidents during 2023, while "serious pollution events" like the sewer pipe which burst into the River Taff at Pontypridd in March, rose from five to seven in the past year. Welsh Water said it was "disappointed with the assessment" and acknowledged "our performance is not where we want it to be".
The report also flagged concerns about a small but significant decline in water discharge permit compliance, dropping to 98%.However, improvements were made to the number of pollution incidents self-reported to NRW, rising to 70% during 2023 but still falling short of the minimum 80% target.Water companies are expected to self-report incidents to NRW before others do, and without a rapid response the impact of pollution can escalate and the opportunity to act is lost.As a result Welsh Water will retain at a two-star rating in 2024 - meaning improvement is required - with NRW warning the company it needs to turn things around.
Clare Pillman, chief executive of NRW said: “Despite increased pressure from ourselves as regulators, and from politicians and the public, Welsh Water have failed to make the kind of improvements we want and expect to see.“It is unacceptable that we are now seeing a year-on-year increase in significant pollution incidents, at a time where so much is being invested in improving our rivers and water quality for nature and people.“In response, we continue to use all the enforcement tools available to us to drive improvements."She added NRW was "pursuing several formal investigations, including potential prosecutions relating to incidents and issues of permit compliance" and that it was "absolutely committed to seeing them through.”
Welsh Water said: "We are disappointed with the assessment rating and acknowledge that our performance is not where we want it to be.“We take environmental responsibility seriously and apologise for any environmental harm we have caused and are working tirelessly to deliver the improvements required in challenging circumstances."It added climate change and severe weather events had "an increasing impact on our infrastructure and is challenging how we deliver our services".The NRW report also focused on the other water company operating in Wales, Hafren Dyfrdwy.Part of the Severn Trent group, it provides wastewater services to some mid and northern border counties here.Due to its small operating area Hafren Dyfrdwy did not receive a star rating and its performance was said to have has improved from the previous year, despite some non-compliance issues and one low-level sewerage incident.A consultation with water companies and other relevant stakeholders will be held over the summer.
