Fares will be cut on a rail line that has suffered repeated delays and breakdowns since it opened a year ago. Merseyrail will cut prices on the Headbolt Lane line at the weekends in a bid to get more people on board. City region bosses are subsidising the cut-price fares with money claimed back from train manufacturer Stadler. Adults can travel from Headbolt Lane in Kirkby and Fazakerley in Liverpool to the city centre for £2, while child fares will be £1.Liverpool city region mayor Steve Rotheram said he hoped the gesture showed passengers' patient was appreciated. 
The Headbolt Lane line is now back up to a four trains an hour service after nine months at reduced services. Mr Rotheram said: “The new Headbolt Lane station is a fantastic new, fully accessible facility delivered by an £80m investment by the Combined Authority. "There have been a few teething issues with the new trains serving it, so I wanted to make a gesture of goodwill to thank people for sticking with us.“As promised, the performance of the trains has been much better of late and should only continue to improve, offering the world class service local people deserve for years to come."
