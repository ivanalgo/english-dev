Councillor David Gray, cabinet member for environment and planning, said the scheme "plays a crucial role"."The new facilities will not only make public transport and sustainable travel options more accessible, but also play a crucial role in reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality in Cheltenham and Gloucester," he said.Kier, which was awarded the construction contract, started work on phase 2 in May 2023.Regional director at Kier Construction Western & Wales, Andy Bolas said: "This state-of-the-art hub will provide a welcome boost to sustainable transport links in Cheltenham, and we look forward to seeing it being used for years to come."
