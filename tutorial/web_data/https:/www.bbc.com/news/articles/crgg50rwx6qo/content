The co-founder of a school due to close this summer said he hoped the site would reopen for SEND pupils.The Saxmundham Free School in Suffolk opened in 2012 for pupils aged between 11 and 16.Last year, Seckford Education Trust (SET) announced the school would close due to dwindling pupil numbers. Ofsted rated it as inadequate in 2022.Simon Eyre, one of the founding partners, said he hoped a new school for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) could be established on the plot.
In March, it was announced that a new SEND school would be opened in East Suffolk.Mr Eyre said: "It is sad that the school is not able to continue but I have heard rumours that it may be used for special educational needs, which would be good because the key is that it leaves a legacy behind for the community."
Mr Eyre, who is no longer connected to the school, said he was proud of its original ethos to combine the best aspects of state and private education."We all as parents wanted more of a classic education to be taught at the school and certainly in the first few years it did achieve that," he recalled."The Saxmundham Free School did really well, not just helping its own pupils but encouraging other schools in the area to look at what they were doing, pull their socks up and to improve the way they were delivering education."And I think the exceptional standard we now have at Alde Valley Academy in Leiston is a perfect example of that."It was unfortunate for the free school that it started to lose pupils, but the outcomes for children as a whole in the area have been positive."SET previously said Saxmundham School was shutting due to a "considerable decline" in pupil numbers, with just 14 new starters expected in Year 7 in September 2023.A drop to under 200 would mean a "well-rounded education" could not be provided.There are 222 pupils on register - according to the government website - despite capacity for 600.The trust pledged to work with other schools, as well as Suffolk County Council  and the Department for Education (DfE), to find alternative places for pupils.
SET was approached again for comment.A spokeswoman for the DfE said she could not comment on whether a SEND school would be set up at the site, but said 201 special free schools are either open or are being planned."Once open, these special free schools will have total capacity of over 21,000 places."Annual investment of Â£850m is going to councils to create new SEND places and in alternative provision in mainstream and special schools."
