The owners of a shoe business hit by flooding nine months ago hope to reopen next year after experiencing a series of frustrating setbacks.Dave and Donna Hammond, of Castle Shoes in Framlingham, Suffolk, had to dispose of 3,000 pairs of shoes after Storm Babet devastated their rented premises.Building work is due to begin in September but the couple are still waiting for an insurance pay-out for their stock losses.East Suffolk Council said it had "earmarked a Resilience Emergency Response Fund of £500,000, designed to be immediately available to town and parish councils as grants", in the event of future emergencies.
Mr Hammond said: "The insurance claim for our stock is still up in the air so we have no funds to buy shoes right now, and I'm constantly chasing for answers and updates, but we are just hitting a brick wall."This site has been a shoe shop for 100 years and customers are used to it being here. They look for it to be here and we want it to be here. It's where it belongs."The Hammonds said missing the important summer trading period for school sales would be a blow but they were determined to start up again at the site as soon as possible.Mrs Hammond said: "It's been a devastating experience but we never say never and we are now aiming to reopen in early 2025."We're hoping to put in an order for shoes this autumn to be ready for the spring and summer season next year."In East Suffolk, 385 properties were flooded during Storm Babet, and affected property owners were able to apply for up to £5,000 to support specific work to make homes and businesses more resilient in future An East Suffolk Council spokesperson said: "Last October we established the East Suffolk Flood Recovery Group, which provided a physical presence in Framlingham and Wickham Market to assist and deal with affected residents' inquiries and clean up in the aftermath.“East Suffolk Services also provided a number of vehicles and staff to assist with the clearance of houses and businesses."In addition, the council said it would be employing a dedicated East Suffolk Emergency Response Co-ordinator who will work with local, county and national organisations to enhance "our preparedness and resilience"."Through the government's Flood Recovery Framework, affected households and businesses could apply for grants to assist with initial recovery costs and may have been eligible for a 100% discount to council tax or business rates for a minimum of three months."
