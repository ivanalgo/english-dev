A campaign group trying to save a 1970s theatre has applied for government funding to refurbish its auditorium to host theatre, cinema and live music events.The Amulet Theatre, in Shepton Mallet, was built in 1975 as a "state-of-the-art" space, but closed in 2022 before being placed on an at-risk list.Community group Let's Buy The Amulet want to save the building and re-open it as a working theatre.The theatre could be awarded a share of £5m from the government's levelling up fund to give it a new lease of life.
Matt Harrison, from Shepton Mallet Town Council, said the levelling up fund bid had "come at a critical juncture".In March, the government announced £5m of capital funding for the former Mendip area, including Shepton Mallet.Shepton Town Council has now formally asked Somerset Council to use this funding on the Amulet Theatre, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Mr Harrison, town council chair, said it would be "completely transformational" for the town.“Shepton Mallet has no theatre, no cinema, no leisure centre, no tourist information centre and no banks – it doesn’t even have a town hall," he said.“I understand the Mendip towns are understandably vying for this money, but what matters here is the biggest impact on the most culturally under-served conurbation in the Mendips – Shepton Mallet."
Councillor Federica Smith-Roberts, portfolio holder for communities, housing and culture, said the council was in the process of putting together a list of projects eligible for funding.“It is a really interesting and exciting time in relation to the capital funding we’ve received of £5m to spend on cultural projects in Mendip," she said.“We have a process in place to deliver a potential list of projects which could benefit from this funding.”
