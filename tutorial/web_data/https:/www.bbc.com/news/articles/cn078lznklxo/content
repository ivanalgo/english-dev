Work on a new medical centre for a growing village is due to begin at the start of next month.An increasing number of new homes have been built in Rackheath near Norwich, with almost 4,000 more proposed.Broadland District Councillor Fran Whymark said there was “a desperate need” for the health hub.Darwin Group, which is building the NHS medical centre, said construction work would begin on 5 August and should be complete in spring next year.
Writing to residents, the company’s head of project delivery, Daniel Bell, said it was “an exciting investment” for residents.He said the large centre would have 1500 sq m (16,000 sq ft) of floor space and would be made up of 45 modules built off-site, which would then be transported and connected together in Rackheath.It is expected to serve up to 10,000 patients.Planning permission for the work was granted at the end of last year.
News that construction will begin soon is being welcomed, as the North Rackheath Masterplan will see up to 3,850 homes added to the village.Conservative councillor Mr Whymark said he had “battled” for the medical centre to be built.“We’ve all seen huge developments with no infrastructure,” he said.“The big development, 4,000 houses, hasn’t even started yet. We’re at that tipping point, if we don’t get something soon the surrounding services will be inundated.”
