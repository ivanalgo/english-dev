A signed diversion will be in place during the closures.
The county council's £50m project will be carried out on the county’s roads over the next three years.The work on Elliotts Lane will also include reconstruction and resurfacing of the lane, along with repairs to the tactile crossings, kerbs and ironworks.Crews will also be clearing away vegetation from the footpaths. The work will take place from Yew Tree Gardens to the roundabout on Watery Lane, and the Bilbrook Road junction. 
Mark Deaville, county council cabinet member for strategic highways, said: “Elliotts Lane is a busy road that links Watery Lane and Wolverhampton Road that are heavily trafficked, which takes its toll on Elliotts Lane."I’m sure people will notice a real difference and I would like to thank people in advance for their patience while this vital work takes place.”
