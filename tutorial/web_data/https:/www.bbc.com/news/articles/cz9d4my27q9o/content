A teenager enjoyed a "prom to remember" after his dad responded to a social media post offering a free trip to a "kid who loves lorries". Peter, 16, a self-described truck fan, was bowled over when his surprise ride turned up.He was driven to Redruth School in a bright green DAF XF, by haulage firm owner Daniel Carter, whose social media post received more than 100 responses - including one from Peter's dad.Peter said: "I had no idea I was getting a ride to prom, so I was shocked when I saw a truck drive past my house and park up."
He added: "I was very excited climbing into the cab of the truck as I knew it was going to be a prom to remember."Peter said he "loves trucks", helping his older brother to wash his lorry at the weekends and "attending truck shows". Driver Daniel Carter from Camborne, who runs Going Places haulage, removal and storage, said: "I didn't think it would get as much interest as it did."We got more than 100 comments of people interested but they were all on the same night at the same time so I could only do so much".Mr Carter also took a teenager to prom in a van, he said."I was a kid who always loved vehicles and always wanted to turn up in something so I thought I'd put the offer out there and everybody really went for it."Peter seemed really pleased. It was just about making a kid happy, he was clearly passionate about lorries and he was chuffed which was good." 
Dad Rickie said: "My son is lorry mad and I just happened to be scrolling through (social media) and I came across Daniel's post asking if anybody wanted to go to the prom in his lorry."I messaged him and I was the first one to answer so he said he'd take my son to prom."Needless to say my son was very happy because he didn't know it was happening."He's a very nice chap and it was absolutely brilliant - we followed behind in the car."
