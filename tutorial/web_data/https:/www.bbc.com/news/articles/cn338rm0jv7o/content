The exit to the B1180 on the Pinchbeck roundabout near Spalding is to be closed for improvement work.The closure will begin on Monday 15 July and will last for up to eight weeks.Karen Cassar, assistant director for highways at Lincolnshire County Council, said the closure was needed for "utility works" as well as "additional entry and exit lanes" onto the new roundabout. “This will no doubt cause some disruption, but the closure is essential for ensuring the safety of both our workforce and road users," she added.
A diversion will be in place for motorists via Wardentree Lane, the B1180, the B1356, the A152 and the A16, and vice versa.Ms Cassar said some additional closures would be needed later in the scheme, and the council would confirm the details once it had the final dates.The project is being funded by a portion of the £20m in Levelling Up funding awarded to the council in October 2021. The remaining funding is being used across four other projects, including improvements to Spalding’s A16/B1180 Springfield roundabout, work on the A16 Marsh Lane roundabout, and path and cycleway improvements in Boston and Spalding.June 27: This article has been clarified to reflect it is the exit that will be closed and not the whole roundabout.
