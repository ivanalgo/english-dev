The parents of a little boy continue to fundraise for a local hospice, more than a decade after they lost him to a rare brain tumour.Riley Roberts, from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, was under the care of Children’s Hospice South West (CHSW) when he died at the age of six, and his parents say the facility was "such a comfort".Riley’s parents, family and friends have since raised close to £30,000 for CHSW through fashion catwalks, puppet shows, cake sales, and other events.Now, a family friend is taking on a cycling challenge in memory of Riley, who he describes as "a very special little boy".
Riley’s mum and dad, Tuesday and Alex, recall his diagnosis coming as a “huge, horrible shock”, after what they thought would just be a simple infection.Around Christmas 2011, Mrs Roberts noticed Riley being wobbly on his feet.She said: “I took him to the doctors expecting them to tell me he had an inner ear infection”.“But they sent me straight to Yeovil Hospital where scans and tests revealed just a few weeks later that Riley had a rare brain tumour.“They told me that there was nothing they could do for him, and he would be unlikely to make his sixth birthday,” she said.
The couple were referred to CHSW’s Charlton Farm Hospice, but were apprehensive."He was my son, my baby, and I wanted to care for him myself," said Mrs Roberts.Apprehensions subsided after the family, including their younger daughter Tallulah, first visited the care facility in March 2012.“We stayed for a week, and it was amazing for us as a family," Mrs Roberts remembers.Over the following months the family were supported by Charlton Farm. "Just knowing they were there at the end of the phone was such a comfort,” she added.The support from the hospice continued even after the birth of their youngest daughter Eliza, who unfortunately could never meet her elder brother.“We are still getting that support all these years on and when we return there it almost feels like we are going back home,” added Mrs Roberts.The couple set up Team Riley in memory of their firstborn.She said: “As a family, we feel passionately about raising money for the hospice.“Having its support has been the best thing for us. "The money we raise will help ensure this incredible service continues to be there for other families at a very difficult time in their lives,” she added.
Paul Hardwick, a family friend of the couple hopes to raise £2,000 for the hospice by participating in CHSW’s Ride for Precious Lives.The event will see cyclists ride from Bristol to Cornwall from 12-14 July, visiting three hospice branches on their route.“Seeing the support the charity offered the family I wanted to give something back and do something in Riley’s memory," said Mr Hardwick.“Riley left a lasting impression on all our lives. He was a very special little boy.“He will be in my thoughts during every mile I cycle."CHSW's area fundraiser, Kylie Gallagher, thanked the family, adding: “Tuesday has helped us in all sorts of ways over the years, fundraising and encouraging others to, volunteering her time and speaking about her story to name a few."
