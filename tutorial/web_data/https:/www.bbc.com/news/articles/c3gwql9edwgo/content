A charitable trust has been fined £30,000 after a volunteer was crushed to death whilst carrying out restoration work. Peter Konitzer, 62, was completing work on behalf of Wilts and Berks Canal Trust at Pewsham Locks when a section of wall collapsed onto him.A joint investigation was carried out by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Wiltshire Police, following the incident on 24 August 2016. Mr Konitzer's death was "a tragic and wholly avoidable incident", said a spokesperson from HSE. 
Volunteers routinely assist in general maintenance work at various canal sites. Mr Konitzer had been carrying out excavation work prior to the fatal crush. Temporary propping for the wall was found to be "inadequate", and the investigation ruled that there was "no clear methods" for the safe installation or removal of the props.
Wilts and Berks Canal Trust, of Dauntsey Lock, Chippenham, pleaded guilty to breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. As well as the fine, the Trust was ordered to pay £10,822 in costs at Swindon Magistrates' Court on 24 June. It will also pay more than £6,000 in compensation. James Lucas, an inspector from HSE, said: "The situation which led to Peter’s death would not have arisen had the temporary structural works been properly planned and implemented to ensure a suitable safe system of work prior to the incident.“It is essential that those in control of work of this nature devise safe methods of working and to provide the necessary information, instruction, and training to their workers to ensure their safety.”
