A library's 50th anniversary celebrations are set to get under way after being delayed by the general election.The day of events was originally planned at Wellingborough Library on 4 July, but was postponed for a week.It will host performances from local choirs, craft stalls and information from community groups.Helen Howell, deputy leader at North Northamptonshire Council, said the celebrations marked "50 glorious years of Wellingborough Library".
Activities will run from 10:00 BST, with a special birthday cake being cut at 13:00.The library said it delayed the celebrations to not "distract anyone from the important business of voting".Ms Howell, Conservative, said: "Libraries are very much a hub of the local community and have evolved into much more than their primary purpose, which is to share books and embed the love of reading to all."Former staff, volunteers, friends, customers and supporters have been invited to come together to share their memories of the library.Displays will also highlight the past 50 years of the site.
