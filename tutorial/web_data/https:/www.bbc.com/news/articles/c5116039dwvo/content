McDonald's has not yet submitted a planning application for a restaurant in Cobham, residents have been told.A consultation launched by the fast food giant on its plans for a diner on the site of the former Loch Fyne restaurant ended on 23 May.Elmbridge Borough Council said it had not yet received an application and if it did, it would ask residents for their views.A McDonalds spokesperson said they had no update on the process to make at this stage.
A petition was started after news of the fast food chain's plans emerged, with residents calling for a community hub to be opened on the site instead.Their concerns had included increased traffic, litter and an "obesity crisis in the UK".The restaurant has previously said it would "sensitively restore" the vacant site and would carry out at least three litter picks every day within a 150m (492ft) radius.Elmbridge Borough Council said: "We are aware of the concerns of some residents regarding the proposals."We havenâ€™t received a planning application from McDonald's for that site in Cobham. "If we do, it will come out to local residents for their comments as with any Elmbridge planning application. "At that stage any plans would be advertised on our website and comments invited to the planning team."
