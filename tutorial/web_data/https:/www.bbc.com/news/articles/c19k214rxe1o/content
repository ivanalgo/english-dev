Doctors treating a young woman with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) did all they could to save her life, an inquest heard.Maeve Boothby-O’Neill, 27, died at home in Exeter in October 2021, having lived with ME since she was 13.Dr Ovishek Roy, a consultant gastroenterologist, told the hearing: "I do believe that everyone involved tried very hard to get the basics right, act in her best interest, discuss and get advice when needed and so on."She was admitted to Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital three times in the same year as her death, but was sent home each time.
On the first occasion, in March, she was sent home the same day.She was admitted for the second time in May and discharged a few weeks later, with medics content about her nutritional intake.As she continued to worsen, she was readmitted to the eating disorder ward in July, but later sent home."I do believe everyone tried their absolute best. It is deeply sad, all of this," he said."This was very, very sad and we were trying very hard and that’s why I remained involved, as did the intestinal failure dietician."It wasn’t part of our remit to remain involved, but we did because we knew how difficult it was and to try and to help each other."The inquest heard during her third hospital admission, Ms Boothby-O’Neill was placed on a nasogastric tube for artificial feeding, but due to complications it was removed.Dr Roy said further use of the tube was ruled out because of Ms Boothby-O’Neill’s express wishes, and parenteral feeding through a vein was rejected because it would be unsafe in her case.“It would almost certainly lead to line sepsis and death,” he explained.Ms Boothby-O’Neill’s father, Sean O’Neill, asked Dr Roy: "Do you think the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital did everything it possibly could to save Maeve’s life?”Dr Roy replied: "It is very sad, but I hope you get some reassurance that everything that could have been tried was tried."The inquest, which is due to last two weeks, continues.
