About 12,000 extra passengers travelled with the island's ferry firm in the first three months of 2024 compared to the same period the previous year, the operator has said.The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company confirmed there had also been a 7% increase in freight transportation between January and early April.Extra capacity on the new Manxman vessel was driving increases, the company said.The statistics were released following a Tynwald committee session which heard Enterprise Minister Tim Johnston suggest unsold seats and freight space could be targeted to boost the Manx economy.
Giving evidence to a panel set up to review the ferry firm's service contract, Mr Johnston said schedules were relatively "under-utilised" with an average yield of 40% across a year.In response, a Steam Packet spokesman said the company already offered more summer sailings to Liverpool, transported more freight, and offered more discounts on passenger and freight fares than outlined in the Sea Services Agreement (SSA).The new Liverpool ferry terminal, which will allow for winter crossings once complete, would allow the company to "contribute even more", he said.He said the firm was talking to the Department for Enterprise about the issues raised and took its responsibility to provide a "vital lifeline" ferry service with the capacity to boost tourism seriously.
The government-owned firm said it carried 68,971 passengers between January and March compared to 56,835 the previous year and saw a rise in freight. The company said the rise was "partially helped by Easter falling earlier in the year" but was also driven by greater use of the Heysham route and more capacity on the Manxman, which can carry about 300 more passengers than the Ben-my-Chree.Previously released data also showed the Steam Packet carried more than 623,000 passengers and 196,000 vehicles in 2023, the highest numbers for 16 years.
