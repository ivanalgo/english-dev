The prime minister declined to take sides in an East Anglian footballing rivalry as he congratulated Ipswich Town on promotion to the Premier League.Labour MP for Ipswich Jack Abbott invited Arsenal supporter Sir Keir Starmer to the game between the two teams at Portman Road.Mr Abbott joked the town now boasted a top tier team - "unlike our friends over the border in Norfolk".He made the comments while also asking what help the government planned to provide to "struggling town centres" such as Ipswich. Sir Keir said addressing regional inequality was a priority for Labour.
Mr Abbott was speaking for the first time in the House of Commons after being elected to represent the town. He said: "We have much to be proud of in Ipswich, from a thriving arts and culture scene to beautiful parks and a stunning waterfront."
He continued: "Unlike our friends over the border in Norfolk, we also now have a Premier League football team again; the prime minister is very welcome to join us when Arsenal visit next year. "Despite all those positives, after the last 14 years, our town centre is really struggling and desperately needs help. "Can the prime minister set out to this house the steps that he will take to revive town centres like Ipswichâ€™s?"
Sir Keir, who watched a Norwich City game last season as a guest of ex-Labour minister Ed Balls, responded: "I welcome my honourable friend... and congratulate Ipswich on their promotion. "I think it is on Boxing Day that they will visit Arsenal. "I am going to resist the temptation that he puts in front of me to choose between Ipswich and Norwich but, on town centres, he is right that we need vibrant high streets. "We need to make the change that we were voted in to bring about. "That is why we will replace the business rates system to level the playing field, and we will absolutely address regional inequality through our local growth plans."
