Campaigners have gathered in a Lincolnshire village to protest against plans for a quarry.Breedon is consulting on plans to establish a new sand and gravel quarry near West Deeping, near Market Deeping.More than 100 people took part in the demonstration on Monday amid concerns about the proximity of the site to homes.Breedon says the project – designed to replace a neighbouring quarry – would benefit the local economy, protect jobs and "deliver biodiversity gain".
Glenn Fuller, chairman of West Deeping Parish Council, claimed that 50% of land in the parish had already been mined and the new quarry would increase that figure to 75%.“It’s just not fair to the villagers and their quality of life," he said."We moved down here because we wanted to live in the countryside, and they are turning the countryside into an industrial plant.”The protest coincided with a consultation event at the village hall, but some campaigners claimed they had been denied access, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.Breedon said the event provided an opportunity for people to view and provide feedback on its proposals. However, visitors had been required to register in advance.Ashley Baxter, the leader of South Kesteven District Council, said: “It’s a bit bizarre that you organise a consultation event... and then you deny them access to the exhibition.“Letting in 25 people at a time is mainly about divide and rule so they can manage who has been in and what information is given.”According to Breedon's consultation website, the benefits of the new quarry would include "enhanced habitat restoration" to improve biodiversity, and improved public rights of way.The development would ensure there would be no loss of jobs, including in the supply chain, and it would deliver a "needed supply of sand and gravel to local markets", the website said.Extraction and restoration schemes would be "sensitively designed" and there would be support for local community schemes.The consultation runs until 18 June.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
