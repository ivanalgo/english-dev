A young musician said supporting Take That on their European tour was an "experience of a lifetime".Alfie Castley, from Mawsley, near Kettering, opened for the pop superstars at shows in Germany, Denmark and Hungary in June and July.The 20-year-old has had more than 2.5 million views on YouTube for his song Teenage Mona Lisa.He said: "When you get these kind of opportunities you have to take them and I like to think I did."
Mr Castley was signed to Relentless Records three years ago after he became popular on social media platform TikTok.He has just finished studying for a music degree in London and said the opportunity to support Take That had come about through his management team's connections and being "in the right place at the right time".
The singer performed in Hanover, Germany, then in Copenhagen, Denmark, and returned to Germany to play sets in Berlin, Monchengladbach and Munich, before finishing in Budapest, Hungary."It's just incredible, absolutely an experience of a lifetime. I can't quite believe it's happened," he said.
He said Take That members Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald were "very lovely".Mr Castley said: "They were very warm and welcoming, they always took the time to speak to me and make sure I was OK. "They made it feel like it wasn't as scary or as daunting as it probably should have been."He said his favourite song by the group is Never Forget as it "holds a personal place in my heart because after that song is when Howard gave me a shout out".The singer said he would like to go on his own tour, or support another act "if they'll have me".
