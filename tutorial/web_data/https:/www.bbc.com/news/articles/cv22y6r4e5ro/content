A woman celebrating her 100th birthday was given the chance to live her childhood dream of riding in a police car.Gwen Lewis, who has lived in the same retirement complex for the past 30 years in Stanford-Le-Hope, Essex, wanted to go on patrol because of fond childhood memories of her piano teacher’s husband. He was a police officer and always joked with her about making sure she behaved herself.Ms Lewis said she "thoroughly enjoyed" the trip with Thurrock Community Policing Team.
She went on a patrol of her local area, keeping a keen eye out for anyone up to mischief before heading home for tea and cake with the officers and fellow residents and staff, police said."The journey was lovely. I thoroughly enjoyed it," said Ms Lewis. "Thank you so much all of you. You’ve made it at a lovely day for me. You’re like angels to me!"
PC Javier Rodriguez-Perez, who organised the visit, said it was "amazing" to meet Ms Lewis. "She’s had a fascinating life and reaching 100 years of age is an incredible achievement," he said."When we told her we were there to take her for a drive, she was very surprised and got quite emotional. "She held onto my hand and wiped away a tear. "She really enjoyed the trip out – she was smiling and laughing, and I couldn’t believe how cheeky she was. "When we got back and had photographs by the car, she asked if she was going to be our new pin-up!"
Born in Wales, Ms Lewis spent much of her early life in India, where her father was serving with the Royal Engineers. She married her late husband, Bob, who was stationed in Delhi with the Parachute Regiment of the British Army before being forced to return to the UK after India’s independence. The couple later had a daughter, Maureen.
