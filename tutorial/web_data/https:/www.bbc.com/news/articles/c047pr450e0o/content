The Defence Secretary has said the UK is committed to a shared plan with the US and Australia to create a new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.John Healey said the Aukus defence project was a "fundamental" part of the UK's future security, which would fuel economic growth.He spoke as he toured a military steel supplier in Sheffield with Richard Marles, the Australian defence minister and deputy prime minister.The submarine programme is expected to generate 7,000 additional British jobs.
Mr Healey, fresh from the Nato summit in Washington DC, visited Sheffield Forgemasters, which is owned by the Ministry of Defence, alongside his Australian counterpart.He reaffirmed the UK's commitment to Aukus and emphasised its role in job creation.Mr Healey said: "Working with allies and partners is fundamental to our security and so it is a pleasure to host my Australian counterpart within my first fortnight as defence secretary."The UK and Australia are the closest of friends and our work through Aukus is testament to this."The MP for Rawmarsh and Conisbrough, in South Yorkshire, added: "Sheffield Forgemasters is a shining light of UK industry that helps boost global security and employs skilled staff from the local community."This is just one example of how our hugely important partnership with our Australian and American partners can help drive jobs and growth across Britain."The visit comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer spoke to his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese, with the leaders outlining their commitment to partnership.Mr Marles has also visited HMNB Clyde, in Scotland, to see first-hand how the UK operates its nuclear submarine base. 
The Aukus submarines are aimed at countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. They would be able to operate further and faster than Australia's existing diesel-engine fleet, with the country capable of carrying out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time.Under the deal, sailors from the Royal Australian Navy are due to be sent to US and UK submarine bases to learn how to use the nuclear-powered submarines.From 2027, the US and UK will also base a small number of nuclear submarines in Perth, Western Australia.Canberra is set to buy three US-model Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s, with an option to purchase two more.After that, the plan is to design and build an entirely new nuclear-powered submarine for the UK and Australian navies, which is known as SSN-AUKUS.The craft would be built in Britain and Australia to a British design, using technology from all three countries.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
