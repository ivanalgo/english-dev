A charity has stepped in to keep a "vital" community bus in Somerset running.Age UK Bath & North East Somerset has taken over The Somer Valley Community Bus, which was set up more than 50 years ago.Midsomer Norton & Radstock Community Service Vehicle Trust launched the minibus to help older members of the community continue to be fully involved in activities and social events.Chair of the trust Melvyn Johnson said: “I am immensely proud of what we have achieved. Knowing that Age UK Bath & North East Somerset will continue this legacy fills me with pride."
Simon Allen, CEO of Age UK Bath & North East Somerset, said: "Community transport like this is vital for ensuring that people stay connected and can fully engage in the richness of life."The transition of the service was made possible by a grant from the West of England Combined Authority [Weca], according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. In November, Mr Allen co-authored a letter to the West of England Metro Mayor Dan Norris, along with the CEO’s of the Somerset, Bristol, and South Gloucestershire branches of Age UK, to urge more funding of community transport and supported bus routes.The charity is looking for volunteers to run the minibus and is asking people to contact staff directly.
