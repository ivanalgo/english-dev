Two men have been jailed after being convicted of multiple rape and sexual assault offences against two women who were visiting Leeds for a night out.Ibrahima Krubally, 21, of Gledhow Road, was sentenced to 12 years in prison at Leeds Crown Court on Friday for three counts of rape and one count of sexual assault by penetration.And Ibrahim Kone, 24, of Moor Crescent Chase, was given eight years after being convicted of one count of rape.Detective Constable Samantha Wilson said the pair caused the victims “significant harm”.
“I would like to thank the victims in this case, who have shown such bravery in coming forward and have been commended for their courage in giving evidence against both defendants in court,” Ms Wilson, from the Leeds District CID team who led the investigation, added.During the trial, the court heard the attacks had taken place in the early hours of Saturday 3 July 2021 against two female victims who were on a night out in Leeds as part of a visit to West Yorkshire.Kone spotted them when they were outside a fast food restaurant and started talking to them, before inviting them to a house party.The women went to a house in the Harehills area and met Kone and Krubally.
Both victims were then sexually assaulted.Detective Inspector Richard James, of Leeds District CID, said it had been a “long and complex investigation which started in 2021” due to Krubally having to be extradited from Germany after a warrant was issued for his arrest when he failed to attend a previous court hearing.Mr James said: “Unfortunately, the victims' wait for justice was prolonged by Krubally leaving the country during court proceedings.“I hope this case demonstrates that we will work with our counterparts internationally to ensure that dangerous offenders cannot evade prosecution by fleeing overseas.“I also hope their convictions and the prison sentences they have now been given provide some closure for their victims and reassurance in the wider community.”Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
