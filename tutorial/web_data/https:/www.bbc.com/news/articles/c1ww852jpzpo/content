A Covid vaccination centre has been closed after two snakes were spotted in the building. The snakes, named Cwm and Cou after the centre in Ceredigion they were found in, are believed to be an adder and a grass snake.The adder is said to have left the building and Hywel Dda health board said it was seeking help from experts to remove the one remaining reptile. The larger one, the adder, has been nicknamed Cou, while the grass snake has been called Cwm.
It said they were found on Monday afternoon by staff and joked neither of the animals qualified for a vaccine.A spokesman said: "Cou has made a break for it and is no longer in the building. Cwm is still at large."They said it was hoped the centre would be able to reopen soon."In the meantime, they are encouraging the public to get in touch with any questions regarding the booster, noting that their colleagues will not be able to answer any reptile-related questions."It is believed the creatures were either taking advantage of the marble floors to cool down in the hot weather or had been wintering in the boiler room.
