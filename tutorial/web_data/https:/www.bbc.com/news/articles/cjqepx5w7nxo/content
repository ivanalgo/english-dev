A review of the Isle of Man's regulations on fallen stock is underway, the environment, food and agriculture minister has confirmed.However, Clare Barber MHK said the risks to humans and other animals would have to be "carefully considered" before any changes could be made.It follows a call for permission to bury carcases on private land by the Manx National Farmers' Union after recent price increases for lost stock disposal which it said were "unrealistic" .Ms Barber told the House of Keys any changes posed "a significant risk" by potentially compromising the island's "ability to trade animals products".
The Department of Infrastructure's animal waste section holds an exclusive contract to collect and dispose of dead animals from Manx farms.Increases in the costs for the disposal of fallen stock were implemented at the start of July, with the price for the collection of a bull jumping by 185% to £152.70.The government previously said processing plant price rises were "considered an appropriate measure" as it faced an "average annual net loss of just under £500,000 over the past five years".
Jason Moorhouse MHK asked Ms Barber if there was "any possible solution" to the issue as "real frustration" was being felt in the farming community, with some members continuing to withhold payments to the plant in protest.Ms Barber said current legislation did not allow for stock that had died for reasons other than slaughter to be buried on farms "except under exceptional circumstances".She told members the process posed risks to human and animal health from diseases such as foot and mouth disease and bovine tuberculosis.The minister said a review had begun to ensure the island's regulatory framework on fallen stock was "as resilient as possible" and would also take into account "any other practices and regimes that might exist in other jurisdictions".
