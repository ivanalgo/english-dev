The likely new leader of Sunderland City Council has denied allegations he is "Keir Starmer’s yes man".Labour councillor Michael Mordey seems certain to be elected at a meeting on Monday to replace his colleague Graeme Miller.Mr Mordey was appointed leader of the Labour group by a panel of national party officials.Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC) intervened because, since 2022, the Sunderland council grouping has been subject to a Campaign Review Board over concerns about its performance in local elections.
Mr Mordey was appointed after the NEC asked for applications and held interviews.He insisted the change at the top of the authority would not affect the regeneration of the city.But the council’s opposition Liberal Democrats say Mr Mordey is being effectively imposed on Sunderland by Labour officials because Mr Miller was not seen as close enough to party leader Sir Keir Starmer, or new North East Mayor Kim McGuinness.
The Lib Dem group leader Paul Edgeworth said it was "bad news" for Sunderland, adding: "Labour’s London and Newcastle HQs have clearly imposed a yes man for Keir Starmer and a yes man for Kim McGuinness."Warning of infighting, he said: "He’s a lame duck Labour leader who doesn’t even have the support of his own councillors."They’ll be like rats in a sack fighting for months and months and it’s a huge distraction from delivering for the people of Sunderland."
But Mr Mordey said Liberal Democrat claims were "nonsense", and insists his ability to work closely with Keir Starmer and Kim McGuinness will only be to the advantage of the city.He said: "I can tell you from personal experience I underwent a very robust interview about my vision, and my plans about what I want to do as group leader and council leader."As to any suggestions this is an imposition, it’s just them playing politics and trying to sow division where there isn’t any."I see myself as a partner for Keir Starmer, who will be the next Prime Minister, and with Kim McGuinness to deliver the agenda she won significant support for at the mayoral election."
Former leader Graeme Miller said he was proud of his legacy in the city and intends to continue to serve as a councillor.Mr Miller did initially back North of Tyne Mayor Jamie Driscoll to be Labour’s candidate for North East Mayor, but withdrew that backing when Mr Driscoll left the party having not been shortlisted for the role.
Whoever leads Sunderland will sit in a Combined Authority Cabinet with the new North East Mayor and be expected to work closely with her. Some within the Sunderland Labour group privately believe that might have played a part in the decision to take the choice of leader out of local hands.But the Labour Party insists the intervention is all about supporting the party’s local performance. That will cause some confusion as, even though the party did have a bad set of results in 2021, at this year’s local elections Labour gained six seats in Sunderland and mayoral candidate Kim McGuinness won more than twice as many votes as her nearest rival.
Sunderland councillors will hold an extraordinary meeting on Monday to elect the leadership team, but with no signs of a rebellion in Labour ranks Mr Mordey looks certain to take over at the top of the authority.
