A sweet stall at a market that was told to close due to pick-and-mix being deemed unhealthy has been allowed to keep trading following a council U-turn.Kevin Hilliard, who had occupied his stall at Saxmundham in Suffolk on a Wednesday for 20 years, was issued a termination notice due to a healthy rebrand of the market.During a town council meeting on Monday, Mr Hilliard was told he would be able to trade again for the time being.While the decision has been welcomed, Mr Hilliard's daughter Michaela Kerry said her father was still uncertain about the future.
"In dad's view, he's relieved because he can now carry on doing what he loves, but he's very dubious about the long term," Ms Kerry said. "He's unsure and is taking it day by day."He feels although a decision has been made of such, it hasn't."A committee of the town council previously terminated Mr Hilliard's stall as it looked to promote healthy food options.Ms Kerry started a petition, which received more than 1,000 signatures calling for the council to reconsider. However, the stall was made to close on 28 March.In a U-turn, the council said Mr Hilliard could return for now, but it would "continue to monitor the success of the market and may propose changes in the future to ensure the market continues to benefit the town".During Monday's meeting, Ms Kerry said there were 15 people in attendance to support her dad."He couldn't believe that anyone was there to support him," she said."He's still totally overwhelmed by it all and didn't really think he'd get this much support."
Mr Hilliard will be back at the market this Wednesday."He will carry on going on Wednesdays until he's told he can't," Ms Kerry added. She hoped she would be able to take over the stall when Mr Hilliard retires."There's a lot of American sweet shops popping up in towns now, but they're not your proper pick-and-mix," she continued. "I think it's a tradition that can't die - you pick as much of what you want, and not what someone else wants."
