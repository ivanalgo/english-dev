A council is calling for free school meals to be provided for all primary-age children in a part of Lincolnshire.South Kesteven District Council put forward a motion to write to Lincolnshire County Council about extending the scheme to all primary schools in the district.It would offer "much-needed relief for families struggling with the ongoing cost of living crisis",  said Liberal Democrat Murray Turner, who raised the issue.The county council said all infant state school pupils in Reception to Year 2 received free school meals during term time, regardless of household income, and it was "not aware of any government plans to expand the eligibility criteria or age range” of the scheme.
Mr Turner put forward the motion at the district council's meeting on 18 July and said it could be the first step towards a “more stable, democratic and well-balanced society".“What we can do in this 21st Century to improve things is feed [children] nutritious meals at school in their early years, so they can have a better chance in society, because it is proven that well-fed children attain better educational results,” he said.
He later pointed to a reported £2m underspend by the county council in the last financial year.According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Green Party councillor Rhys Baker seconded the motion, describing it as a “no brainer.”Responding to the motion, the county council's head of education support, Matthew Clayton, explained that central government allocated funding and set eligibility criteria for free school meals.In April, a Labour City of Lincoln councillor requested the council explored implementing free school meals across all primary schools in Lincolnshire and to lower the threshold for free meals availability in secondary schools.The campaign was championed by footballer Marcus Rashford, who called on people to "unite" to protect the most vulnerable children.
