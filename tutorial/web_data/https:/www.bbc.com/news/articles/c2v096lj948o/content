It also highlights the importance of good governance, the training and development of school staff and closer collaboration between schools across the city.Councillor Jacqui Coogan said 92% of the city's schools had an Ofsted rating of good or outstanding as a result of its first education strategy published in 2021.She said: "We believe that all families in Wolverhampton want their children to succeed in education. "We believe they want an education system that values and celebrates standards, and where no child is left behind as they learn and achieve through a broad and balanced curriculum."The new strategy was "committed" to promoting "equal opportunity across all settings" to ensure no child was left behind, said the local authority. Ms Coogan added: "The next three years will no doubt bring further changes to the education system.
