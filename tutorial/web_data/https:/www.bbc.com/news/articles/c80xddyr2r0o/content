A young man has told of his joy at becoming a Lincolnshire Coast Light Railway (LCLR) driver. Matthew Forman-Clark, 20, is believed to be the youngest qualified diesel train driver in the county, bosses said.He hopes one day to drive the Ingoldmells-based heritage railway's steam locomotive - the 1903-built Jurassic.Mr Forman-Clark, who joined LCLR as soon as he could when he turned 18, said: "There’s a real sense of history and heritage on the railway and I enjoy being part of that."
Qualifying just in time for the busy summer season, Mr Forman-Clark said: "It’s something I have always wanted to do. "The railway’s diesels are between 80 and 104 years old, so it is a real privilege to be able to drive them, especially as the carriages are 100 or more years old."Tim Drury, LCLR's training officer, praised Mr Forman-Clark's skills and attitude.He said: “I had no hesitation in passing out Matthew. He shows a careful, thoughtful approach to the role. Safety and safe operation are the most important aspects of driving our vintage trains."Matthew seems completely at home in the driver’s cab and with everything involved in the operation of the train – braking, coupling up, line speed and load, awareness of what’s going on around him and cheerful contact with the passengers and fellow volunteers."
Mr Drury said the company was "looking forward to seeing him progress to driving our steam engine".“His attention to detail when cleaning it and preparing for entry into service impresses everyone," he added.Mr Forman-Clark joined LCLR when he was 18, renovating and maintaining the track and carriages.LCLR was the first heritage line in the world to be built and operated by enthusiasts when it opened at its original site at Humberston, near Cleethorpes, on 27 August 1960.
Richard Shepherd, chairman of the LCLR's Historic Vehicles Trust, whose members volunteer at the railway, said everyone had been "impressed by his diligent approach to his duties".He added: "We're used to seeing him in a boiler suit with a generous smattering of soot from cleaning out Jurassic's boiler tubes and smoke box, so when he is not driving diesels or acting as guard, he will be back in the boiler suit training on Jurassic."Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
