Multi-million pound plans to revamp a Staffordshire leisure centre are set to be given the green light.Staffordshire Moorlands District Council wants to refurbish and extend Brough Park Leisure Centre, in Leek, and pay for it using funds from the authority’s £17m Levelling Up award.A six-lane, 25m swimming pool, new training pool, a 25-person dance studio, a dedicated spin studio, and new changing rooms and extended gym would be built under the plans.The application has been recommended for approval and councillors will meet on Thursday to discuss the plans, although some issues have been raised by members of the public. 
One of the centre’s three squash courts will be replaced with a community wellness suite, which will help elderly and disabled people improve flexibility and recover from surgery more quickly.The loss of a court was an issue for a number of people, with others calling for more spectator seating at the pool.Members of the public also suggested a sauna or steam room should have been included, along with an outdoor gym, a full size 3G football pitch and bike storage. Concerns were also raised over the length of time the centre will be closed while the refurbishment is carried out.The work will also see an enlarged gym space being created with 25 new pieces of equipment, a new soft play facility and a new reception and cafe and parking spaces increased from 107 to 124.The refurbishment scheme will mean two extensions to the centre – a larger one to the south east to house the new pool and a smaller extension to the north west for the expanded gym.
