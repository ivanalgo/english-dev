Doctors in Lincoln have become some of the first in the country to use what is claimed to be the world's smallest artificial heart pump.The Lincolnshire Heart Centre, based at Lincoln County Hospital, used an Impella heart pump during a coronary angioplasty or stent procedure in June.The device temporarily assists the heart to pump blood and oxygen around the body during an operation. Dennis Hauton, 83, who underwent the first treatment, said the development has given him a "new lease of life".
The former coach driver, from North Somercotes, would have been deemed too "high risk" for the procedure had the device not been available.He said: "I used to walk to the village shop every day to get my newspaper, but noticed that it was getting harder and harder to do."Eventually, I had to start driving up, but now I will be able to run to the shop or a least a brisk walk."
The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust said the Impella has been used elsewhere in the UK but the centre in Lincoln is one of the first non-surgical units to start using it.Consultant cardiologist Vinod Venugopal and consultant cardiologist Juan Fernandez worked together to perform the procedure.Dr Venugopal said: "Mr Hautonâ€™s procedure lasted around three hours and the device did take over the function of the heart for a period of time."The device did exactly what we needed it to."The most rewarding part for everyone involved is seeing Mr Hauton sitting up, smiling and chatting with the team."Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
