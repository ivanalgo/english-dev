Two students say six weeks working in healthcare in Africa proved to be an "incredible experience".Charlotte Eastick and Alisha Knox, both 23 and from the University of Sunderland, travelled 7,000 miles (11,265km) to Tanzania.The pair, who are entering their third year as occupational therapy students, were based in the city of Dar es Salaam after raising more than Â£5,000 each towards the cost of their placements.Their stint at Muhimbili National Hospital saw them rotate through departments including physical health, paediatrics and psychiatry.
Ms Eastick said: "I think having the opportunity to travel to another country to learn about a healthcare system that is different from the UK has given me perspective and a massive appreciation for the NHS."I had somewhat of an idea of what to expect when we arrived in Tanzania, but being in a hospital environment really made me realise how different things were going to be."Each department we worked in had clients presenting with different conditions, including nerve injuries, anxiety, depression, delayed milestones, club foot, burns and many more."
The women first heard about the opportunity to travel to Tanzania through the company Work the World, which offers placements.They lived in a shared home alongside student doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and midwives from across the globe.Ms Knox said the pair had made "such a good team".She thanked friends and family as well as the university, the Rotary Club of Sunderland and the Royal College of Occupational Therapists for their support and help with fundraising.Their time in Africa concluded with a safari at Mikumi National Park where they spotted crocodiles and lions.Ms Eastick added: "It was an incredible experience and one that I will never, ever forget."
