Rail operating company Southeastern is providing extra capacity on trains to coastal towns in Kent and East Sussex this summer.The firm said it was making trips to the seaside easier with extra trains throughout the school holidays and direct services between south east London and the north Kent coast.Julian Moosai, Southeastern's head of delivery, said it would provide a boost to tourism in Kent and East Sussex, make it easier for London customers to explore the network, and encourage people to leave their cars at home."We are proud to serve the south-east and its wonderful attractions throughout the year, but with so many beautiful beaches and coastal areas on our doorstep we know the summer is a particularly great time to get out," he said.
The company said a direct service starting on Monday, going from London Cannon Street to Ramsgate, would connect more stations to Whitstable, Herne Bay, Margate and Broadstairs.There will be an extra three services in each direction on Saturdays between London Victoria and Ramsgate.Extra carriages are being added to some trains to the Kent coast and Hastings at weekends.And the company said it was continuing to operate extra late-night services from Margate to support music events at Dreamland over the summer.Deirdre Wells, Visit Kent's chief executive, said: "Encouraging more visitors to choose sustainable transport is a key priority in the Kent Sustainable Tourism Action Plan."We are therefore thrilled that Southeastern is increasing services to the Kent coast."She said visitors would be able to discover "gems" across Kent, from the county's attractions to its beaches.
