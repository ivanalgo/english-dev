Officers, staff and volunteers from Surrey and Sussex police forces are taking part in a 240-mile (386km) cycle to remember fallen colleagues.The group set off from Brighton Pier on Thursday before passing through Sussex, Surrey and Berkshire on their way to the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.In memory of officers who have been killed in the line of duty, they are fundraising for Care of Police Survivors (Cops), which supports the families of those who have died on duty.Assistant Chief Constable Simon Dobinson said there was a "real purpose" to the ride in remembering those who had died.
Each rider on the Police Unity Tour, undertaken by forces across the country, wears a wristband in memory of a colleague.ACC Dobinson said he was riding in memory of PC Tony Haines, who served with the Metropolitan Police and was killed in a collision in 2001 while responding to a call.He said: "When when we lose people, we don't forget about them, and we make sure we remember the families around them."The riders have met their Â£10,000 fundraising target through a JustGiving page, which ACC Dobinson said would help Cops continue to provide a "really critical service" to families.
