A UK train manufacturer has opened a national training academy for apprentices at its site in Derby.Alstom, based in Litchurch Lane, has recruited 120 apprentices and graduates this year. The company said it was "vitally important" to give career opportunities to young people.The academy was officially opened by Derby South MP Dame Margaret Beckett on Tuesday - during National Apprenticeship Week.
Alstom said it aimed to improve the experience of new starters following an investment of Â£250,000 over the past two years.The facility, which will have more than a dozen teaching staff, features a training hall - containing a carriage and cab, classrooms, break-out study areas and a canteen.The company said apprentices would be able to gain practical experience working on carriages before joining a manufacturing team and eventually working at one of its 30 UK sites.Employee India Wilde began her career as an apprentice with Alstom and now works as an engineer at the company."University was not an option for me," she said. "I wanted to develop my current skill set, but also wanted to earn money at the same time and that's why the apprenticeship was definitely the route for me."Mrs Beckett added: "I am delighted to see Alstom continuing to invest in Derby's young people, and in the Litchurch Lane facility, the only factory in Britain with the capability to design, build and test new trains for the UK and for export."
