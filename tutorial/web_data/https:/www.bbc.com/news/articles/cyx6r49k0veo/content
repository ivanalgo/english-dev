A memorial to honour disabled patients of a former hospital has been unveiled. A small section of the Nayland cemetery on the Suffolk and Essex border had been dedicated to former residents of the defunct Jane Walker Hospital.The graves had been marked with small iron crosses but they had become damaged or had disappeared prompting a fundraising campaign.A new headstone memorial was unveiled on Thursday, which Tom Weston, a former nurse at the hospital, described as "moving".
"The unveiling and blessing ceremony was a great success," he said."It was lovely meeting up with former colleagues and reminiscing together."The headstone was made by Hunnaball Funeral Directors and features the names of 24 patients as well as an image of the former hospital. More than Â£3,000 was fundraised to create the memorial before the unveiling and a blessing ceremony.
Mr Weston said the hospital was a "very special place to work at" and "it left a big impression on all that worked there".Many of the patients at the former hospital were left and forgotten by their families, according to Mr Weston. It closed in 1991 which he added was a "sad day for many".He thanked those who had donated to the fundraiser and gave a special mention to Jennie Hunnaball, memorials manager at Hunnaball Funeral Directors, for her help.Mr Weston also noted the "memorable speech" given by John Millbank who was one of the first male members of nursing staff.He added the staff and families involved would "cherish" the day.
