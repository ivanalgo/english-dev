A council says two brick walls could be torn down due to their "overly dominant" presence in a residential street.Thurrock Council said the 1.37m (4.5ft) structures in South Ockendon, Essex, were having a "significant adverse impact" on the area.It refused retrospective planning permission for the wall, which is already in place on either side of a driveway in Cullen Square, a report said.The local authority also said enforcement action against the build would be taken "immediately".
The walls are 2ft (0.6m) high and each include four brick columns, topped with black cap stones, that are up to 4.5ft (1.37m) tall.They replaced a previous wall in front of the two-storey property in January, but a planning application was only lodged following an enforcement investigation by council officers, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said."Given that the wall would be highly visible from the public realm, high quality design is vital," the report said."The solid brick wall that has been built, together with the brick pillars, would appear overly dominant and incongruous in the street scene."The development therefore results in significant harm to the street scene and the character of the area, contrary to policies."
