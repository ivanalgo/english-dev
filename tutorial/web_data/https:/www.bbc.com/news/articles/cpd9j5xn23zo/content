A museum has opened a pop-up emporium as part of efforts to connect with the community.Beamish Open Air Museum launched the store at Prince Bishops Place shopping centre in Durham.Customers can see the venue's collections while in store and have their photograph taken in an Edwardian selfie studio.Samantha Shotton, Beamish’s chief operating officer, said taking the museum into the city centre was a fantastic way to connect with people.
"It’s great to be able to welcome people in to find out more about the museum and our work, see some of our brilliant Beamish products and take part in activities, perhaps even wearing an Edwardian hat or Suffragette sash for a photo opportunity," she said.Ms Shotton added people's support allowed the charity to continue its work, which includes preserving the region's heritage and supporting communities through its health and wellbeing programme.
The pop-up shop opened after receiving funding from Durham County Council.Council leader Amanda Hopgood said it was hoped it would help to strengthen visitor numbers this summer and "create an even more vibrant atmosphere in Durham".Beamish Museum is a 350-acre open air museum which attempts to show people what it was like to live in the Georgian, Edwardian, 1940s and 1950s eras.It recently opened a 1950s cinema, toy shop, electrical and record store.
