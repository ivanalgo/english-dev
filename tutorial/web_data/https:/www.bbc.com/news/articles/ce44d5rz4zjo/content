A community has come together to take on a running challenge for a 10-year-old girl with a terminal illness.Almost 50 people have signed up for the gruelling 48-mile (77km) run for Caitlin Passey, from Over in Cambridgeshire.Caitlin was diagnosed with juvenile Batten disease three years ago, which affects her nervous system, brain and eyesight.Her father said the support from local residents had been "overwhelming".
Following Caitlin's diagnosis, her family have been trying to turn their home into a "safe haven" for her by converting their old living room into a physiotherapy room, and installing a ramp to the entrance.Caitlin's father, Nick, and her brother, Joseph, decided to raise money by taking on a challenge which involves running four miles every four hours for 48 hours, around the neighbouring village of Willingham.Mr Passey, 40, said: "It's actually quite overwhelming to see so many people put themselves forward; it's very heart-warming."
The idea for the challenge came from Kevin Brittain, a friend of Mr Passey's who is trying to raise Â£1m for children's charities by running 40,075km (24,901 miles) - the equivalent of one lap around the world.Mr Brittain knew about the US athlete David Goggins' 4X4X48 challenge, which "takes you to the absolute brink", and the two men set about finding volunteers.
Mr Passey said Caitlin's condition had continued to deteriorate and she experienced her first seizure roughly two months ago, so she was now on medication for epilepsy.Caitlin is a keen footballer and plays for Over Sports Youth FC girls under-10s using a bell ball - a football that has bells inside it.Her family want Caitlin to have as many memories as she can by ticking items off her bucket list.One experience she has completed already was being a mascot for Tottenham Ladies in an FA Cup match in March, where she walked out on to the pitch holding hands with Beth England."We've been to watch Tottenham Ladies a few times since and Beth always spots Caitlin in the crowd, says hello and takes a photo with her, and it makes Caitlin feel special and like she has a close friend who is a footballer," Mr Passey added.
Stuart Elsom is one of Caitlin's football coaches and will also be taking part in the run."The pain of [the run] will be nothing compared to the challenge that Caitlin and her family face daily," he said.The challenge is expected to finish on 23 June and Caitlin will be on hand to give out medals and "cheer" on participants.
