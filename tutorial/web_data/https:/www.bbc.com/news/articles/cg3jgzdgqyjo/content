The Ministry of Defence said it would not confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons at any given location, as per a long-standing UK and Nato policy.A spokesperson added the government department respected the right to protest and would do nothing to prevent members of the public from exercising their right to peaceful protest.A spokesperson for RAF Lakenheath said the base was aware of the planned event."We respect the right of all people to protest, and our hope is that should individuals invoke their right to demonstrate, they do so peacefully and safely," they said.A spokesperson for Suffolk Police added: "Alongside partners, the constabulary has been planning for this event for some time to provide a proportionate, lawful and effective policing response to this planned protest."The constabulary will seek to facilitate peaceful protest, by supporting and protecting those engaging in peaceful protest in respect of their rights of freedom of expression, assembly, and association, whilst balancing the needs and rights of the military base, local communities, businesses, and the wider public."
