A theatre show based on one of John Constable's most famous paintings will be performed at the Bristol gallery where the artwork is being exhibited.The Colchester-based Packing Shed Theatre has created a performance celebrating The Hay Wain.The painting is based on Flatford Mill, in East Bergholt, Suffolk, which was owned by Constable's father.The theatre company's artistic director, Neil Jones, said the cast was "itching" to get on stage.
Shows would be held at Bristol Museum and Art Gallery from 14 to 17 August, Mr Jones added.He said the performance had been devised for the painting's 200th anniversary in 2021.
"One of the biggest thrills for us when staging plays is having a unique opportunity to perform it in a space which gives the story extra meaning and relevance," Mr Jones said."When it comes to The Hay Wain, I don't think it gets much better than being in the same gallery where the painting is literally hanging on the wall."Mr Jones said it would be a "huge adventure" that would help to raise the profile of the show, which has attracted interest from a number of West End producers."It's been a bit like being told we're getting the best Christmas present ever - but back in July," he added. "We've known about it for a while and are just itching to be in that gallery performing this show."
