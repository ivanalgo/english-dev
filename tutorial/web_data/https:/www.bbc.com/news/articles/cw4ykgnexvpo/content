Patients registered at a dental surgery in the south of the Isle of Man that was damaged by fire are being offered appointments at a premises in Douglas.Appointments at Port Erin Dental Practice were scrapped after a blaze on 8 July, which took crews four hours to put out.Manx Care said patients were now able to be seen at The Square Dental Practice, and would be contacted ahead of their appointments.Those unable to make the journey have been told to get in touch with the Port Erin team so that alternative arrangements could be made for their dental care.
Manx Care said that would need to be organised directly with the southern team, as calls made directly to other practices about their dental care could not be dealt with.The health care body said it was working with the provider to "establish other options that may be available in terms of location going forward".
