Parents who were invited to a council meeting to advocate for their children with special needs and disabilities (SEND) said their treatment by the authority was 'dismissive and disrespectful'.They were asked to share their experiences at a full council meeting at West Northamptonshire Council (WNC) on Thursday. However, Joanne Coolen said she was interrupted by the council chair while talking about her son and said: "Having that democratic right taken away by the chair was disgusting."The meeting comes after a report which told the partnership in West Northants that it must address failings and do better for vulnerable children in the county.
Five parents were given the opportunity to speak at the start of the meeting and wearing black t-shirts reading 'We will not be silenced’ they were called forward one by one.Ms Coolen said her son, 7, has been out of education for 10 months and that he was “utterly failed” by the system.Her speech was then cut off by newly appointed chair Jo Gilford with time still remaining on the clock.She told the Local Democracy Reporting Service after the meeting: “I found the attitude towards myself and others speaking reflective of the council’s attitude towards children with SEND. Dismissive and disrespectful."Another parent and speaker, Victoria McConachie, said she felt her child had been “silenced”. Her microphone was cut while reading a letter her daughter, 10, had written to the council about her damaging experience in a mainstream school with ADHD, autism and selective mutism.Adam Brown, Conservative leader of WNC, said decisions on timings ultimately rest with the chair after coming under fire for the parents’ rushed speeches.He added "flexibility" could have been shown to members as they were talking on "such an emotive subject".Children’s services cabinet member, Fiona Baker, said: “I would like to offer my grateful thanks to all those brave women who came this evening and told us of their traumatic story."She added that the council is working hard to make a difference to the families.A spokesperson for West Northants SEND Action Group said: “They [WNC] chose not to give registered speakers their democratic right to speak. "Parents quite understandably want to have a say and if WNC really wants to do better then they need to listen instead of continuing to silence us.”
