Council bosses in Leeds have been urged to drop plans to introduce parking charges at two beauty spots.The city council is proposing to introduce charges at Otley Chevin and Golden Acre Park to help deal with a massive budget shortfall.Adel and Wharfedale councillor Barry Anderson called for the plans to be axed after 80% of consultation respondents opposed the charges.The council's communities director James Rogers said a second stage of the consultation would take place and no decision had been made.
According to the consultation results, of the 4,493 people who completed a survey on proposed charges at Golden Acre, 80% were opposed.Some 84% disagreed with charges being introduced at Otley Chevin Forest Park, after 2,964 took part, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.At a meeting last week, Conservative councillor Mr Anderson said: “The vast majority of people, 80% of people, objected to the proposals."So what’s the point of having a consultation if you are going to ignore what the residents are saying?"
Mr Rogers said: “We are still mid-process on this particular issue. No decision has been made.”But Mr Anderson said it was clear the idea did not have support, and it would be better to "say no now" and look for alternatives.A report to the meeting said charges would help fund resurfacing, signage and ongoing maintenance.The parking charges plan is among wide-ranging measures being considered by the council to raise cash and cut costs.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
