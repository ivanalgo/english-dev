Hundreds of England fans have been sharing images of their cats "roaring" ahead of the Euros final later.It comes after Swiss fans were spotted holding a sign at the quarter final suggesting the England squad were more three kittens than Three Lions. England beat Switzerland 5-3 on penalties during that clash on 6 July and will play Spain in the final later.To show support, Robb Corrigan launched a social media campaign with the hashtag #CatsRoarForEngland, starring his pet cat Rolf. 
Rolf, better known online as Rolf the Warwick University cat, has tens of thousands of followers online. His post has been viewed thousands of times and hundreds of pet owners have got involved in the trend.That even includes the Downing Street cat, Larry, and Gladstone the Treasury mog. Although Mr Corrigan admits: "In truth these are mostly yawns, but they look like roars."
