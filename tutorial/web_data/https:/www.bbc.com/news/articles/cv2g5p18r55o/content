A statue of a popular duck who went missing from a university campus has been given the go-ahead.City of York Council has approved plans for the sculpture of the 28in (70cm) tall mallard/Indian runner known as Long Boi.Long Boi lived in the grounds of the University of York but was sadly presumed dead after he vanished from campus last year.Students crowdfunded £5,347 for the memorial, with the clay mould hand-carved by wildlife sculptor Neil Mason, before being shipped to Greece for bronze casting.
Long Boi became famous for his unusual height, even featuring on BBC Radio 1's Breakfast with Greg James show.A report from the council said the statue would “commemorate a well-loved resident”, adding there were no objections from Heslington Parish Council or the Yorkshire Gardens Trust.The report said: “The location is significant being where the duck resided and was usually found and fed by local residents, staff and students.“The materials being a Yorkstone pedestal and bronze cast statue are high-quality, natural materials which will weather and be of similar muted tones to the natural landscape context.“It is considered that there is no harm to the setting of the listed buildings and the sculpture will preserve and enhance the significance of the Grade II listed park and garden being in an appropriate location, adds to the character and significance of the park and does not impact any key views through and across the designed landscape.”
The sculpture will be located to the west of Derwent College at the University of York’s Campus West and is expected to be unveiled later this year.Sculptor Mr Mason said he had not seen Long Boi in real life so he “relied on Instagram photos and videos people had recorded”.He said: "I used those as reference materials, but I tried to engender the character he seemed to represent to people - he had quite an imperious look to him."When I showed the clay mould to the students they seemed quite pleased with it."Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
