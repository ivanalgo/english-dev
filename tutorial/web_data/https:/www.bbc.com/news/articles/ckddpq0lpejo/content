A new holiday park with more than 100 chalets and caravan pitches will be built on the outskirts of a town.Plans to convert land at Acrum Lodge, West Auckland, to create a new tourist chalet complex were approved by Durham County Council.The project will include 104 holiday chalets, 63 pitches for touring caravans, and a new amenity building with a reception, cafe and shop.Councillors said the holiday park would have a positive impact on the County Durham tourism economy.
Peter Seagrave, who is behind the plans, estimated the new site and its visitors would contribute up to £6m to the local economy each year, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service.He said: "10 years ago, it would have seemed less likely that a larger scale scheme for chalet and touring park of this scale would have come forward in West Auckland, and yet there is little doubt the market now exists."The site is due to be open all year round but will not be available for full-time residents. About 167 jobs are expected to be created.
Seven letters of objection were sent by residents to the Labour-led authority, sharing concerns about the development exacerbating existing traffic congestion.The entrance to the proposed site was highlighted as a potential hazard due to its location on a busy stretch of road.But Labour councillor David Boyes said the road had improved after safety measures were introduced, telling a planning meeting: "The amount of serious accidents and fatalities has dropped in recent years."Visit County Durham backed the plans, saying the site would help address the undersupply of visitor accommodation in the region.Labour councillor Jim Atkinson also spoke in favour of the plans. He said: “The benefits outweigh any harm being considered, and the benefits to the economy look good. "All of these things have the right vibrations for me.”
