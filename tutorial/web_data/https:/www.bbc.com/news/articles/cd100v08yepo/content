Demolition work is set to begin along the Suffolk coastline to make way for a new development. The building works, which will see existing structures on Jubilee Parade in Lowestoft demolished to create a new two-storey restaurant and cafe complex, will start on 8 April. A cafe called Sunrise at Zak's, which is on the parade, has been moved to temporary accommodation while the works are carried out.Paul Wood, the head of economic development and regeneration at East Suffolk Council, described the development as "exciting".
As well as the new restaurant and cafe, five new shops will be created on the ground floor along with new loos, outdoor showers and changing facilities. A lift and staircase between the esplanade, restaurant and lower promenade levels would also be created to improve access to the seafront. The council said the existing structures in the area were "unable to support modern facilities". 
Martin and Emma Williams from Sunrise at Zak's said they were "excited" for the future, when the business moves into a new permanent cafe within the new Jubilee Parade complex. Mr Wood added that the temporary move of the caf√© ensured it could "remain open throughout the build" and the couple could "continue serving their loyal customers". The demolition works, which will be carried out by Lowestoft based PJ Spillings Ltd, were expected to be completed by the summer.The second stage of works, which includes the construction of the main building, will start in mid-June.A new building will also be created for the Volunteer Lifeguard Corps, which has already moved from its current base.The works, which have been financed by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities levelling-up fund, are expected to be completed by spring 2025.
