A ban on bouncy castles has been reversed by Wyre Forest District Council after an insurance issue was resolved. The ban would have seen inflatables prohibited from council owned land in areas such as Kidderminster, Stourport-on-Severn and Bewdley.Prior to the reversal of the ban, Kidderminster entertainment business owner Dave Griffin said his staff would have been affected as one third of his events were held on council owned land. The council had said earlier that the ban would be in place until it finalised a new insurance services provider.
In an updated statement the authority said: "We were in the process of tendering for a new insurance services provider and reviewing our policies and procedures to make sure that events can take place as safely as possible on our land."The authority apologised for the confusion before adding: "We have now worked with our new insurance provider and are pleased to report that we will be allowing bouncy castles on our land."The local authority will now be meeting with all hirers who book with them to make sure they are fully aware of the updated requirements.
Speaking before the ban was reversed, Mr Griffin of Quads 'N' Castles, which has been running since 2014, said his business would "survive".He added: "We have up to 24 staff on some events and it will have an effect on those staff as we won't be able to have all those staff working as normal."Mr Griffin said the ban would have meant events such as Stourport Carnival, Bewdley Carnival and Friends of Brinton Park would be without his inflatables.Follow BBC Hereford & Worcester on Facebook, X and Instagram.
