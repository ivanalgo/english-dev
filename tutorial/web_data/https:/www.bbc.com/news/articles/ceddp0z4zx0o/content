A man with cerebral palsy has abseiled 165ft (50m) from the Forth Bridge in Scotland to raise money for the charity that taught him to ski.Josh McDonagh, 31, from Tiptree, Essex, was born with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy and eight years ago discovered skiing after taking lessons with Disability Snowsport UK (DSUK), a charity based in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.He said: "It was absolutely amazing, the views from the Forth Rail Bridge and knowing I was raising money for such a good cause."It was a bit nerve-wracking, trains were still going over the top so the whole bridge shook a little, but you're clipped in, you can't go anywhere... so I just enjoyed it."
He was cheered on during his challenge by Virginia Anderson, the chief executive of DSUK.She said she first got involved with the charity as her mother was a wheelchair user and her "having access to adaptive exercise changed her life".The charity teaches snow sports to people with disabilities while also providing opportunities for social gatherings.
Ms Anderson explained: "For somebody like Josh, whose cerebral palsy affects his balance and some of his movements, this is a big challenge."What I love about Josh is he is all about breaking down barriers, he wants to see what's possible and is not really concerned by what's not possible."He wants other people who have all sorts of disabilities to be able to push their boundaries and actually have fun, a bit of freedom, get out there, meet other people and surpass people's expectations - I just think he's amazing."
Mr McDonagh said: "I never thought I would be able to learn to ski but the team at Hemel Hempstead have taught me how to ski... They've helped me develop as a skier and I met an amazing group of friends that I never would've met if it wasn't for DSUK."The charity has given me so much and I am glad I could give back in such a tiny way."Since learning how to ski in Hemel Hempstead, Mr McDonagh has taken part in ski trips in the mountains of Norway and Andorra, and has also become a trustee of the charityThe abseiling fundraiser has already surpassed its target to raise Â£1,000, and Mr McDonagh hopes to have encouraged others to reach out to the charity if they have a disability.He promised that he would "find another mad challenge to do" in the near future.
