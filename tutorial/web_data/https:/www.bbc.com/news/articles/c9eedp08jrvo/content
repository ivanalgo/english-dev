Permits are being introduced to ensure rubbish tips in Calderdale are not being used by people from outside the area.The permits will be required in order to use household waste recycling centres in Halifax, Todmorden, Sowerby Bridge, Brighouse and Elland. Each household will be able to apply for a maximum of two permits.The application process has now started, but the scheme will not be fully operational until later this year, according to Calderdale Council.
People are being urged to apply for permits by going to the council website, or visiting their local library or Customer First office.Calderdale Council’s director of public services, Ian Day, said: "The introduction of a permit scheme follows similar measures already in place in neighbouring council areas and ensures that people using Calderdale sites live in Calderdale.“We’re launching the application forms now, before the full introduction of the scheme in autumn this year."The council says rules for van drivers will also be re-introduced, to ensure business waste is not being disposed of illegally. Any Calderdale residents visiting the recycling centres in a vehicle such as a van, twin-axle trailer, or pick-up truck will have to to apply for a free van permit.Residents who have not yet applied for their permit are being advised to continue taking proof of their address when they visit household waste recycling centres.
