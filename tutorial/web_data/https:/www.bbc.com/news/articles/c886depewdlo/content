A hospital chef has marked 50 years of working for the NHS.Laurence Wells started as a trainee cook at St George's Hospital in Lincoln when he was 16 and still works part time at the city's Lincoln County Hospital.He was given gifts, cards and a special celebratory meal prepared by his colleagues.Mr Wells said that food was "an important part of a patient’s recovery".
"I honestly don’t know where the time has gone," he said.“There have been so many changes over the years with equipment and locations, but at the heart of it all is our patients, and that is why we all do what we do.“I am not ready to retire yet. I still love coming to work, being part of a great team and looking after others.”
Members of Mr Wells' family have also worked for the NHS in Lincolnshire over the years. An uncle and an aunt were both nurses.Prof Karen Dunderdale, chief executive at Lincolnshire Community and Hospitals NHS Group, said: “I would like to thank Laurence for all of his service to the NHS and to the millions of patients and colleagues he has supported over the years.
