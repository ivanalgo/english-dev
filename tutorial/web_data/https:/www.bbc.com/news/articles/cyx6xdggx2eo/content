A planning application for a large battery storage facility has been submitted.Statera Energy wants to build a seven hectare battery energy storage system (BESS) at Culham Campus in Oxfordshire.It is hoped the 500 megawatt (MW) facility will make a significant contribution to the UK's energy security.The application will be scrutinised by South Oxfordshire District Council - before a decision in August.
BESS plants are a way to stockpile energy from renewable sources and release it when needed.Statera Energy said the proposed 500MW capacity would be predominantly made up of almost 300 shipping containers.The proposals also include plans to re-establish a 16-hectare park and garden - which will feature new woodland and grassland habitats.Oliver Troup, development lead at Statera Energy, said: “Aside from the national benefit short duration storage provides in a flexible grid system, Statera’s Culham BESS will support the expansion of Culham Campus, already home to 45 businesses and a leading centre for nuclear fusion." "Finding sites that work for this type of scheme is very challenging. It’s even harder to find a site that directly benefits such a unique science and technology park,” he added.If the application is accepted, the new facility could connect into the National Grid in 2027.The company has highlighted sites like it is proposing as "critical" to the UK hitting government net zero targets.
