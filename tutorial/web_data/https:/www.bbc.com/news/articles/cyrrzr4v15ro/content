A wildlife conservation centre in Kent says it is "devastated" after poor weather caused irreparable damage to its roof, leaving it at risk of closure. Eagle Heights Wildlife Foundation in Eynsford, near Dartford, said it would cost around Â£100,000 to replace the structure. It has launched a fundraising appeal and urged visitors and supporters to donate to the cause. The centre said without repairs to its facilities it "cannot continue to exist". 
The foundation, known for its flying displays, is home to multiple species of birds of prey, farm animals, meerkats, African serval cats and other creatures. On its fundraising page the non-profit organisation said: "Our beloved site faces a pressing challenge that threatens to dim the light of our work: a roof that is no longer fit for purpose."Eagle Heights said it had worked with a local company to repair leaks and damage over the years but following an "unseasonable downpour" last week it was confirmed the roof was "now beyond repair". 
The building at the centre of the problems houses the foundation's office, tea room, indoor flying, gift shop and toilets and the current roof is estimated to be around 60 years old. The fundraising post continued: "It [Eagle Heights] is a home to many unwanted animals and a safe place for visitors that find the larger, busier and louder attractions to difficult to attend."We are devastated and panic stricken." It added that it would be organising a number of other public events to raise the funds.
