A community has helped to raise more than £100,000 to save a historic church, but more is needed to stave off closure, its rector says.At the heart of the town since at least the 1500s, Guisborough's St Nicholas Church needs £181,000 for repairs to its tower.Without remedial work, the building could present a risk to the public and would have to close, Reverend Alison Phillipson said."We're incredibly grateful for the fundraising so far, but we want to stay here for the community," she added.
"After investigations following a regular inspection, it became apparent that a lot of work is needed to ensure safety."People might think the Church of England should be paying, but they have thousands and thousands of churches in the country."If they had to pay for all of the repairs needed, they would not have any money."Churches are the responsibility of the communities in which they are set."
Laura Tyerman, who set up a fundraising page, said the church is a landmark in the town and had played a "massive role" in the lives of its residents for generations.She said: "As a lifelong resident of Guisborough, I appreciate the value of our historical buildings in creating our town's identity."It's vital we do everything we can as a community to preserve St Nicholas, whether as a regular member of the congregation or as part of the wider community."
