The Charity Commission has closed its investigation into the medical charity LIVES.It opened a case in April after some staff said they felt bullied and belittled at the charity, which sends emergency responders to medical incidents across Lincolnshire.The commission said it was assured the trustees “had responded to the matters raised appropriately and in line with charity law”.LIVES trustees said: “The charity had always been confident there was ample evidence to counter any concerns raised.”
The Charity Commission, which regulates all charities in England, said it opened a regulatory compliance case in April “following an assessment of concerns raised with us and in the media”.A total of 35 former and current staff and volunteers told the BBC they were concerned about the running of LIVES, with some describing the workplace culture as “toxic”.LIVES trustees denied the allegations.The commission said: “We have engaged extensively with the charity's trustees to establish the facts and to determine whether they have been responding to the matters raised appropriately and in line with charity law."At this time, we have received the necessary assurance that the trustees been handling matters as we would expect and have concluded our case".It added employment disputes are not within its regulatory remit and concluding a case does not prevent it from assessing any new information about a charity.
Commission staff visited LIVES Headquarters in Horncastle in May, to interview trustees and review documents.LIVES trustees said: “The charity had always been confident there was ample evidence to counter any concerns raised.”They added the commission had “concluded no further action was necessary”.“We always said we were happy to present our case to the Charity Commission and we are delighted it has resulted in a positive conclusion.”They said the commission told them the documents and information they shared “provided assurance on their governance of the charity” and the trustees “have strengthened many policies and procedures”.
