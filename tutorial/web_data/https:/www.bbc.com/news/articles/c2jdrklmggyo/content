A Somerset writer has released a book for children based on a James Bond novel.Sue Walker, from Castle Cary, published the child-friendly retelling of the James Bond story The Man with the Golden Gun with The Man with the Golden Tongue on 28 March.The Bond-inspired adventure follows 13-year-old agent Jess Ponder as she navigates the world of espionage as part of the Schools' Secret Agency (SSA).Speaking to BBC Somerset, Ms Walker said: "Reading for children should be something that's enjoyable and fun - there are other people that can deal with more serious issues."The copy editor started thinking about the idea when wanting to combine her love of rhyming and Ian Fleming's James Bond stories.She said: "I thought they could be transferred into something quite exciting for children - what could we do to see what rhymes and then just took it from there."
The novel sees the protagonist Jess Ponder, the school's 'Double A-Star' agent, and friend Leo Sleepwell take on "the arch villains of the world.""They've got these super skills, even though they're not the most popular or even very noticed in school."When they're skiving off lessons they don't want to go to, they're out solving crime", Ms Walker said. Teacher at the school Miss Dench references Judy Dench's role as M, which she played in seven Bond films over 17 years. She said: "The one that creates all the gadgets and gismos is U as in EWE,  just a little play with those sort of Ms and Qs.”
Ms Walker, who grew up on a farm in Jersey, said she started writing stories and rhymes at a very young age.The writer felt able to take her hobby seriously when working for the charity 'Arvon', which run residential courses encouraging people from all backgrounds to write. She said: "I never thought I’d be able to do it as a career as it were, so that’s where it started back in 2013 and I had my first book published in 2015."Ms Walker graduated with an MA in Writing for Young People from Bath Spa University in 2022.The masters has taught her to be less of a "pantser", who "flies by the seat of her pants" in writing, and given her prose structure. Ms Walker told the BBC that there are more tales of Jess' adventures to come.
