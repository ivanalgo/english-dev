A grandmother who climbed on top of a freight train as part of a climate protest has escaped a prison sentence.Karen Wildin, 60, managed to stop the goods train as it travelled to Drax power station in North Yorkshire on 11 November 2021.The wagons were transporting wood pellets which Wildin objected to being burned for fuel.She appeared at Leeds Crown Court on Monday and was told to pay a £3,000 fine.
The private tutor, from Leicester, waved an Extinction Rebellion flag during the protest, which took place during the COP26 climate change conference.Judge Guy Kearl also handed her a two-year discharge, but said she was of "good character" despite showing no remorse.Wildin's actions did not damage the train and she came down from the wagon voluntarily.Judge Kearl told the court: “You walked along in front of the train with an orange flag and as the train approached you started to wave the flag to stop the train.“You talked to the driver and told him it was a non-violent protest before climbing on top of the train carriage for hours.
“You did not cause disruption to the line as the train was only going to Drax."Network Rail had to pay £16,400 in compensation to rail operators for the delays caused, and 16 police officers were required to attend.Judge Kearl added that the mother of four was "obviously community-minded and a loving mother, grandmother and teacher".Mira Hammad, defending Ms Wildin, said: "She was very clear that she was peaceful and she talked in a civil way to the train driver before also removing herself voluntarily."
Wildin has a previous conviction for wilful obstruction of a highway.Drax, which predominantly burns biofuel since converting from coal, said its operations were not affected by Wildin's demonstration. She was affiliated to the Axe Drax campaign group.A month after the incident, an Extinction Rebellion activist stopped another train travelling to the power station, which was empty and scheduled to collect ash.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
