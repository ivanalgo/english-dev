A six-year-old boy has taken part in a charity pony ride to support his friend who had been diagnosed with Lymphoma.Kodie, from Emneth in Norfolk, completed the sponsored 12-mile ride at the weekend for his friend Hunter Martin. He managed the feat despite a break-in at the family yard in which horse-riding equipment was stolen.Kodie’s mother, Stacey Read said: “We are really so proud of him, especially considering the circumstances." 
His friend Hunter was diagnosed with lymphoma in September and is currently undergoing intensive treatment for the next six months. A fundraiser for his family, started by his football club, has almost reached their £30,000 target.Hunter and his twin Casey both play in an under sevens team at Wisbech St Mary football club, where they were described as “joined at the hip and always with a football”. During the fundraiser, the local police patrols gathered to meet Kodie at the halfway point to show their support and all contributed to give the boys gifts.
The six-year-old managed to raise £600 at the fundraiser, and he said it so his friend “would get better”.  Kodie's mum said she was “absolutely devastated” with the break-in but an online campaign for Kodie has been set up to replace his stolen tack. Norfolk Police said investigations into the theft were ongoing.
