A summer bus service linking a Kent town with the East Sussex coast is to begin operating on Saturday.The new service, operated by Stagecoach, will run from Ashford to Camber Sands until the end of August.The number 500 buses will run four times a day and will call at Ham Street and Lydd.The service’s will be timed to connect with high-speed train services to and from Ashford International railway station, Ashford Borough Council said.
Joel Mitchell, managing director of Stagecoach South East, said: “We're aiming this at families who otherwise might not be able to get to the coast, either because they don't have access to a car or potentially because the railway is unaffordable or doesn't get them where they want to go.“It’s about looking after the community and trying to do something a bit different and worthwhile for the summer holidays.”Return tickets will cost £5, with family day tickets costing £17.10.
