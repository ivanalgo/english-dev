A University of Sussex professor has been elected as a fellow of the British Academy.Established in 1902, the British Academy is the UK’s national academy for the humanities and social sciences, consisting of more than 1,700 leading minds in these subjects.Liz James, professor of art history and interim dean of media, arts and humanities, is part of a new group of fellows elected to the academy.“It is an honour to receive this fellowship,” she said.
Ms James’ area of expertise is the Byzantine Empire (c330-1453 CE) and the non-western medieval world, with a particular interest in mosaics.“It is always a joy for Byzantine studies to get some form of recognition,” she said.“I’m grateful for the support of colleagues and especially students over the years who have brought themselves to do modules involving Byzantium and mosaics.”Ms James has worked at the university since 1993.Michael Luck, deputy vice chancellor at the university, said the fellowship was “richly deserved and a true mark of distinction”.“This provides recognition of her longstanding teaching and research contributions, as well as her passion about, and knowledge of, the world of Byzantine art. I’m delighted for her,” he said.
