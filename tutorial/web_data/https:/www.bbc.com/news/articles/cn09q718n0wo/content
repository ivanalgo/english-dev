A man whose water scooter riding forced a ferry to "slam on the brakes" has become the first person to be cautioned under a new water safety law, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has said.Police officers spotted the rider recklessly crossing a ferry's path and getting within "metres of its bow" in Cowes Harbour, Isle of Wight, in August last year.The MCA said the actions of the man, who is in his 20s and from Southampton, resulted in the ferry's master making "significant changes to steerage and power to reduce the risk of a collision".He admitted on 1 July to breaching collision prevention legislation, which was expanded in March 2023 to apply to water scooters and other powered watercraft of any size.
MCA departmental inspector Lesley Hopker said the water scooter rider was "very remorseful"."[He] appreciated that his actions had forced a ferry with many people onboard to, essentially, slam on the brakes," she said."At a busy harbour, on the last day of Cowes Week, this could have had serious consequences. "It's a timely reminder that even small watercraft are now covered by maritime law and action will be taken against those breaking the rules."
