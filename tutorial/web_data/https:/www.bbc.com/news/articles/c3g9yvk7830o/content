MSP Richard Lochhead has told how he had to learn to walk again as he recovered from a life-threatening sepsis infection.The SNP minister underwent emergency surgery at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in May after the infection impacted a valve in his heart.He had originally been treated at Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin after feeling unwell with what he thought was flu.The 54-year-old MSP for Moray said that at one "fragile point" doctors briefed his family that his condition was "very serious".
Now recovering at home, Mr Lochhead told the Press and Journal newspaper: "The NHS saved my life."It reminds you in this country how lucky we are to have the NHS and it was there for me in my hour of need."I'm eternally grateful."Mr Lochhead was initially taken to Dr Gray's Hospital after he was unable to get up from the bathroom floor.Doctors at the hospital diagnosed sepsis, and he was later transferred to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.It was there that emergency surgery was carried out to replace a heart valve which had been badly affected by the infection.
Mr Lochhead said the procedure "didn't go too smoothly", with the operation taking longer than expected.The MSP said: "There's no doubt that I'm lucky to be here."The business minister spent six weeks in hospital and said there were times when he "couldn't do anything"."I had to learn to walk again. I'd lost my voice," he said."It took two to three weeks to get my voice back."With his recovery now progressing, he hopes to be back at Holyrood when MSPs return in September after the summer recess.First minister and long-time colleague John Swinney had previously expressed his thanks for the care given to his "dear friend" when he was "gravely ill".Posting on social media site X when Mr Lochhead returned home last month, Mr Swinney gave his "heartfelt thanks to everyone who has helped save his life".
