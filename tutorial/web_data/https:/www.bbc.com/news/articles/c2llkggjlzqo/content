A number of people from Jersey have been awarded the King Charles III Coronation medal, in recognition of their contribution to Coronation celebrations in May 2023.Several groups - including the living history group the 1781 Jersey Militia - received medals at the ceremony, held in the library of the Old Court on Monday.The Bailiff of Jersey Sir Timothy Le Cocq said about 20,000 civilians received the medal in recognition of their "own special contribution".He said this was in addition to about 400,000 medals given to those serving in the armed forces and emergency services.
Other recipients included individuals who were directly involved in delivering the on-island events, and the Bailiffâ€™s Chambers Crowning Glory schools outreach programme, which saw 8,000 children from all 33 primary schools make a crown to commemorate the Coronation.Speaking at the ceremony, Sir Timothy said: "That means the recipients here this evening are of only 0.029% of the British Isles who are receiving medals outside of a uniformed service. "This alone is exceptional."
