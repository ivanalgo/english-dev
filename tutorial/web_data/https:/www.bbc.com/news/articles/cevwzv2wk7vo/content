A man has appeared in court charged with trying to prevent the lawful burial of his father in Londonderry. John Garret O'Sullivan, 55, appeared via video link at Londonderry Magistrates' Court on Monday charged in relation to the death of Noel O'Sullivan.He told police he had put his father in the refrigerator to preserve the body, as well as his privacy and dignity.The body of Mr O'Sullivan, who was in his 80s, was found at his home on the Culmore Road in Derry last Wednesday. 
His son is accused of attempting to prevent the lawful and decent burial of his father on dates between 1 and 17 July this year.A post-mortem examination was held on Friday to determine the cause of death, but the results were inconclusive.A police officer told the court they could connect the accused to the charge and opposed bail.The detective constable said concerns for the welfare of Noel O'Sullivan had been raised by his daughter.When police arrived at the house, they had to force entry to the property and immediately noticed "the odour of human remains".John O'Sullivan was said to have spoken to staff in a parochial house in Buncrana, County Donegal, as well as undertakers, but the court heard that no arrangements had been made for the burial of his father. The accused said his father had been drinking and he was abusive to him ten days earlier so he went to bed and then found him dead the next day. He said that he did not contact a GP as his father had already died.
The court was told that the accused had a history of mental illness and those concerns had been raised previously by his family. The police objected to bail, saying a suitable address had not been provided and  that Mr O'Sullivan was a flight risk. A defence lawyer said the defendant had no record and the court was told he was well-educated with a PhD in engineering. The Deputy District Judge Philip Mateer said this was "'a distressing case for the family and an unusual case for the court".He refused bail and agreed with a defence solicitor that a psychiatric assessment be carried out.The defendant was remanded in custody to appear again next month.
