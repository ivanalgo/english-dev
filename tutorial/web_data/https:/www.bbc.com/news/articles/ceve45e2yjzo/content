A blind man has labelled a village's newly installed cycle lane as dangerous and discriminatory to the disabled and the partially-sighted.Rochdale resident Kevin Greenan says the design of the newly completed cycle lane, that runs on both sides of Manchester Road, Castleton, poses a risk to his safety.The 69-year-old called on council and transport bosses behind the scheme to walk with him blindfolded so they could understand what it was like.Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) said it had "worked with Rochdale Council to ensure the scheme meets regional and national accessibility guidelines".The new £1.2m cycle lane, which opened last month, is part of an active travel scheme funded by TfGM promoting healthier living and sustainable travel.
“The problem here is that if I want to get a bus, when I’m standing at the bus stop, there is a cycle lane between me and where I would get on to the bus,” Mr Greenan explained. “What I need is for the bus to pull into the kerb, but obviously at the moment that can’t happen.“I’ve got to cross the cycle lane to get to the bus. It’s dangerous, it’s unacceptable to me. It’s already stressful enough for me to travel, and this adds stress."He described the demarcation on the edges of the pavement that meet the cycle lane as “impossible” as he said he would have no clue there was a cycle lane coming up if he was not told previously.Walking back from the train station towards the library, he claims there are subtle trip hazards on the pavement where it has been adapted for the new cycle lane including loose brickwork and no indent to indicate the end of the pavement.But the biggest danger Kevin pointed out during the short walk was at the junction where Manchester Road meets Partington Street and Royle Barn Road. Here the crossing has been adapted to diagonal shape.In response to criticism of the design, a spokesperson for TfGM said: “We have been made aware of the recent concerns raised by the National Federation of the Blind UK about the Castleton Phase1 active travel scheme.“During the scheme development and delivery, TfGM has worked with Rochdale Council to ensure the scheme meets regional and national accessibility guidelines. However, we recognise that once a scheme has been built, there may be issues that come to light through people’s practical experience of using it and we will be discussing some of the issues raised with our colleagues at Rochdale Council.“As we build the integrated Bee Network, we want to make sure that walking, wheeling and cycling infrastructure and the links to public transport are accessible for everyone.”
