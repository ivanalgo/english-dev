A fundraising campaign to rescue five African lions from Ukraine is doing well but a lot more money is needed, according to an animal sanctuary.The Big Cat Sanctuary, based in Smarden, Kent, launched an appeal in May to rehome the animals which are currently in war-torn Kyiv.The lions have been temporarily living in a shelter called Wild Animal Rescue, which rescues animals across Ukraine, while a dedicated enclosure is built in Kent.The sanctuary said it was "delighted" to have raised £183,000 of its target of £500,000 since the campaign was launched in May.
The lions are believed to be suffering PTSD in Ukraine as a result of the ongoing conflict, the sanctuary said. There are four lionesses, named Vanda, Amani, Lira and Yuna, and one male, called Rori, who it intends to relocate to Kent.The sanctuary said it is working with the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) to evacuate the lions "as quickly and safely as possible". 
A spokesperson said: "We hope that one of the habitats will be completed for lioness Yuna in July. "Yuna, who has suffered from severe shell shock, will be the first to arrive, while the other four lions will go to holding facilities in Belgium until their new homes are ready."Lynn Whitnall, chief executive officer at The Big Cat Sanctuary, said: "It’s been an incredible effort from our team who have been working tirelessly to give these lions a home here in Kent. "The next step, once the documents are complete, is that we can go over and rescue  them. "We’re so close. So any help, large or small, would be greatly appreciated."
