Safety work is set to begin at a country park after trees were cut down to create illegal bike trails.More than 50 trees were felled or damaged and a badger sett was destroyed at Newbold Comyn in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, in June.Branches were torn off and markings were etched into the bark as vandals sought to create unauthorised cycle trails through the woodlands.The destruction is currently being investigated by Warwickshire Police’s rural crime team, Warwick District Council said.
The authority said the site had been inspected by the forestry team and work to make the trees safe for visitors would begin next week.Councillor Will Roberts said: “This wanton destruction of woodland, which is home to many habitats and species, is ecological vandalism.“The council strongly condemns any activity like this which can cause serious harm to these habitats and the public.”He said there would be an increased presence in the area to deter "any new unauthorised developments".
