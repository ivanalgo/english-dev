Plans to demolish a vacant care home have been submitted after the building became a target for vandalism. Evelyn Wright House on Badby Road in Daventry, which was built in 1964, was a care home before it closed in 2017. The home, with space for 35 beds, was run and then shut down by the former Northamptonshire County Council due to the expensive repairs needed to bring the site to the required standard. A spokesperson for West Northamptonshire Council said the site will be retained by the council for "future provision". 
Since it's closure seven years ago, the site has remained empty and been subject to about 60 vandalism attacks, leaving it with no heating or power and water damage. While measures have been put in place to make the site secure, it has continued to be targeted. In an application report, it said the site posed a "health and safety risk" to the general public and neighbouring properties if it was subject to an arson attack. Once it has been demolished, it will be made safe with barriers put around the  site until any future developments start.While the plans will need to gain proper approval, documents suggest work could commence in October and be completed by the end of the year.
