A new digital system to help the NHS in Torbay and south Devon know if local people still need their appointments and want to stay on a waiting list has been launched.The hospital trust said it would now text anyone who had been waiting more than 12 weeks for an appointment to ask them to input whether they want to remain or be removed via its new Patient Hub.Once filled out, the trust said data would be automatically updated to ensure waiting lists were up to date - resulting in fewer missed appointments and people being seen quicker.Tony Ray, patient access manager, said he hoped it would "make things easier and quicker for people waiting for care" and reduce the number of letters sent.
He said: "Many of us receive texts from our doctors or dentists reminding us of appointments, this is essentially the same thing so we hope that this new validation process will make things easier for our patients."You wonâ€™t have to do anything prior to us contacting you - we will set up the account for you and you will still be able to speak to the booking team as you have previously if you so wish."The trust said it would support patients waiting for head and neck, surgery, ophthalmology, musculoskeletal and medicine appointments.Mr Ray said the new system would be "gradually" rolled out throughout 2024.
