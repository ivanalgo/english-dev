One of the UK's oldest brass bands is on the hunt for a new conductor.Watchet Town Band formed in 1893 from the local militia and has been making music in Somerset ever since - it is now 131 years old.After leading the band for 34 years, conductor Chris Crockford plans to leave the role in February due to an arm injury."I will miss it, but I'll always be able to go and have a listen," Mr Crockford said.
"We've had a few people say they might be interested in the job."Some have come to meet the band and have a go,"  he said.The conductor keeps musicians in time and holds the "balance of the band", he added. "Everyone has got their own dynamics and parts to play, but it's the conductors job to balance that in the middle because half the band can't hear what the other half is doing."Otherwise it doesn't work at all,"  he said.Mr Crockford started playing the trombone at school at the age of 14.His family then moved to Watchet from Birmingham, which is when he joined the band.
