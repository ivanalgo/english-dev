Historical bronze tablets honouring soldiers who died during World War One have gone on display at Lincoln County Hospital.They date from 1922, when they were mounted on the wall of a new x-ray and pathology department paid for by members of the Lincolnshire Yeomanry in tribute to their fallen comrades.The tablets, which include the names of 143 officers and men, were removed in 2011 and taken into storage during renovation work.Now, with the help of Michael Credland, a military historian, the tablets have been restored and remounted near the main entrance to the hospital.  
â€œWe are very proud to display the bronze tablets once again," said Steve Martin, who chairs the Armed Forces Staff Network at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust. "We hope that patients and staff alike enjoy reading about the history."The Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, Toby Dennis, unveiled the new mounting, along with a plaque that tells the story of the yeomanry and its connection with the hospital.The tablets can be seen between the hospital shop and chapel.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
