Police have asked parents to speak to their children about the dangers of making prank 999 calls.Cambridgeshire Police said hoax calls to emergency services, which are a criminal offence, tend to increase during the six-week school break.At the same time, demand for emergency help increases in the summer because more people are out and about.Supt Neil Billany said holiday "boredom" was often to blame and added: "Our 999 phone lines are often the target of hoax calls from youngsters, messing around with their friends."
He added: "We also ask parents and carers to provide children with ideas on how to spend their time safely and out of trouble, to avoid boredom which can lead to hoax calls."The force said prank calls place a strain on police resources and stop people in genuine need from getting through.
In transcripts released by the police, one person called 999 asking for help with their homework, while another asked for a McDonald's.Another caller said: "My friend's been run over by a car. Oh, never mind sorry."People found to be making a hoax call could face a maximum penalty of up to six months in prison and a fine of Â£5,000.Cambridgeshire Police also urged parents to tell their children what to do if they ring 999 by mistake, which is to call back and tell the operator they are safe.The force said prank calls to the police can be reported on its information pages.
