"I've always been interested in Lego, ever since the children were small," says 85-year-old John Tasker from Tonbridge. Alongside his son Mark, 55, the pair have built a replica of the 14th Century Ightham Mote in Ivy Hatch, Kent, entirely out of Lego bricks. The model took three months to build and used around 8,500 bricks. The duo have offered their creation to the National Trust as a donation to be displayed at the site. 
The National Trust, which cares for Ightham Mote, describes it as a "perfectly preserved medieval moated manor house" built from Kentish ragstone and Wealden oak. "It was a combined idea to build Ightham Mote," John Tasker said. "It isn't too large, the problem is when you pick something too big in order to bring it down to a buildable size you lose detail." Mr Tasker said the National Trust were "looking into accepting it as a donation" as the model was "too big" for him to display at home. 
In a post on social media, Ightham Mote said it was "beyond thrilled" by the creation. "Their attention to detail is truly astonishing. They even managed to capture our Grade 1-listed dog kennel in the courtyard," the team said. It added that it was "impressed and grateful" for the "heartfelt" gesture. 
John Tasker previously build a model of Tonbridge Castle, which he still displays in his home. His son said: "Itâ€™s enjoyable and a good thing to do together, we were more than pleased with the end result."I think dad wants to have a little rest from it but we'll definitely have a go at something else."
