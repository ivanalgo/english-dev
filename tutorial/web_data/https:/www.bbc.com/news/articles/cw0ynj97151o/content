An online scam which offered Highland cows for sale was exposed after potential buyers turned up at a country park.Falkirk Council's Trading Standards said the animals and other livestock at Muiravonside were listed on a bogus website.It used the 170-acre parkâ€™s address and postcode fraudulently in a bid to appear credible with the public.Trading Standards officers found that the website had also been used for scam puppy sales.
Michael McGuiness, head of growth, planning, sport and culture, said: "It is deeply concerning to see scammers using a place like Muiravonside Country Park to deceive unsuspecting buyers."We urge everyone to exercise caution when making purchases online, especially from unfamiliar websites."
Trading Standards officers have alerted Nominet, the company responsible for managing domain names in the UK, so the fraudulent site can be taken down.Claire Martin, countryside ranger at Muiravonside, described the con as "disappointing".She added: "Our cattle are not for sale however we do have five, very lovely Highland coos that the public are more than welcome to visit at the park."Trading Standards urged people to verify any website or online business before making financial transactions involving significant purchases, such as livestock or pets.
