A fire-damaged former cinema and bar could be transformed into a community centre featuring an indoor "winter garden".Giroscope, a social housing charity, has lodged plans to refurbish the West Park Palace on Anlaby Road, Hull.The derelict building, formerly home to a cinema and later Premiere Bar, has been empty since 2007 and went up in flames last year.It is hoped that the winter garden – a large events space – would host live music performances, social gatherings, and sport and exercise classes, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
In addition, there would be a variety of function rooms and "enterprise zones" for small businesses. A roof terrace would have views of West Park.According to a planning document, the development would match Giroscope's strategy of "tackling vacant and underused properties" to create benefits such as "affordable workspace and employment”.In June 2023, a fire caused significant damage to the building but the main facade was saved.Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
