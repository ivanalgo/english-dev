A series of walkouts planned by teachers at a prestigious grammar school has been called off.Members of the National Education Union (NEU) voted to suspend the strikes on 12 and 13 June after reaching an agreement with The Blue Coat School in Liverpool.Staff walked on four days in May after a row over issues such as "unmanageable" workloads, safety concerns and management culture.Bora Oktas, of the NEU, said members had "ensured their voices were heard" after "too many chaotic and challenging months".
School principal Kevin Sexton, who joined on secondment midway through the strikes, and chairman of trustees Sean Fitzsimmons said they were "so pleased" by the suspension.In a joint statement they said it had been a "particularly challenging period", where many "felt like finding a way forward was going to be incredibly challenging".The agreement with the NEU comes after the school had responded to members' concerns, and would provide a base to make "tangible progress".
Teachers at the historical grammar school, founded in 1708, had voted by 93% to back strike action in March in an NEU ballot of 70 staff members.The row, which saw police called to one meeting, broke out over what the union described as the "unsatisfactory" way work was allocated, and concerns over "dilapidated premises and equipment".It was followed by the chairman of the school's board of trustees stepping down with immediate effect.An NEU spokeswoman said members had campaigned for the "departure of senior school figures", and had now signed a resolution agreement. It addresses "deeply and widely felt issues related to accountability, transparency, bullying, harassment, and health and safety concerns", she added.
