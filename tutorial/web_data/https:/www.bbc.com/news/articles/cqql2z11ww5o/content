The health watchdog has criticised a care home that houses 46 people for putting some residents at risk.Banbury Heights Nursing Home, in Oxfordshire, has been told by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) that it requires improvement.A report into the home criticised its assessment and mitigation of risks, as well as governance and management of medicines.The home did not respond to a request from the BBC for comment.
People with dementia, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, mental health needs, learning disabilities or autism are all cared for at the home.In its report, the CQC said: "Although staff stated risks were identified and mitigated, not all staff could tell us what strategies were implemented."For example, when people could not use call bells, staff did not have clear instructions on how often to check the safety of the person."It highlighted particular shortcomings in diabetes care, saying that people were "put at risk of not having their needs met" due to a lack of staff training and documentation."At this inspection we found systems and processes were still not always effective in identifying and mitigating any concerns," it said.However, the report did praise certain aspects of the care offered at the home - with people telling the CQC that staff were "kind" and that they "felt safe". It also praised staffing levels and staff commitment to encouraging residents into making choices and providing consent for actions.
