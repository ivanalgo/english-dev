The installation of a knife amnesty bin is the latest offering from the community group that has also fitted 13-bleed control cabinets across Swindon.Owen's World is made up of the family and friends of 18-year old, Owen Dunn, who was stabbed and killed on 4 December 2022.The amnesty bin, which will be regularly emptied by Wiltshire Police, gives people the opportunity to dispose of knives and blades anonymously, without fear of criminal prosecution.Mr Dunn's mother, Zoe Mitchell, said doing this work is "therapy" and that her son "would be happy" about the work going on in his memory.
The knife amnesty box shows a picture of Mr Dunn at its centre with the words "bin your knife here without fear of prosecution".It is fitted to the rear of John Moulton Hall Community Centre at the heart of the Penhill estate where Mr Dunn grew up and where his family and friends still live.Miss Mitchell said: "We're not trying to catch them [knife carriers] out we just want them to use it and not worry about repercussions."
Ms Mitchell said: "Doing all this is like my therapy."It helps me get through losing him [Owen], if something good can come out of it then I'm happy and he'd be happy."Adding Mr Dunn would be saying "yes Zoe Mitchell!"
Unveiling the amnesty bin was the Mayor of Swindon, councillor Imtiyaz Shaikh, he believed groups, authorities and organisations needed to work together more succinctly.Mayor Shaikh said: "The efforts are going in different directions what we need to do is form a team and combine the energy and effort as one team."Pleased by the installation of the amnesty box he hopes that as a community "we stand by this charity and help them grow to help the young people in Swindon".
Police Community Support Officer, Euan Passmore, is part of the Stratton Central North Neighbourhood Team which includes the Penhill estate.Mr Passmore said giving people the opportunity to surrender weapons without questions being asked has proved "popular" in recent times.He added: "It is really important for us to work with them, [charities and community groups], we've got to work as a team to tackle knife crime."Wiltshire Police reported 64 crimes involving a knife or blade across the whole Force last month, which is 28.1% less than recorded in June 2023.Two teenagers were jailed for Owen's murder in January.
