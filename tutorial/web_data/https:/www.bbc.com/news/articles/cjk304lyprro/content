Walkers and churchgoers have been enjoying the newly opened Athelstan Pilgrim Way (APW) in North Wiltshire.The new pilgrimage route, which was opened on Sunday, will connect 36 churches in the North Wiltshire Deanery with six different circular routes that can be walked.The first two routes, the Malmesbury and Upper Avon circuit and the Gauzebrook circuit west of Malmesbury, were opened on 30 June.The other four circuits will be opened between 2024 and 2025.
The Reverend Steve Wilkinson who is project director of the APW said: “We hope that people will find something in the buildings, whether it’s their appreciation of the architecture, art or history or a sense of God.”The opening is part of many events celebrating 1,100 years since Athelstan became the first King of a united England in 924 AD.The King decided to choose Malmesbury to be his capital and was buried in Malmesbury Abbey after his death in 939 AD.Mr Wilkinson said: “As you explore the countryside around Malmesbury you see the same landscape as King Athelstan would have known. "Many of the churches you visit were places of worship in his time.“We hope that you enjoy the adventure – spiritually and physically!”Many people from the local community have already walked the first part of the way between Malmesbury and Brokenborough Church since the opening.One of those walkers supporting the project is Alison Graham who lives in Brinkworth.She said: “This is about being part of the connectedness between our different churches.“By doing this you’re not only connecting yourself with other people but also with the history of this place.”
For those wanting to do the APW there are Pilgrim Passports where modern-day pilgrims can mark off the churches visited with stamps.There is also a children’s guide for each of the six circular routes.Following on from the opening of the way are various other local events to commemorate the 1,100th anniversary of Athelstan becoming King.These events include the Malmesbury Big Athelstan Dig happening this weekend where people will have the opportunity to take part in a supervised archaeological dig.
The following weekend - 13-14 July - there will be an Anglo-Saxon Food, Drink and Craft Fair in The Cloister Gardens near the abbey.There will also be an Anglo-Saxon battle re-enactment on 20 and 21 July.Over the next three weeks there is an extensive programme of speakers with experts such as Michael Wood and Sarah Foot giving talks about the King.Campbell Ritchie, who is project leader of Athelstan 1100 said: “The town has taken this project to its heart.“On the High Street you’ll see banners for Athelstan 1100, art from the community, window decorations and even the local butchers have Athelstan-themed sausages.“Athelstan is very much still part of Malmesbury and you can’t miss the chance of being able to recognise and celebrate that.”
