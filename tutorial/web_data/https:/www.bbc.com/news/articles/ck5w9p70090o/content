A seaside town is celebrating the completion of a three-and-a-half-year rejuvenation project with a free event featuring historical tours and exhibitions.Celebration Saturday takes place in Lowestoft's London Road South and Waterloo Road, jointly hosted by East Suffolk District Council and Historic England.The event included virtual reality experiences, Victorian stilt walkers, a children's dress up station at the Kirkley Centre, and two hour-long tours with historian Ivan Bunn. The London Road Lowestoft Heritage Action Zone has seen improvements to 25 buildings, including the award-winning restoration of the former Post Office as well as a programme of cultural and community activities. 
Mr Bunn said: ''They have made an excellent job of the old general Post Office, there's no doubt about it. "They've restored it back to its former glory and other properties have also benefitted including the old Tuttles store in Station Square which has had a facelift.''  As well as restoring the commercial properties, public spaces have been improved, combined with a number of events which organisers said had involved more than 30,000 people, including 2,000 schoolchildren.These have included the First Light Festival and a carnival parade led by Sol, Lowestoft's host puppet, and attended by a giant curious fox called Farrah.
Tony Calladine, East of England regional director for Historic England, said: "It’s wonderful to see the restored shop fronts and attractive public areas. I’m looking forward to seeing what's next for Lowestoft."Toby Hammond, the council's Green cabinet member for economic development, said: "We’ve seen the town's rich history brought to life. "It’s great to see what can be achieved by working together with a common goal."
