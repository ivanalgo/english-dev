Plans for a caravan site in a village to be used by up to four Traveller families are set to be approved despite more than 30 objections.The application seeks to convert agricultural land off Lincoln Road in Glinton, near Peterborough, into a residential caravan site. Objectors said the work, which has already started, could lead to an increase in "traffic, air and noise pollution and potential anti-social behaviour”.The plans have been recommended for approval at Peterborough City Council’s planning meeting on Tuesday.
According to the design statement, each plot would have two caravans.The plans include improvements to the existing access from Lincoln Road.Glinton Parish Council has objected to the proposal. In a joint statement, city councillors for Glinton,  Neil Boyce and Peter HiIler – both of Peterborough First group - said: "The character and appearance of the open aspect countryside here would indeed be unacceptably and permanently harmed.”Some other objections received from residents in the area said they were “concerned that the site will lead to an influx of travellers in the area” and also that “the local amenities cannot support the influx in population.”A council officers’ report said: “The application site is located approximately 750m away from Werrington and 1km away from Glinton, therefore it is considered to be a reasonable travelling distance from both settlements and has sufficient local services and community facilities within a reasonable travelling distance.”The report recommended approval and said the benefits of providing for the traveller accommodation outweighed any concerns raised.
