A rail operator has installed sanitary bins in nearly 500 male toilet cubicles for men experiencing incontinence potentially caused by prostate cancer.Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) has put the bins in 495 toilet cubicles at 228 of its stations, offices and depots across its network in Sussex, Kent and beyond.Roughly one in every three men over the age of 65 in the UK face urinary incontinence, according to the Prostate Cancer UK charity.Carl Martin, GTR accessibility lead, said: “This small but significant step aims to enhance the comfort and dignity of both colleagues and customers who may need these facilities.”
GTR installed the bins in support of the Boys Need Bins campaign by Prostate Cancer UK, which aims to ensure all men have access to a sanitary bin.
Nick Ridgman, head of health information and clinical support at the charity, said they launched the campaign to combat the "dire lack" of sanitary bins for men.He said: "There's a paralysing taboo stopping people from speaking up about it."A man living with incontinence should be able to travel away from home without having to worry about whether he'll be able to get rid of his used pads."Mr Ridgman said the campaign has had backing from politicians, business and the public, and he is "excited" Govia are now on board. GTR operates Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Southern and Thameslink trains across 11 counties.
