A dog, who was found "starved and skeletal" in what one charity described as the worst case of neglect it had ever seen, has made an "amazing" recovery.Luna, a grey Staffordshire bull terrier, was discovered tied to railings at a park in Wigan last month by local charity Dogs 4 Rescue.Volunteers said she was in a "shockingly bad state", of the kind "usually only seen on animal cruelty adverts".Three weeks after being rescued by the charity, Ali Hudson, from Dogs 4 Rescue, said Luna has started to recover and is now "completely unrecognisable". 
Those who found Luna tied up at Highfield Park, in the Pemberton area of Wigan, said they could see "every rib".She was taken to Dogs 4 Rescue's centre in Accrington and has "begun to get her energy back". She has been socialising with other dogs, has gained some weight and has been taken in temporarily by a foster family.Her recovery is ongoing, the charity says.
Luna's case is being followed up by the RSPCA, which is investigating her treatment and abandonment. Ms Hudson said the charity has witnessed a "rescue crisis" over the past year, with large numbers of dogs entering its care."We're at capacity, but we are being begged to take dogs everyday", she told BBC Radio Manchester. Ms Hudson said many dogs were being abandoned by owners who had acquired a new pet during the Covid-19 pandemic.
