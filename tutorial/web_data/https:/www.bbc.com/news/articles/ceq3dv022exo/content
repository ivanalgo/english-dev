A tribunal has banned a doctor from working in the UK due to his sexually inappropriate behaviour towards women.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) made the decision to remove Dr Thomas Plimmer - who worked in Swindon - from the Medical Register after several women complained to the General Medical Council (GMC) and Great Western Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.He faced numerous allegations, some of which were upheld by the tribunal, including committing an indecent act in front of a woman and sending her sexual and abusive messages. He blamed his behaviour on an ongoing sex addiction but accepted responsibility for several allegations.
Mr Plimmer was referred to the tribunal following multiple allegations of coercive behaviour and serial, inappropriate acts of sexual misconduct at his GP surgery during work hours, which he denied.However, he admitted to sending a woman, referred to as Miss A, an unsolicited pornographic video of him having sex with another woman. He also admitted to having sex with colleagues during working hours and sending unsolicited intimate pictures - taken at work - to another woman, known as Miss E.
As some other alleged acts took place in private, the tribunal was forced to accept  these reports were “one party’s word against another".Miss A summarised their relationship and interaction by claiming Mr Plimmer goaded and belittled her, saying “unkind and nasty things”.As the relationship progressed, she believed that ‘trauma bonding’ had begun to take place, as she described feeling exploited and coerced."He was someone I’d gone to as a friend in trust, and he kind of used that to his advantage."I felt like a mouse batted about for his amusement, and I felt like that was my purpose for him and all I deserved".The tribunal also noted his impact on another woman - Miss F - who explained in her statement that she contacted the police after Mr Plimmer threatened her with violence if she reported his misconduct."The events that unfolded involving Dr Plimmer, including the threat that was made against me by him, has affected my ability to trust people when dating, as well as my trust in healthcare professionals," said Miss F.
The GMC agreed that his "deplorable conduct" had brought the medical profession into disrepute.In response, Mr Plimmer claimed that his "compulsions" were the outcome of a sex addiction spanning 15 years. He said they were exacerbated by feelings of stress, rejection and loneliness.However, he ultimately accepted his role in some of the allegations, stating: "I profusely apologise to all those who I had sex or sexual activity with, especially if I made them uncomfortable."I also recognise the gross transgression of professional boundaries in each of these incidences".He said he had since sought treatment with Sex Addicts Anonymous.
