A new CCTV system installed in North East Lincolnshire has supported the emergency services more than 600 times in three months, the council has said.The cameras are linked to a control room which captures and records footage which can be used by emergency services as evidence.A North East Lincolnshire Council spokesperson said the cameras were “essential in helping to keep the borough safe”.The cameras have been used by police to deal with issues such as vandalism and assault and to alert police to street fights and drug dealing.
The system cost £2.2m and involved the installation of 130 cameras across the borough in January last year.The council said that in April, CCTV footage was used 200 times to support a major incident which they said was defined as an event attended by the emergency services.The council said footage helped with 206 major incidents in May and 215 in June.Incidents that the cameras have helped the police deal with include stopping a suspected drunk driver, locating a missing person and the seizure of a firearm.Councillor Ron Shepherd said: “It’s great to see how much of an impact our cameras have had.“They are an invaluable resource not only to us but to the emergency services who rely on them for their investigations and incidents."Mr Shepherd also thanked the team of operators who monitor the live pictures from the CCTV.“The team are the unsung heroes of our CCTV network and the work they do is essential in helping to keep the borough safe,” he said.Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
