A former Metropolitan Police officer who launched a "campaign of rape" against his victims, including a child, has had his sentence increased.Cliff Mitchell carried out more than 50 sex attacks against two female victims between 2014 and 2023, including in September, when he tied up a woman with cable ties and put duct tape over her mouth.The 24-year-old was jailed for life with a minimum term of 13 years and 225 days at Croydon Crown Court in May after being found guilty of 10 counts of rape, three counts of raping a child under 13, one count of kidnap and breach of a non-molestation order.Judges at the Court of Appeal have now extended this to a minimum term of 17 years and 225 days.
An appeal by Mitchell to have his sentence reduced - on the grounds of his previous good character not being taken into account in his original sentence - was dismissed.The appeal for the sentence increase was made following a referral by the solicitor general.Paul Jarvis, representing the solicitor general in court, said the previous sentence was "unduly lenient" because it did not "take into account the seriousness of Mitchell's offending".The sentence was "significantly lower", considering Mitchell's "campaign of rape", Mr Jarvis added.
Mr Jarvis said Mitchell had wanted to "control and dominate" his victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons.The court was told Mitchell's offending came to an end in September last year after his older victim managed to leave a car she was being kidnapped in. She then ran down a busy road, her hands still bound with cable ties, before a member of the public helped her.Increasing the sentence, Lord Justice William Davis, sitting alongside Mrs Justice Thornton and Judge Michael Chambers KC, said Mitchell's younger victim was "broken" due to the attacks.
In a victim impact statement, she said: "It sits with me every day. There are days when I cry randomly about it."Following the hearing, Solicitor General Sarah Sackman MP said: “Cliff Mitchell’s crimes were monstrous and deeply disturbing. He intimidated his victims into silence, abusing them repeatedly over a number of years.“The Court of Appeal rightfully increased Mitchell’s sentence, which should send a stark message that rape and sexual abuse will always be considered the most serious of crimes, and we will use the full force of the law to punish those who inflict it onto others.“My thoughts and deepest sympathies remain with his victims.”
