Former North Korean diplomat Tae Yong-ho has been named the new leader of South Korea's presidential advisory council on unification.This makes him the highest-ranking defector among the thousands who have resettled in the South - and the first to be given a vice-ministerial job. Tae, 62, was Pyongyang's deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom before he fled to South Korea in 2016.Pyongyang has denounced him as "human scum" and accused him of embezzling state funds and other crimes. 
Mr Tae became the first former North Korean to win a seat in South Korea's 2020 National Assembly.He failed to secure a second term in parliamentary elections in April, but in his new role, he will be be advising South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's office on peaceful Korean unification."He is the right person to help establish a peaceful unification policy based on liberal democracy and garner support from home and abroad," the presidential office said on Thursday.Born in Pyongyang in 1962, Mr Tae entered the foreign service at the age of 27 and spent almost 30 years working under three generations of the ruling Kim dynasty.He said in earlier statements that he left North Korea because he did not want his children to have "miserable lives". He also cited disgust with Kim Jong Un's regime and expressed admiration for South Korea's democracy.In a memoir published this year, Mr Tae wrote about the excesses of the North Korean elite and the depths of the personality cult built around the Kims. Since his defection, he has advocated for the use of "soft power" to weaken the Kim regime and called for prisoner swaps between the North and the South.Tensions between the Koreas have risen over the past few months, with Seoul resuming propaganda broadcasts towards the North on Friday, in response to Pyongyang floating thousands of trash-carrying balloons into the South. Reports based on satellite imagery also suggest that North Korea may be strengthening its military presence and building walls along its border with the South.As of December last year, some 34,000 individuals have defected from the North to the South, according to estimates from Seoul's Unification Ministry. Many do so by crossing into China and then to South Korea. In South Korea, they automatically receive citizenship and are given some resettlement money.Earlier this week, Seoul's spy agency cofirmed another high-profile defection of a former diplomat most recently stationed in Cuba.Local reports identified the man as 52-year-old Ri Il Kyu and quoted him as saying that he fled because of "disillusionment with the North Korean regime and a bleak future". "Every North Korean thinks at least once about living in South Korea," the Chosun Ilbo newspaper quoted him as saying.Last Sunday, South Korea marked its very first North Korean Defectors' Day, during which Mr Yoon Suk Yeol promised better financial support for defectors and tax incentives for companies that hire them.
