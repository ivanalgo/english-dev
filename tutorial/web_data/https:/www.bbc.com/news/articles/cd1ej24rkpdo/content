Plans to build 58 houses, 48 apartments and new areas of public space in Willenhall have been granted outline planning permission.Derelict structures could be demolished on Moat Street, Temple Bar, Cemetery Road, Villiers Street and New Hall Street to make way for the new homes.Walsall Council secured £20m of Levelling Up funding in January last year to deliver the homes under the Willenhall Masterplan. Arcadis, agent for the developer, said: “Many of the existing buildings are an eyesore and have been neglected for a considerable time."
Further details including the appearance of the buildings would be considered at a later date, the council said.The development has been put into five categories.The former Colonial Works between Moat Street, Gower Street and Stafford Street could be transformed into 22 houses, 12 two-bedroom houses, six three-bedroom and four four-bedroom houses. An area by a former railway line near Moat Street could see 35 apartments, 14 houses and an office.A car park near New Hall Street could be developed as an open space in association with Willenhall Cemetery. An area north of New Hall Street could have eight three-bedroom houses, six one-bedroom apartments and six two-bedroom apartments.Five two-bedroom properties, five three-bedroom properties, five four-bedroom properties and one one-bedroom apartment could be built in the final category, with the junction at Villiers Street and Cemetery Road also being improved.“The current application is for a comprehensive, residential-led renewal of the area that will help meet local housing needs and significantly improve the amenity of the area," Arcadis said."New residents, close to the town centre, will support local shops and services and benefit from public investment in the reopening of the rail station in the town."
