A teenager says a film about knife crime will make young people think before using a weapon.Kardi, 14, is one of about 80 children aged 13 to 16, from four schools in Bristol, working to create and develop a 12-minute film, dubbed Project Fearless, about the issue.Once finished, the film, produced with the city's youth-led charity Integrate UK, will be used as an educational resource and will be shown in schools across the UK.The movie will focus on a young man and the fears and pressures which lead him to pick up a knife.
Kardi, who said some of his friends had been involved and died due to knife crime, said: "We've all had experience of it, one way or another with a friend or a family member."He said: "Most of the time it's disagreements with different people who think it's okay to draw out a knife every time they have an argument."The project, which is scripted and acted by the students, comes following a series of stabbings in the city, with local organisations signed an open letter calling for action on the problem."This film will help young people because it will make them think, and inspire them to speak about how they're feeling and get more support," Kardi said.
Project worker at Integrate UK, Priya Kaur, said: "A lot of young people feel like it's important to address what's going on and hopefully try deter others from making those same choices."Ms Kaur said once the film was finished, the charity would then deliver workshops in schools across the UK to help young people "reflect" and "make different choices"."We want young people to know there is somewhere they can get help and support, and if you find yourself in these positions where people are glorifying certain things to you, to maybe rethink what's going on. "There is support and there are ways to get out of it, it doesn't mean your life is over if you make a mistake."Ms Kaur said knife crime had a "ripple effect" on young people: "Although they may not have a best friend stabbed or injured, they may know someone who might. "They're fearful to go out, they don't know if they might be a target or not", she added.
Arjan, 13, who plays the main character in the film, said: "We're trying to say, 'stop knife crime.'"He said: "Children shouldn't be carrying around dangerous weapons, even if it is for protection.""If you see someone you know carrying a knife it can make you feel a bit anxious," he added.Meanwhile, Kardi said he thinks giving young people "more spaces to talk about how they've been affected" would help deter them from knife violence."Not just tell them it's wrong and say 'you can't do this, you can't do that'," he added.
