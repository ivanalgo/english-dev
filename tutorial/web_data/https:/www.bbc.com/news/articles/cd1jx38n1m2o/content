A council is exploring the possibility of relocating a "tucked away" market to a more visible location.Bourne Market is currently held every Thursday, hosting around 20 traders, both casual and regular. There is also a smaller market on Saturdays.Following feedback from customers and traders, South Kesteven District Council (SKDC) confirmed it was reviewing the market’s location in the Corn Exchange Car Park.Councillor Paul Stoke, cabinet member for leisure and culture, said: "Our markets manager is reviewing the use of the current space and any alternative options that might be available or that might make visibility better. It is indeed early days in this process.”
Ward councillor Rhys Baker said he felt the market could perform much better.He said: "The biggest thing that concerns me is the number of people that don’t use the market at all.“Because it’s tucked away, you don’t tend to pass through that area. As things stand, you don’t tend to go to Bourne Market unless you want to go to Bourne Market.”Mr Baker suggested the market could be moved to land opposite The Old Town Hall in North Street.Another possible location was outside the post office in West Street, he added.Mr Baker acknowledged those locations would necessitate road closures.
