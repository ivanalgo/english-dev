The home secretary has condemned violent disorder that broke out on the streets of Leeds, describing it as "audacious criminality".Five people have been arrested after trouble flared in the Harehills area on Thursday when officers responded to a child protection issue.Videos on social media showed crowds of people in the streets and a bus was later set on fire and a police car flipped over.Speaking at the city’s Elland Road police station Yvette Cooper said those responsible should feel the "full force of the law".
Ms Cooper said: "I've been talking to West Yorkshire Police officers and also to local community leaders about the action they are taking in response to these unacceptable scenes of disorder and criminality that we saw last night."Many people will have seen on social media some of the really shocking scenes of audacious criminality and that’s why it’s really important that those individuals face the full force of the law and that’s one of the issues police have been talking to me about this evening."Asked about footage circulating online which appeared to show police officers dragging a child out of a house and the anger in the community, Ms Cooper said: "Well, I think what we saw last night was the scenes of criminality with the bus being set alight, with the attack on the police cars. "And we've also seen some issues around misinformation about the police having to respond to a complex child protection incident."
West Yorkshire Police said officers had been called to the area at about 17:00 BST on Thursday after social workers reported being met with hostility when dealing with a child protection matter.At the scene officers then came under attack themselves as they helped social care staff to safety.The force said "pockets of disorder" had broken out in the aftermath, with footage shared online showing a police vehicle being attacked and later rolled on to its side.As the troubled escalated large crowds gathered in nearby Harehills Road and several fires were set.Assistant Chief Constable Pat Twiggs said officers were working at “significant pace” to identify and apprehend those responsible.He said there would be an increased police presence in the area over the coming days and urged people with information to come forward.“I would urge anyone who has information about those involved in the disorder to contact our officers,” he said.“Equally, to those who are responsible for the criminality seen in Harehills, our investigation will be relentless and I urge you to do the right thing and hand yourself in to the police while you have the opportunity to do so.“I also issue the same message to the parents of those young people involved, to make contact with the police now.”
Meanwhile, Leeds City Council has promised to carry out an “urgent review” of the incident which is said to have sparked Thursday’s disorder.In a joint statement issued on behalf of the authority and the Romanian and Roma Community it said: “The council has agreed to undertake an urgent review of the case and work with Romanian and Roma-led organisations, the churches, and the Honorary Consulate of Romania and other family representatives for the best interests of the family and wider Roma community.”They went on to  appeal to “all communities to remain calm” to avoid a repeat of Thursday’s “distressing scenes”.The statement said: “Local people are devastated by what happened, and we want to ensure there is no repeat of the distressing scenes we saw."Such actions will have a long lasting and harmful impact on our community.”Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
