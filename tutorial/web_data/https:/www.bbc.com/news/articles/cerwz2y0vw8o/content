Two Surrey women in their 80s have questioned whether they were unable to renew their car insurance due to their age.Barbara Walker, 80, and Lynn Scotcher, 83, both drive Honda Jazz cars.The insurer, LV=, said it "had to make the difficult decision" to stop insuring two particular models due to an increase in claims.Ms Walker, from Brockham, told BBC Radio Surrey: “I still felt the underlining cause for this was my age."
LV= informed Ms Walker it would not be renewing her insurance after she had been with the insurer for three years. She said: "The main reason they gave was because the Honda Jazz was a very popular car to be stolen.But she said she "wouldn't of thought anybody" would want to steal her 17-year-old car. Ms Scotcher, from Betchworth, was also given this reason after being refused. She said: "I also had a suspicion that my age had triggered it. My car is 16 years old, so it's worth virtually nothing."
In a statement, LV= said: “We never want to leave our customers in the difficult situation of having to find alternative cover."There are two particular models of Honda Jazz that we had to change our underwriting approach to because of catalytic converter theft."We appreciate this vehicle may not seem high risk but claims for the Honda Jazz SE models have increased significantly."Due to this sharp increase, we have had to make the difficult decision to stop insuring them."In response, Ms Walker who has since changed insurers, said: “Maybe that’s the case but my particular car is off the road. I have a garage and I've never claimed at all."Allianz told BBC Radio Surrey: "It’s the car - that is the reason we’ve declined. "If they were to renew with a different car that would be fine."
