A year-long project to strengthen a historic double-decker road and railway bridge has been completed.Network Rail has invested £5.2m to overhaul the underside of the Victorian-built High Level Bridge, which connects Gateshead and Newcastle.Designed by railway pioneer Robert Stephenson, it was part of plans to create a continuous line from London to Edinburgh and was completed in 1849. It has reopened for pedestrians and road users after essential repainting and strengthening work.
The 175-year-old bridge needs regular maintenance, and this latest overhaul has included repainting the structural beams holding up the decks with more than 3,300 litres (726 gallons) of paint, resurfacing the carriageway and repairing the ironwork. Much of the work happened at night to minimise disruption to road users.
Sean Ellerby, Network Rail project manager, said: "It's been a huge job to secure the future of this link for rail and road between Gateshead and Newcastle"."I’d like to thank residents’ patience as we’ve worked around the clock to keep High Level Bridge fit for the future and safe for trains, traffic and pedestrians."During the project, Network Rail worked with Gateshead Council, which is responsible for maintaining the pedestrian walkways and carriageway, and organising the road closures needed. John McElroy, cabinet member for environment at Gateshead Council, said the bridge was an "important part of the local travel network"."Its historical significance to the region makes it even more important that we continue to look after the bridge and ensure it remains fit for purpose for generations to come," he added.
