People can now apply to build on land previously earmarked for the scrapped HS2 route between Birmingham and Crewe, the transport secretary has announced.Rules that forced councils to consult on any planning applications along the route with the firm building the line had been lifted, Mark Harper added.The move would bring "certainty" to neighbouring residents, he said.The second part of the HS2 line, the northern leg, was axed by the government in October.
Safeguarding restrictions - planning tools used to protect land from conflicting development - had been in place across a swathe of the country.While they were now lifted from most of the abandoned line's path, Mr Harper said he would still safeguard land around the planned Handsacre Junction, near Lichfield, Staffordshire.HS2 trains for Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland will join the West Coast Main Line in Handsacre.
In his written statement to Parliament, Mr Harper said more details would be released "soon" on what would happen to properties bought for the scheme that were no longer needed.People living in two villages in Staffordshire told the BBC this week dozens of homes needlessly acquired to allow HS2 remained empty.They claimed the properties had been plagued by squatters and cannabis factories. HS2 Ltd said the empty homes were a matter for the government.Mr Harper said he was also closing three compensation schemes for homeowners affected by HS2.The "Need to Sell" programme would remain open to support residents "until the blighting effect of HS2 has fully receded", he added.Mr Harper also confirmed work was under way on lifting safeguarding for land earmarked for the scheme between Crewe and Manchester, which was expected to happen by the summer.
Meanwhile, two Conservative Staffordshire MPs called for the money saved from scrapping the second phase of HS2 to be urgently put towards transport projects in the county.When the prime minister axed the northern leg, he said Â£36bn would be spent on alternative rail, road and bus schemes instead, with Staffordshire among areas to benefit.Stoke-on-Trent South MP Jack Brereton and South Staffordshire's  Sir Gavin Williamson told the House of Commons such projects needed prioritising.A new railway station in Meir, Stoke-on-Trent, was mentioned among the pledges and Mr Brereton said he wanted "shovels in the ground as soon as possible".Sir Gavin said he wanted better local connections to the north west by extending services from Manchester down to Stafford.Rail minister Huw Merriman said the government was pushing ahead with a number of schemes, including those announced in October.
