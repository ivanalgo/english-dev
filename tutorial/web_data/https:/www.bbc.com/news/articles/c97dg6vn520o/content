A former school which had been empty for 20 years has been converted into homes for vulnerable adults.Washington Old School has been restored and turned into 15 specialist apartments by Sunderland City Council. One of the first residents to move in to the building was Robert Richardson, who lives with autism and schizophrenia.He said his flat provided him with independence while allowing him to live near his family.
His mother Barbara Richardson, attended the school when it was known as Biddick School. She said she was "over the moon" when her son secured a place in the building."As soon as he moved in, he loved it," she said. "He's gone from strength to strength - he has more confidence, he's made new friends, and he's very happy."
Sunderland City Council said staff at Old School House assisted residents with day-to-day tasks, such as housework.Graham King, the council's director of adult services, said: "These homes have been specially designed to meet the needs of vulnerable adults, with support on hand to help all residents lead independent lives. "It's brilliant to see occupants moved into their homes and enjoying the community feel of these bungalows while having access to everything they need."Old School House also features a landscaped courtyard containing furniture designed by a local artist.The development was built by Brims Construction and received Â£600,000 of funding support from Homes England.
