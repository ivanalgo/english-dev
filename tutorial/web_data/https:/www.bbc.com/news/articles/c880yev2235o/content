A shop that was the scene of an alleged racist attack has been temporarily closed by police after community protests.The International Superstore on Erdington High Street had been the cause of "significant distress" for many members of the community, police said.Six men, aged 22 to 45, were arrested after a man, woman and a teenage boy were allegedly attacked following a parking dispute outside the shop in May.More than 100 people took part in protests calling for its closure.Campaigner Bishop Dr Desmond Jaddoo said the one-month closure is the start of sending a  message that "racial discrimination against members of the black community" will not be tolerated.
He added: "It is time that racial violence against black people is addressed and not just smoothed over."There have been weeks of action, conversations and demonstrations regarding this and we welcome the actions taken by West Midlands Police."The closure order was granted by Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Thursday.Police said it hoped the temporary closure would "significantly improve the tensions and reassure the community who have been negatively impacted by the disorder originating from this property".The men who were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and racially aggravated assault were released on bail and investigations continue.
