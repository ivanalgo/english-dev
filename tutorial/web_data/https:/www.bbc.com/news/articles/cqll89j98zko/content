The hum of the factory run by Nimisha Raja in Sittingbourne, Kent, is continuously in the background as the business owner surveys her staff and machinery.She said it has been "really, really difficult" for all businesses in recent times.With Brexit, the coronavirus pandemic, and rising inflation in the last five years, it has been particularly challenging for a business owner.The 2024 general election means companies are looking at what the political landscape means for their future.
Ms Raja is the founder of Nim's Cocktail Garnishes, which makes air dried fruit and vegetable products such as snacks and garnishes.She admits the company has had to increase prices "a little bit" but are still not making all their money back from rising energy prices and costs.She said: "If we don’t have money to invest in the business we can’t grow."Ms Raja said she has had to reduce exports due to Brexit, but continues to import fruits that are not grown in the UK.She now uses a third party importer because, as a small business, they "don’t have the time or the resources to be dealing with all the documentation, customs clearance".The entrepreneur believes things are beginning to stabilise and does not want "another upheaval once again with a new government", and hopes that whoever forms a new government "is feeling as tired with all the problems and says 'no, let’s just take it easy'".
The Europa Worldwide Group’s warehouse in Dartford, Kent, sees 100 truckloads of freight pass through each dayIt receives imported goods from Europe, which are put on to trailers for distribution around the UK.Chief executive Andrew Baxter said they made a success of Brexit by "doing a huge amount of work" on how to optimise the flow of goods, believing it created a "great opportunity" and meant they "won huge amounts of business by solving those complexities".The last year has been more difficult, as after a small period of economic boom following Covid-19 things slowed down with less movement of goods.Mr Baxter wants lower business taxes, more flexible employment legislation and more flexible legislation in general.
Nick Broom’s company, PVL UK, makes reflective markings for vehicles - from emergency to highways and commercial - and trades with 27 countries from their factory in Burgess Hill, West Sussex.Due to the company's specialist nature, materials are imported from Europe, America and the Far East.Mr Broom said he holds a lot more stock than before and has to "balance the delays in getting goods out to countries that wasn’t there before Brexit".The company is setting up a base in Europe to supply their overseas customers more effectively.He said he would like to see "genuine long term strategy for export" from an incoming government, as well as for training and development for workers.A Liberal Democrat Spokesperson said: "The Liberal Democrats have a clear plan to boost our economy and our manufacturing sector.“We will finally deliver fundamental reform of the broken business rates system, with manufacturing being among the biggest beneficiaries; bring down energy prices by investing in cheap, clean, renewable power; and fix the problematic apprenticeship levy to make sure local businesses are able to access the skills they need."We have also set out a plan to fix the UK’s broken relationship with Europe and cut down Conservative trade barriers and red tape holding back British businesses.”The Conservative, Labour, Green and Reform UK parties have been contacted for comment.In their manifesto, Labour said it would re-establish the Industrial Strategy Council and also ensure the information small and medium-sized enterprises need about trade is readily available from a single point of contact.The Green manifesto said it would join the customs union as a first step towards full EU membership and invest £12.4bn in skills and training, equipping workers to play a full role in the green economy.Reform UK has promised to slash red tape and reduce the main corporation tax rate.
