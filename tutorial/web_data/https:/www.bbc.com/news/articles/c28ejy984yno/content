A councillor said he was "deeply disappointed" that plans for a giant solar farm in Lincolnshire have been approved.The Gate Burton site south of Gainsborough will cover more than 1,690 acres (684 hectares).The new energy security secretary, Ed Miliband, said solar power was "crucial to achieving net zero".Conservative county councillor Colin Davie said the development had attracted  considerable local opposition.
“I have repeatedly said that these enormous infrastructure projects should not be dumped in our county, and ruin the quality of life of our residents," Mr Davie said."Our agricultural land should be protected and it plays a key role in our nation’s food security. "But these pleas are not being heard by the Labour government now in charge of environmental policy.”Due to the size of the project the site is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP)NSIPs are supervised by the government's Planning Inspectorate, rather than local council planning departments
The Gate Burton solar farm was one of three projects approved on Friday.In the letter announcing the the approval, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said it "concluded that the public benefits associated with the proposed development outweigh the harm identified".According to developer Low Carbon Ltd, the site would create 500mw of electricity, enough to power 160,000 homes.The site would also incorporate batteries to store energy before releasing it into the National Grid.Work could start in 2025 with a completion date of 2028.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
