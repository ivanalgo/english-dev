Guernsey does not have a shortage of blood or blood donors, the island's health and social care committee (HSC) has said. It comes after the NHS in England appealed for people with O-type blood to urgently come forward after blood stocks dropped to "unprecedently low" levels.HSC said the island's donation service has a "more targeted approach" than the UK, adding donors with a specific blood type can be contacted at any time if needed."Thanks to great support from the population, we have no shortage of blood or blood donors on the island," it said.
HSC said its blood donor panel is made up of all blood groups.It said blood is imported from the UK when there is a requirement for special types of blood.HSC said it sees about 80 donors per month and has seen an average of about six new donors per month."All blood donated remains on the Bailiwick for residents and visitors who may require it," it said."In the event of a major emergency, we are able to initiate an urgent donation session and order blood or blood products from the UK.‚Äù
