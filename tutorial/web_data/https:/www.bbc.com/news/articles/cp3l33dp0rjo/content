Ageing Well in the Bailiwick has released a survey as part of its work looking at what islanders need as they grow older. The charity wants to gather the views of people across the Bailiwick of Guernsey in its Transition to Retirement Survey. The survey aims to find out what housing, support and services people would look to the community for as people get older.Chairman David Inglis said the results of the survey would be "a key part of supporting an ageing population".
The study will be used to inform decisions about the services and opportunities available on island, according to the charity. It has asked islanders of all ages, from 18 upwards, to take part in the survey.The charity hopes to get a variety of responses "to understand how younger age groups are preparing for the years to come and eventually for a good retirement".Mr Inglis said the results would be published in a report that would also help identify issues people across the bailiwick were facing now.
