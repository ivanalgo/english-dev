Retired British Olympian Kriss Akabusi has had an appeal against a driving ban rejected.The Olympic silver and bronze medallist, received a six month ban after he was caught travelling at 47mph in a 30mph zone on the Isle of Wight on 20 April 2023.Mr Akabusi appeared at Southampton Crown Court asking for a reduction in his ban due to the "exceptional hardship" it would cause to his career and family life.Despite this defence, the ban, handed to the former athlete in May, has been upheld.
Mr Akabusi told the court that he was on holiday on the island with his son and daughter.The 65-year-old already had nine points on his licence when his Range Rover was captured on the A3054 by a police officer using a radar gun.He said his biggest concern was the impact the ban would have on his 13-year-old daughter who he said has "neurodiverse needs".Mr Akabusi lives alone in Milton Keynes after separating from his daughter's mother.He said he "lives in a rural area and public transport is not good".He admitted that, though he had never travelled by train, the driving ban would make it difficult to visit his child, who is based in Shrewsbury.The former sprinter and hurdler, won silver medal in Los Angeles in 1984 and two bronze medals in Barcelona in 1992. He now works works as a television presenter, occasionally appearing on GB News to review newspapers.He also works as a motivational speaker, travelling to various organisations across the country.When speaking about the impact the driving ban would have on his work, he said it would leave him "in very deep trouble" financially.He added that he is worried about how he would continue to pay for his children's education as both of them currently attend independent schools.
