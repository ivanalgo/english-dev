Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner has denied her intervention in the row over veteran member Diane Abbott forced a change of tack by the Labour leader.Ms Abbott was readmitted to Labour in May, following a lengthy suspension over a race row, and there was speculation she would be barred from running again as an MP for the party.Last week, Sir Keir Starmer said no decision had been made, followed by Ms Rayner saying she "couldn't see any reason" why Ms Abbott couldn't run.Sir Keir later said Ms Abbott was free to stand, and he was attacked by Rishi Sunak, who claimed he had "given in" to his deputy.Tory chairman Richard Holden also posted a photo of the pair taking the knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement from 2020."What Angela Rayner was actually doing here is now clear; teaching Sir Keir to take the knee to her as Labour's first female leader," he claimed on X.
Ms Rayner has denied her comments changed his mind, telling the BBC Sir Keir has always respected Ms Abbott and her "37 years of public service". "She’s a real trailblazer as the first black female MP, and I know from my conversations with Keir he’s always respected that, and it's absolutely not anything to do with me where Keir’s stance is on that," Ms Rayner said.She added: "Keir also believes that we’re a changed Labour party, he believes in processes and there was a process that had to be followed, that Keir wasn’t involved in. "And that’s why Keir was very clear on that, but his respect for Diane Abbott was always there."

Ms Abbott has since said she intends to "run and win" for Labour in the Hackney North and Stoke Newington constituency at this general election.The veteran politician then appeared to post about Sir Keir's "lies" about the affair on X, although the message was deleted within seconds.When asked about that, Ms Rayner said she "didn’t know the circumstances to that, but I know that Keir Starmer hasn’t lied about Diane Abbott".She added she had had conversations with Ms Abbott "where I’ve expressed mine and Keir’s sentiments towards her and that we both believe that her 37 years of service has been incredible".A full list of candidates in Hackney North and Stoke Newington will be available on the BBC News website after nominations close on Friday.
