A Kent council has revealed its preferred plan for local housing in the future. Medway Council wants to build around 11,000 properties in urban centres and on waterfront locations, with suburban and rural areas making up the rest of the calculated target of 22,500 homes by 2041.Other options in the Local Plan include mainly apartments being built in urban areas or a mixture of properties on rural land. Council leader Vince Maple said: "This stage of the Local Plan represents an exciting moment for Medway, as an opportunity for us all to build a picture of a place where we and future generations can thrive over the decades to come."
The Local Plan is also looking at ways to boost jobs, education and infrastructure in a sustainable way for the future with the hopes that more people will use public transport instead of their own vehicles.The council is committed to getting the new Local Plan in place by 2026.Mr Vince said: "Our existing plan was signed off more than 20 years ago so is in desperate need of updating."An eight-week consultation on the Local Plan is expected to be launched from 15 July.
