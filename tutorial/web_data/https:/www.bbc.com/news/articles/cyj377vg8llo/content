The hottest temperature of 2024 so far has been recorded in Essex.On Saturday, people across the country enjoyed the sunshine as temperatures soared above the national average of 13-14C for April. The highest UK temperature of the year so far was 21.8C, recorded in Writtle, near Chelmsford. However, temperatures are expected to drop in the coming week and are not expected to exceed the April average, according to meteorologist Ellie Glaisyer.
“Lower pressure sits out towards the north of the UK, slowly sinking its way southwards – for the rest of the weekend and into the start of the working week, it will bring with it some colder north-westerly winds," she said. Temperatures during the week in Essex are expected to range between 11C and 14C, and there will be gusty wind and showers across the county.
