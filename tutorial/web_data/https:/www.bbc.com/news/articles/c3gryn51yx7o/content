More than 200 bikers have made a care home resident's birthday wish come true.Gary Embleton, who turned 70 this week, was a keen biker in his youth but ill health prevented him from attending a bike meet.Staff at Rivermead Care Home in Malton, North Yorkshire, took to social media in a bid to surprise Mr Embleton and were left "overwhelmed" by the response as dozens arrived to mark the occasion.Mr Embleton's sister, Sam Beal, said the event was "unbelievable and so emotional", adding: "I was in floods for hours."
Home manager Sarah Jackson said: "Gary used to be very good with the racing bikes and quite famous in this area."We had talked about taking him up to Oliver's Mount, to watch the racing bikes, but unfortunately he wasn't well enough."So, we thought we'd bring the bikes to him but I don't think we expected the overwhelming response we got."Ms Beal added: "He's been at Rivermead for four years now and hasn't been well."I just wanted to do something for his birthday."It really brought memories back for Gary."There were tears in his eyes, he was so overcome. It was really a sight to see."
Staff member Nicola Bedford said: "I never thought one small post on Facebook would lead to so many people. "He was just so overcome with joy that it gave a tear to everybody."Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram. Send your story ideas to yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk.
