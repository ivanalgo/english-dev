A weightlifter may have been dead for two days before he was found with a 60kg barbell across his neck, an inquest has heard.Carl Hughes, 60, was lying on a bench in his bedroom when he was discovered.The inquest in Ruthin on Tuesday heard that he lived alone and that neighbours became concerned for his welfare.The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death, saying it was impossible to determine whether a high level of alcohol in his blood had played a part.
Mr Hughes had been working out in his flat in Hanover Court, Rhos on Sea, Conwy county, lifting 60kg (9st 4lb) weights.On Saturday 9 September neighbours noticed that he hadn’t been seen for around two days, and newspaper deliveries hadn’t been picked up.A statement was read out at the inquest from neighbour Philip Colligan, who said that he went into the flat to check on Mr Hughes.“His front door was never locked, so I went inside when he didn’t answer, still calling out to him," he said.“I noticed his bedroom door was shut, so I went inside and he was lying on the weightlifting bench, unresponsive, with a barbell over his neck.”Recording a conclusion of accidental death, assistant coroner Kate Robertson said it was impossible to know whether the weightlifting bar had fallen onto Mr Hughes’ neck, or whether he’d dropped it by accident.A post mortem examination showed there was a high level of alcohol in his blood, but there was no way of knowing whether this contributed to the accident.She said: “This was a terribly tragic set of circumstances, and I send my condolences to Carl Hughes’ family and friends.”
