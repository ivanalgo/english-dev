A convoy of about 200 lorries and recovery vehicles drove down a motorway on Sunday in memory of a popular businessman.David Pickering, from Droitwich, Worcestershire, who owned a vehicle recovery business, died of Covid-related pneumonia earlier this month.The procession set off from Strensham Services on the M5, ending at Berry Hill Industrial Estate in Droitwich."So many people loved Dave... Anybody that popped in, he always had time for them," said colleague Nathan Green.
"This would mean the absolute world to him, just the sheer amount of people that have turned out and come together," he added.
The convoy vehicles blasted their horns and switched on their flashing lights to honour Mr Pickering, while dozens of people watched on an overpass.Another colleague, Simon Griffiths, said: "He meant a lot to everybody. Everybody had respect for him, he had respect for everybody else."If anybody wanted help, he would go out of his way to make sure you got that help you needed, whatever it was for."
