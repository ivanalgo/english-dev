A local authority has launched a 12-month push to fix potholes and drainage issues across a county.Staffordshire County Council announced £8m of investment to get road defects repaired more quickly as well as making other improvements to the network.As part of the scheme, the drainage system would be improved in preparation for more extreme weather events, the authority said.The announcement came after the council previously confirmed £53m would be spent on a range of highways projects in 2024 and 2025.
Councillor Mark Deaville, cabinet member for strategic highways, said road crews’ “fantastic progress” had been “washed away” by one of the wettest winters on record.He described potholes and poor drainage as a "nuisance", adding that focusing on these two areas would help to solve issues more quickly. “This plan is our commitment to making our roads better for our residents, and our crews will be pulling out all the stops to repair as many potholes and drainage issues as they can,” he said.
