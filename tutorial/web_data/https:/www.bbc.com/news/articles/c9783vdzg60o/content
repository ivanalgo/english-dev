A consultation over the proposed closure of a school has been described as a "tick-box exercise" by a parent who claims the council has "no intention" of keeping it open.Gateshead Council is considering shutting Colegate Community Primary School in Felling, but said no decision had been taken.An online petition to keep it open has more than 2,000 signatures.Kathryn Craig, whose son goes to the school, said other options to save the school, such as reducing staff or class sizes, have been "thrown out".
Ms Craig said: "They [parents] feel it's been a tick-box exercise to seem like they're taking into account the parents views."But, realistically, I think they all know what the outcome to be."I don't think they have any intention to keep Colegate open."According to council reports, the school has low pupil numbers and a £209,000 deficit, predicted to reach £350,000 by the next financial year.
Ms Craig said the site was a "second home" for its pupils but she had transferred her son to a different school from September, as had many other parents."My little boy has autism, so the whole idea of uprooting and starting a new routine is quite scary for him," she said.She said she wished the council would change its mind."They've looked at the financial situation rather than the bigger picture, which is the community, the kids and the teachers," she said.
Council service director for education Suzanne Dunn said "no decision" had been made to close the school."Cabinet last week agreed to consult around closure, and this is now happening," she said.She urged parents to voice any concerns through the consultation process and added "engagement sessions" were being held with those whose children would be affected if the school eventually closed.The consultation runs until 24 July and a final decision will be made in September.
