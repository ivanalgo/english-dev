Plans to regenerate part of a former mining town in Derbyshire are set to be approved.Chesterfield Borough Council wants to build a pavilion to house a new library, business centre, and public toilets in Staveley's market place.The council said the scheme would be funded using part of a Â£25.2m Town Deal grant.The council's own planning committee is to discuss the scheme when it meets on Monday. 
Officials have recommended councillors on the committee approve the development which would see an existing public toilet block demolished to make way for the new building.The authority said it wanted to create a "landmark" building on what was currently an underused and unattractive site.If approved, the project would see the town's existing library, in Hill Lane, relocated.In documents supporting the planning application, the council said: "The existing market place creates a poor perception of Staveley and fails to encourage people to visit the rest of the town centre. "This proposal aims to redevelop and enhance the [area] by creating a social outdoor events space to promote activity within the market place."
Other projects proposed as part of Staveley's Town Deal include the development of the Derbyshire Rail Industry Innovation Vehicle (DRIIVe) - a rail innovation and training centre in Barrow Hill - and the re-opening of the nearby railway station.A restoration of a 850m (0.52 mile) of the Chesterfield Canal is also propsed and the renovation of  Staveley Miners Welfare Football Club's clubhouse as a sports education centre,The council said it hoped to complete the town deal projects by March 2026.
