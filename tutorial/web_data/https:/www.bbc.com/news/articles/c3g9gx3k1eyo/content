This week work started on the site of Radio 1's Big Weekend and Luton Borough Council hopes the festival will prove the town can host world class events.James Taylor, the council's portfolio holder for regeneration and inclusive growth, said he was most looking forward to watching Vampire Weekend at the Stockwood Park Event which begins on 24 May.He said: "[Luton is] getting national recognition after a great season from the football team, to have this at the end of the season is absolutely fantastic."
More than 40% of the tickets for the Stockwood Park event have gone to people living in or near the Bedfordshire town.The remaining tickets have been purchased by people across the country who will visit Luton over the late May Bank Holiday weekend.Mr Taylor said "other towns have had over Â£3m of economic activity over the weekend" which he hopes can be replicated in the home of the Hatters. He said: "All the restaurants, pubs, hotels are all excited, they're getting in the spirit and showing off our town and that Luton is capable of holding some of these world class events."
Big Weekend takes place between 24 May and 26 May,The event will be headlined by Chase & Status, Raye and Coldplay.Standing outside the construction site of the festival, Mr Taylor said: "I can't believe how quick the guys have worked, there was nothing here a few days ago and now it's a mass of activity."
