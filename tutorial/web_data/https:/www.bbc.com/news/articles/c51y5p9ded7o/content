A council hopes to bring a High Street back to life by playing music to shoppers through outdoor speakers. Huntingdon Town Council said it would use the speaker system for special events like its Halloween Trail, during its Armistice services and around Christmas.It is hoped music will create a welcoming atmosphere and encourage footfall across the town centre.Communications officer at the council, Sarah Jane Gaule, said one of the first songs to make its way through the system, which was used for the first time on Saturday, was by the Spice Girls.The system also played Disney tunes to support the town's "Once Upon a Time Day".
Ms Gaule told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire the music "transformed you into another world".She said: "We haven't got to the part where we are pumping in smells [like at Disneyland], but if we can just make it a bit more of a welcoming place to be, then why not?"We don't want to disturb anyone, so we need it to be subtle and balanced. We think we have got it right, but if there are any issues people can come to us and let us know."Karl Brockett, mayor of Huntingdon, added he was "delighted" to have the system, to promote "an improved shopping and visiting experience". In total there are 21 speakers that can also act as a tool to communicate with the public, if necessary.There are 13 situated along the High Street between the Market Square and 138 High Street, and eight have been placed along St Germain Walk and Chequers Court.The speakers were bought using grant funding through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund.
