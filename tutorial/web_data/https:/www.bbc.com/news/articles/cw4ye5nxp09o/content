A 10-year-old girl has climbed England’s tallest mountain in memory of her father to raise money for Les Bourgs Hospice where he was cared for.Isabella's father, Stephen, had planned on climbing Scafell Pike before he started chemotherapy. After he died, Isabella decided to take on the nearly 1,000m (3,281ft) peak in the Lake District alongside her mother and uncle, raising more than £3,500 for the hospice.She said "I am happy I have raised lots of money and this is proof you can do anything you put your mind to."
Isabella was set to climb the mountain the day earlier but due to poor weather conditions, they had to delay the attempt to Wednesday. Before climbing, she said: "I know my daddy will be very happy and when I reach the top he will be very proud of me."He will be laughing at my mother, we are going to leave bottles of champagne for her halfway down to convince her to keep going."As part of her training, Isabella had already managed to reach the 251m (823ft) summit of Arthur's Seat, an ancient volcano in Edinburgh, Scotland.Liz Stonebridge, fundraising manager at Les Bourgs Hospice, said: "Our nursing team takes pride to ensure that the highest standard of compassionate, holistic care is provided to our patients and their families."We are very grateful to Isabella and her support team for raising funds for us and wish her the best of luck."
