Thousands of trees are being offered for free as part of a scheme aimed at getting more planted in a county to boost wildlife.Saplings are being offered in Shropshire to residents, farmers and schools as well as charities and businesses.Shropshire Council said the scheme would focus on planting groups of native trees and shrubs as copses and small areas of woodland.People will also have the option to plant small amounts of native hedgerow to close gaps in existing hedgerows - or to create short new ones where needed.
The trees can be ordered online and come in bundles of 20 with planting and aftercare instructions, the authority said.Last year, 11,600 trees were sent out to be planted out across Shropshire, the council added.
