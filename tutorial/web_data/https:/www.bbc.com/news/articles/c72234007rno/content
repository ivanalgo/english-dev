Police previously said there were four people in the car, which was driving "well above" the speed limit when it struck Keaton, and that they believed Mr Aleksanders was the driver.Mr Aleksanders, who was born in Latvia but is a UK resident, was living in the Coventry area at the time of the crash, police said.“A young boy has tragically lost his life and has left a devastating impact on so many people, especially Keaton's family and friends," said Alan Edwards from Crimestoppers.“Our charity is supporting the police as they hunt for Aleksanders by offering a reward. "We are reminding everyone, especially those who may be intimidated into silence, that they have the option to stay completely anonymous when contacting us."People have been advised they should not approach Mr Aleksanders, and should instead contact the police, or Crimestoppers if they wish to stay anonymous.
