Children brought cheer to their circle of elderly friends during a poignant visit to a care home this week.Three and four-year-olds from Thornaby's Montessori People nursery are regular visitors to the Woodside Grange home.Now preparing to move up to primary school, the children paid a final visit to their friends on Tuesday and handed over portraits they had drawn in their likeness.Resident Maureen Hopkins, 86, said: "I've been feeling a bit down recently, but seeing their smiling faces has cheered me up."
"I just love the children's visits," she added."I've got grandchildren myself but they're grown up now and live down south, so I don't see much of them."
The children's visit, which took place during Loneliness Awareness Week, gave them the opportunity to say goodbye to the residents.Their regular visits have shaped relationships which have been beneficial to both generations, the nursery and care home staff said."All our pre-schoolers wanted to see the residents before they move up to primary school, so we thought what better time than during Loneliness Awareness Week?" nursery manager Cheryl Lambert said. "Connecting people across different generations is hugely beneficial. Some of the older residents don't have grandchildren and some of the children no longer have grandparents, so it’s a win-win. "Everyone had such a great time – the smiles on the residents’ faces say it all."Barbara Parker, manager at Woodside Grange, said the children brought a "different vibe" to the home and gave its residents a "real pick-me-up"."They love to chat to the children and often reminisce about their own life stories," she added.
