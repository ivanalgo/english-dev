New traffic lights are set to be installed on a busy Derby road in 2025.A new traffic crossing is planned at the junction of Kedleston Road and Allestree Lane near The Markeaton pub, in Allestree.According to Derby City Council, the creation of the controversial crossing comes as part of a planning condition following the development of hundreds of new homes at Kedleston Road by developer Miller Homes.The scheme has previously faced criticism that the lights would lead to queuing traffic.
However the authority says the lights could help tackle speeding on Allestree Lane.A spokesperson told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: “The plans to install traffic lights at the junction between Kedleston Road and Allestree Lane are part of the planning conditions for the nearby housing development on Kedleston Road, set by the planning inspector.“Once complete, this scheme will improve safety for both pedestrians and cyclists through the introduction of pedestrian crossings. Work on this is expected to be completed in 2025.”Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram. Send your story ideas to eastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk or via WhatsApp on 0808 100 2210.
