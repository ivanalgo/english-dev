More tests should have been done on a man who died two weeks after being attacked outside a pub, a court has heard.Daniel Bradley was kicked, punched and pushed to the ground on 9 September last year near The Brogden, on New Road, Porthcawl, in Bridgend county.The 32-year-old died at the Princess of Wales hospital on 23 September.He suffered a displaced fracture on the right of his ribs, a chest infection which led to sepsis, and a brain injury caused by oxygen deprivation.
Steven Chappell, 29, from Cwmdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, has denied murder and manslaughter at Cardiff Crown Court.Clinician and consultant radiologist, Dr Colin Ferrett, reviewed the hospital documents relating to Mr Bradley's care.
He said an X-ray in Mr Bradley's notes dated 11 September showed a "lighter circular appearance" near the rib fracture, which he believed was likely to be a haematoma. That relates to localised bleeding but, the doctor added, it could also have signalled problems including infection.Peter Rouch KC, defending, asked if that could be left without further tests. "Absolutely not, the abnormalities on that chest X-ray necessitated further investigation," said Dr Ferrett. He added that a CT scan of Mr Bradley's chest was required.This was not done.Mr Bradley was discharged with painkillers but readmitted a couple of days later after his mother dialled 999. She told police her son's lips had turned blue and he believed someone was outside his bedroom window with a machete.Dr Ferrett told the jury he believed Mr Bradley may have contracted a "potentially very life threatening" strep A infection before he came to hospital on 11 September.That, he said, was something which could have been treated with antibiotics.Previously the court heard Mr Chappell would not be giving evidence.The case continues.
