The interception of a gun sent from China to the UK sparked a police investigation which has ended with a man being jailed for five years.Sheffield Crown Court heard how Robbie Fardell's home in Park Road, Mexborough, was raided in July 2023 after Border Force officials discovered the package.During the search, a Taser, an air gun, ammunition as well as multiple World War Two knives were found.Fardell, 39, pleaded guilty to several firearms offences and was sentenced on Friday.
The court heard some of the items discovered during the search had been found in and around the bed Fardell shared with his then-wife and, on occasion, his young child.Fardell also owned several zombie knives, German Wehrmacht knives, a deactivated sawn-off shotgun, volatile chemicals, knuckle dusters, batons, air pistols and "toy guns".Officers also found a book on firearms and ammunition and a 3D printer alongside a template for shotgun construction.Fardell was subsequently charged with two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, possession of ammunition for a firearm without a certificate and possession of a firearm.There was also a summary charge of bringing an imitation firearm into the UK which related to a so-called "ghost-folding deformation revolver".
The court heard how Fardell had described himself as an "engineer, a welder and armourer" on his Facebook page.He claimed he had bought the paintball gun for target practice and said the ammunition found had been "a birthday present for display purposes".The Recorder of Sheffield, Judge Jeremy Richardson KC, told the court the situation would have been different had the paintball gun been held alone by "an unsuspecting member of the public".He told Fardell: "This weapon was not a toy, it was not employed for that purpose."The court heard Fardell suffered from a number of mental health issues.Sentencing him, Judge Richardson told him: "I am concerned with the other items found in your home, which display in my judgement an unhealthy mindset. "Particularly when this is coupled with the mental health problems from which you suffer."As well as the jail sentence, the judge ordered the destruction of the items found in Fardell's home.One count of importing a prohibited weapon or ammunition with intent to evade a prohibition or restriction would remain on file, the court was told.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
