A mother whose baby's life was drastically improved by a liver transplant has encouraged people to "have a chat" with loved ones about organ donation.Jen said without his donor and a medical team at Birmingham Children's Hospital, Henry, now one, "wouldn't be here".He was diagnosed with biliary atresia shortly after birth, which occurs when ducts which carry bile from the liver to the gall bladder become blocked.Jen, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, said the conversation about donation "could save someone's life".
Henry was sent for tests after newborn jaundice failed to clear and transferred to the hospital's specialist liver unit when he was three weeks old."He was quickly seen by lots of specialists and doctors," Jen said. "It was quite overwhelming. I was so upset and worried."A medical procedure to help the bile drain from his liver into the gut only worked temporarily and doctors decided Henry needed a transplant."It felt like a very long wait, though in hindsight, we weren't waiting too long," his mum said. "We were just very anxious waiting for that phone call which we knew we could receive at any time."When it came, Henry had a seven-hour transplant operation the day after the call.Jen said the improvement was immediate and "we couldn't believe it was working so quickly". 
Now home, Henry is thriving and recently enjoyed his first family holiday.Jen described his medical team as "incredible" and "part of our family"."We are just so grateful to our donor. It's such a selfless thing for them and their family to do," she added."Thanks to them, he is happy and living as a one-year-old should."She encouraged people to "have the chat about organ donation" with loved ones."That conversation could save someone's life, just like Henry’s," she added.
Kylie Martin, a liver nurse specialist at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, said Henry was "an amazing young boy"."To see him now with his smile and character lights up our day," she added.The hospital said there were currently more than 7,600 people in the UK waiting for a transplant.
