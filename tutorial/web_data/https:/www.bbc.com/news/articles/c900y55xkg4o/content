A by-election is due to be held in Torbay on Thursday following the death of a councillor.The council is finely balanced as it is under Conservative control but without any party having a clear majority.Of the 36 seats on the council, currently the Conservatives have 17, the Liberal Democrats have 15 with two Independent councillors and one from Prosper Torbay.The Wellswood by-election was prompted by the death of Prosper Torbay councillor Patrick Joyce.
At a hustings debate organised by the Wellswood Community Partnership issues raised included anti-social behaviour and protecting green spaces.Conservative candidate Hazel Foster said there were "issues that needed resolving" in the area.She said: "Whether it's the potholes, anti-social behaviour, speeding - I've been listening to what residents have had to say."Ms Foster said she would "take those messages to the council and make sure the council has listened".
The Liberal Democrat candidate Peter Fenton said he had lived in the ward for 25 years.He said: "I've managed some of the biggest customer service operations in the country, both in the private sector and the public sector."I've got experience of managing projects up to Â£30m and I want to use that experience to help this council tackle the issues that it faces both here in Wellswood and across the bay."
Jonathan Chant-Stevens is the Labour candidate for Wellswood.He is 19 years old and said he was offering "a fresh voice on the council".He said: "We've had Conservatives and Liberal Democrats here for a very long time and wherever I go in Wellswood people are telling me it's time for a change."It's time for somebody who's going to move the town forward and deal with the issues here."
The Reform UK candidate, Mike Lister, said his background in running small businesses and as a business lecturer would help him as a councillor.He said: "I know how to read a spreadsheet, I know how to read a  set of accounts and I think the council needs a lot more scrutiny."
Paul Moor, standing for the Workers Party of Britain, said he wanted to make Torbay a "beautiful thriving community once again".The BBC approached the Green Party candidate Jenny Giel for comment.
