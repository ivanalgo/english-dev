A man has graduated 41 years late after a rent dispute with his former university.Jonny Clothier was forced to leave a student flat in 1983 when it was damaged by a friend's parrot that had been left unsupervised.He failed to pay the outstanding Â£64.80 in rent to the University of Bristol, which subsequently denied him access to his degree ceremony.Mr Clothier, 62, from Petersfield, Hampshire, was finally allowed to graduate on Thursday on the same day as his youngest son.
A long-since abolished rule meant that students with unpaid accommodation bills were awarded degrees but were not allowed to graduate.Mr Clothier jokingly said he viewed the unpaid rent as an "ultra-long-term, interest-free loan".As an undergraduate he met his future wife at the university, which was later also attended by all three of his children.The former TV director said: "We are so proud of them because they've all done so well - I literally take my strange, new, flat hat off to them."
He added that his graduation day on Thursday had been "enormous fun".His son Carter, 21, who completed a biology degree, said: "It's definitely a unique experience graduating with your dad, but it was an amazing day and a beautiful ceremony."The university said it had decided to forgive the debt.Its vice-chancellor, Prof Evelyn Welch, said: "We are so pleased that Jonny, Carter and the rest of the family had such a great day and we wish them all the best of luck in the future."
