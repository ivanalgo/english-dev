A celebrity tailor from Brighton will be joined by the stars at the launch of an exhibition in memory of his father, who recently died from Alzheimer’s disease.Gresham Blake founded his tailoring business in 2000 and has since designed clothing for the likes of Ray Winstone, Danny Dyer, Steve Coogan and Romesh Ranganathan – all of whom will be at the city’s Helm Gallery on Thursday evening, along with founding member of the band Squeeze, Chris Difford.“[My father] passed away just over a year ago from [Alzheimer’s] after a seven-year gradual decline,” Gresham said of father, Brian Blake.“He used to say ‘remind me why I’m here’, which is the title of the show.”
Artist Kevin McCracken has produced portraits of Gresham’s clients which will be sold at the exhibition alongside embroidery designed by Gresham's mother, Adrienne Blake, to raise money for Alzheimer's Research UK.
“The story of my dad’s decline into Alzheimer’s is just one of millions,” said Gresham. “It’s great to have an opportunity to do something in his name and help support such a worthwhile cause.“It’s very difficult to put into words, I watched him die twice. My mother knew my dad since she was 16. She’s in bits, she’s lost half of her.”Adrienne said that her husband “slipped into his own reality” and began to lose his coordination about five years ago.“His colours faded, as did he, and I’ve been reflecting that in my art, working more in black and white,” she said.Scott Mitchell, an ambassador for Alzheimer’s Research UK and husband of the late Barbara Windsor - who died from Alzheimer’s in 2020 – will also be at the exhibition launch.Money from the artwork sold at the exhibition and the following prints will be donated to Alzheimer’s Research UK.
