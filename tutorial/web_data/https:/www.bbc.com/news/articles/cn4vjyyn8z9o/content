Plans for a proposed slurry lagoon on a farm have been approved.The hole in the ground, which stores animal waste to be used as fertiliser, has been granted for a site at Hill House Nook near Dalston, Cumbria, by Cumberland Councilâ€™s planning department.The lagoon will measure 120ft (36m) by 75ft (23m) in area and be 12ft (3.75m) deep, and will be filled from the livestock buildings to the east of the site.A planning report stated there would be no likely significant effect on any habitat sites or any nearby Site of Scientific Interest.
The Local Democracy Reporting Service said a report stated the siting was considered as the development was "located within an area subject to nutrient neutrality", a means of ensuring that it would not add to existing nutrient burdens within catchments.The proposals included the use of slurry bugs, to reduce the amount of agitation needed to create fertiliser, and a floating cover.
The council report also stated Natural England had "confirmed" that if the site was properly maintained, there would be "no likely significant effect on any habitat sites".The approval was granted because it allowed the farm's "future expansion", for which there were "no other possible options".
