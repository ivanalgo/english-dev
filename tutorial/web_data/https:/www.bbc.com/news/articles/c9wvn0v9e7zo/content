A group fighting to save a run-down theatre in Berkshire has said it is confident of meeting the fundraising deadline to buy the building.Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead (RBWM) gave campaigners until the end of October to raise the £300,000 needed to buy the Novello Theatre in Sunninghill.Save Novello Picture House said it had so far raised £250,000, including a £100,000 anonymous donation.It said it was also in talks with actor Sir Kenneth Branagh about the campaign and its future plans for the theatre.
Sir Kenneth, who is from Reading, has been supporting efforts to save the 100-year-old venue from redevelopment.In an update, campaign co-ordinator Alan Everett said the generosity of local donors had provided "the best possible start" towards the initial fundraising target."It is thanks to this solid foundation that we are confident we will meet RBWM’s asking price of £300,000," he said."We also spent a productive hour on the phone with the ever-helpful Sir Kenneth Branagh who offered guidance that accelerated the next steps of our campaign and will further hone down the future vision and offering of the Novello."
The group is planning a number of fundraising events, including an outdoor cinema at Broomhall Park on 14 September, in partnership with Sunningdale Parish Council.The theatre in High Street was registered as an Asset of Community Value in April, giving local groups six months to raise the funds before it could be offered on the open market.Save Novello Picture House wants to restore the theatre, linking it with neighbouring Cordes Hall under a single charity.Renovations to the building are expected to cost a further £300,000 to £500,000, in addition to the purchase price.
