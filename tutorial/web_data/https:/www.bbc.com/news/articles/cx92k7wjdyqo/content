A cricket club is attempting to break a world record during a game to celebrate its 150th anniversary.Alsager Cricket Club will attempt to beat the record for the longest run-up for the first ball bowled in a cricket match - with a 10km (6.2 mile) run-up on Friday evening.The club's right arm bowler, Sam Goodwin, started the challenge in Tunstall.He will pass through Kidsgrove and Sandyford on his way to deliver the opening ball at the club before the game begins at about 18:00 BST.
The current world record for the longest bowling run-up stands at a distance of 7.8km.Speaking to BBC Radio Stoke, Goodwin said it was a "great opportunity" and an "unusual record" to attempt.He said he previously "did a lot of running" but had not ran as much recently."I just think it's something that it would be great to be a part of," he said, "and I suppose it will be a funny feeling if I do get in world record books."I've had a few saying I hope you don't bowl a no ball or a wide, so we'll have to see about that one," he said.The club's chairman, Alan Stancliffe, said they wanted to do something "special" to mark the 150 year anniversary.He said Goodwin was a "total athlete" who had been training for weeks."He's got no problem, he'll complete it and he'll bowl that first ball," Mr Stancliffe said. "He'll probably get the batsman out as well."
