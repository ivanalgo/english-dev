Councillors have called for tougher sanctions for developers who flout planning restrictions, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.It comes after hundreds of residents of Crofton Grange in Blyth, Northumberland, signed a petition raising concerns about the 850-home development, built by Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon.The petition asks developers to finish road surfacing, repair kerb stones and build the play area that was part of the original plans.The developers said a programme of remedial work was being completed. 
At a meeting of the Ashington and Blyth Local Area Council on Wednesday, members were told that the council was in a difficult position because the roads were still private and have not yet been adopted by the council. Planning officer Judith Murphy explained: “Our hands are tied a little bit. Until we have more control there’s very little we can do.”The issues at Crofton Grange follow a number of similar issues at large-scale housing developments across the area.Caroline Ball represents the Ashington central ward and said: "Residents are being left high and dry."There doesn’t seem to be any clout, it just doesn’t feel right," she added. 
Eileen Cartie, who represents Wensleydale, Blyth, said: “I think we have got a lack of enforcement powers. It’s spiralling out of control."The committee agreed to raise their concerns with the working group for the Northumberland Local Plan, which looks at planning policy.In September, Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon issued a joint statement claiming that a programme of remedial work was being completed.At the time, contractors had been appointed to carry out works including the completion of the roads and footpaths as well as the construction of the play area.
