Long-awaited plans to transform a town centre have finally been announced.Oldham council and city developers Muse have revealed details of the revamp for five "key areas" in the Greater Manchester borough.The council is inviting residents to have their say on the initial ideas, which include building 2,000 new homes to address the town’s housing crisis and creating a dedicated "retail core", "cultural quarter" and "education quarter".The developers have promised to deliver the changes in a phased approach over the next 15 years.
Council boss Arooj Shah said it was an “exciting milestone” for the town and said she aimed to create a town centre that is “fit for the future”.The five locations identified by Muse for redevelopment are a "civic and residential Quarter" around the town hall, a "retail core" around Spindles, the "creative quarter" near the Coliseum, Mumps and the town’s western edge.Documents published by Muse show the area around the Civic Centre becoming 600 new homes in a series of C-shaped residential blocks. The Queen Elizabeth Hall would need to be bulldozed, but the "landmark" Civic Centre tower would remain, and might be repurposed as a hotel.Further into town, another new neighbourhood with 225 homes will take the place of the demolished Magistrates Court, and 250 new homes are due to be added on what was once the site of Oldham’s leisure centre, demolished in 2016.
The neighbouring Manchester Chambers, near George Square, will be refurbished for commercial uses such as retail, cafes, gyms or restaurants, with offices on the upper floors.The plans have a clear focus on housing but Muse have also put forward suggestions for the "retail core" of the town with Henshaw House on Cheapside to house new shops and restaurants alongside a number of new homes.The council is holding drop-in events in the next few weeks where residents can share their opinions.
