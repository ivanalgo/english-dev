A public electric bike service has been suspended in Inverness service after "relentless vandalism" left just six of its 56 bikes in the city available for use.Hi-Bike's Fort William bikes have also been targeted.  The cost of recent vandalism to the scheme, which was set up three years ago, runs to £50,000.In the past few days across Inverness and Fort William, eight of Hi-Bike's £4,000 bikes have been stolen and about 20 damaged.British Transport Police said it was investigating damage to bikes at a hub at Inverness Railway Station.
Bikes have been found crashed and broken, while others have been thrown into rivers and the Caledonian Canal.In Inverness, bikes have been damaged by people attempting to wrenching them out of charging stations.
Hi-Bike was set up in 2021 by regional public transport body Hitrans and it has 112 bikes.Rentals are available for 30 minutes to three hours, and people can also sign up for monthly or an annual memberships.Prices for using the bikes range from £2.50 to £80, and they can be rented via an app.Hitrans said the scheme had been popular with local residents and visitors.There have been almost 40,000 "rides" since its launch three years ago, and there are plans to expand it to other locations, including Inverness' Raigmore Hospital.Last week, Hi-Bike was highly commended in the transport team of the year category at the Scottish Transport Awards.
Hitrans said there had been a "huge surge" in vandalism since the Easter school holidays.It said there had also been incidents involving young people sitting in the front baskets of bikes while being pedalled through Inverness city centre, sometimes against the flow of traffic.
Ranald Robertson, partnership director at Hitrans, said: "It is disappointing that a small minority of people are misusing the system.  "Those who choose to ride the bikes with others sitting in the basket will have their membership suspended should this be reported, while any and all incidents of vandalism are being reported to Police Scotland and the British Transport Police.”A British Transport Police spokesperson said: “Officers are investigating reports of damage to bikes at Inverness railway station. "Inquiries are ongoing and anyone with information can contact British Transport Police."
