A week of celebrations is taking place to mark the 21st birthday of a hospice's  children and young adults service.The Newcastle-based St Oswald's Hospice has been providing specialist short breaks and end of life care for babies and children in Northumberland, Tyneside Sunderland and County Durham since 2003. It opened as a result of a fundraising campaign, the Jigsaw Appeal which began in 1999. This year construction work started on a new £1.3m development for young adults at the hospice after St Oswald's extended its care to those up to age of 25. 
The service provides round-the-clock care as well as activities such as accessible surfing, music therapy and trips to local farms and theatres.Hayden, aged 10, who has epilepsy has been coming to the hospice for short breaks for the last seven years. Mum Bethany said: "He loves coming to see his friends and his brothers enjoy events at the hospice, too."The staff are amazing to all of us and you feel the love as soon as you walk in."
In 2023, it launched its children and young adults’ outreach service, to help more families in their homes.Director of care, Angela Egdell, said: “We’re incredibly proud of how far we have come in the last 21 years and know the difference we make to young people’s lives.“But we know we can’t rest on our laurels and we are always looking at how we can improve the excellent care we offer to young people and their families and carers."
