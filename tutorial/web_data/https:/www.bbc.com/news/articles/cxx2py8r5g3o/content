A school in East Sussex has raised more than £100,000 for a cancer charity in memory of student Sophie Maria Taylor, from Hastings. St Richard's Catholic College in Bexhill has held a secret art auction every two years to fundraise for The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity in honour of Sophie who died when she was 13. For the most recent auction, celebrities, artists, pupils, and the public donated more than 2,000 postcards of unique artwork, which were auctioned on eBay at the end of June.Sophie’s parents James and Luiza Taylor said: "We find great comfort in the knowledge that this auction is directly helping the Royal Marsden support other young people in their fight against cancer.”
Secret postcards were created and donated by celebrities including Fearne Cotton, Joe Lycett, Lorraine Kelly, Rev. Richard Cole, and Prue Leith.The list of contributors was available before the auction but buyers only found out who created their art once bidding had ended.Children’s author and illustrator Thomas Taylor helped raise more than £4,000 with his artwork named "Wizards".Sophie's parents said she found "great solace in art" when she was having her treatment.They added: "We are sure she would be very proud of everyone involved."
Previous auctions had raised about £82,500 since the initiative started in 2018, a year after Sophie died. Art teacher and organiser Miranda Pennington said the money was still being counted and could come close to £110,000.She said: “I am astounded by the amount raised. I was hoping to raise £30,000 this year."
