Students have hit out at a university’s decision to scrap a free bus service between its campuses.The University of Wolverhampton confirmed the inter-campus buses between its Wolverhampton, Walsall and Telford sites will end on 31 July.The students’ union said it was “disheartened” by the decision, adding that the service was important for students.The university said the cost was “difficult to justify” and its priority was to enhance students’ experience by investing in facilities on campus.
In a statement posted on Facebook, the students' union said: “We are very disheartened to learn that the University of Wolverhampton has decided to terminate its inter-campus free bus service from 31 July without any consultation with the students’ union (SU) or students, who of course are our members.“The SU strongly objects to the removal of this service, recognising its importance in helping students to travel.”
The union said it would hold the university to account on its decision and ensure a solution was put in place to “minimise the impact” on its members.The university indicated it would look at “broader hardship issues” and the SU would work with decision makers on this, the statement continued.“Nevertheless, this does not address the core issue that the long-standing free bus service will soon be discontinued, with no replacement in sight,” the group added.
A number of students took to social media to voice their objection, with one describing it as “ridiculous”.Another said: “Well, there goes plans for Masters in Telford after finishing next year.“A lot of students who were planning on staying with the university, knowing they could get to Telford, will now look to go to BCU [Birmingham City University].”
A university spokesperson confirmed the “difficult decision” to stop the service had been taken.They said the university had looked at the usage data and worked out that each bus trip was costing approximately £10.“Our priority is to enhance the student academic experience and invest in student services and facilities on campus which makes this cost difficult to justify,” the spokesperson added.“We are working closely with staff and students who use the bus service to ensure they are supported in finding alternative ways to travel between our campuses.”
