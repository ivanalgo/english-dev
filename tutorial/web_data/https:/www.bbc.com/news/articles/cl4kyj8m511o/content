A blood cancer patient has inspired a stem cell donor drive in his community.Kevin McPike, 37, from Brotton, near Saltburn, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in February.His older brother, Michael, was found to be match and the dad-of-two hopes to receive a transplant following chemotherapy treatment.Friend Nicola Fletcher-Borell said the event on Saturday was held to help "someone else live their life a little bit longer".
People gathered at Brotton Community Hall to sign-up to become stem cell donors.The event was organised by Mr McPike's friends and family through blood cancer charity DKMS, which said registering was quick and easy involving a mouth swab.Anyone aged between 17 and 55 and in good health is eligible to join its register.
Mr McPike, who is being treated at James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough, was said to be "gobsmacked" by the turnout."He tries to see the humorous side of things, so he just thinks we are all daft as a brush really, but he knows that we are there for him and that's why we are doing it," Ms Fletcher-Borell added."There's a very small percentage of the UK population that are on the register so if we can just increase that percentage by a little bit more then that is our job done, we have achieved something and hopefully helped someone else live their life a little bit longer."
Louise Clague, from DKMS, said only 7% of the UK population was on the stem cell register but every 20 minutes somebody else was diagnosed with blood cancer."Not all of them will need stem cell transplants," she said, "but lots of them do and at the minute four out of 10 people don't find their match."So what they are doing, swabbing, is brilliant as it helps those numbers."
