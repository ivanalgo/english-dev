A man who stabbed a partygoer in Shetland in a row over money has been jailed for seven years for attempted murder.Stephen Savage, 50, attacked Ross Sutherland in Lerwick in September 2022.A court was told Savage had three previous convictions for assaults with weapons.Savage was sentenced at the High Court in Dundee following a trial in Glasgow last month.
The trial heard that Savage had travelled from Glasgow to Shetland claiming he was going on a fishing holiday with a friend of his cousin, although the man later denied knowing him.Savage and the man were invited to a party where alcohol and drugs, including cocaine, were being taken.Guests at the party said Savage, who had also taken cocaine, had "bad vibes" and a fight had broken out.The trial heard that Mr Sutherland had been blamed for money going missing.
During a struggle, Savage had taken a knife with a 20cm blade from the kitchen, and stabbed Mr Sutherland in the chest.One witness described a "loud frenzy" as he tried to protect himself.The victim had fled the property to his girlfriend's home, where she saw blood pumping from a hole in his chest.Mr Sutherland was airlifted to hospital in Aberdeen.Judge Lord Harrower said: "If it wasn't for the medical attention, Mr Sutherland surely would have died."Det Insp Calum Reid, of Police Scotland, added: â€œThis was an extremely violent offence that left his victim with life-threatening injuries."Our thoughts remain with his victim and his family who were all affected by this crime. I hope this brings them some comfort as Savage now faces the consequences of his reckless actions."
Allan Macleod, defending, said: "He (Savage) knows he is going to get a significant custodial sentence today."He understands the physical and psychological impact of this incident on the complainer."Savage, from Glasgow, had previously been jailed for four-and-a-half years in 2012 for an unprovoked attack outside a primary school in the city.Lord Harrower told Savage, who appeared by video link from prison, that he had been deemed a high risk by social workers.He said: "The gravity of this crime means a lengthy sentence is necessary."He imposed a seven-year prison sentence with a further three years supervision on Savage's release from jail.
