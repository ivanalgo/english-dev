An empty pub could be transformed into a community centre.The Cross Keys in Erdington, Birmingham, closed in 2017. Previous applications to turn it into shared housing and flats were refused.Erdington Islamic Foundation (EIF) has lodged plans to turn the pub into a "local community and education centre with ancillary prayer facility". The plans have been  recommended for approval.The EIF Facebook page said its vision was to "foster an outstanding community that inspires excellence in knowledge, and awakens the spirit of service to others."
If approved, the proposed development would only see changes to the inside of the building. There would be two multi-use halls, toilets, a kitchen and store. On the first floor, there would be four classrooms, a meeting room, library, office and staff kitchen.A council report said those in favour of the application pointed to the potential social benefits and lack of community facilities in the area.However, concerns had been raised about the "loss of a public house" and "increased noise and public nuisance."The report said the proposed community facilities would perform "social and community functions to mitigate the loss of the public house."
It continued: "The impact of the proposed use would be unlikely to be significantly greater than the baseline conditions for noise and disturbance which currently exist."
It recommended the plans for approval subject to conditions, including one which would limit hours of operation.The application will be considered by Birmingham City Councilâ€™s planning committee on Thursday.
