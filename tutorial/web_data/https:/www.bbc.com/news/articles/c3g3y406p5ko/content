The ruling Conservative group on Cornwall Council has "lost its way," a councillor who quit the party has said. Adrian Harvey, who represents St Newlyn East, Cubert and Goonhavern handed in his resignation on Thursday. He is the second person to leave the party this week - costing them their official majority on authority as they now hold 43 of the 87 seats.The BBC has approached the leader of the council, Linda Taylor, and the Conservative group for comment. 
Mr Harvey said it had not been an easy decision but he had been unhappy with the leadership for a number of months.He said: "It is Linda Taylorâ€™s leadership I have got a problem with. She is not a very good people manager."What has happened over the last week has pushed me to resign. I was very upset with the way John Conway was treated. He is a very good councillor."He predicted other Conservatives could join him in leaving the group and said "they are disenchanted, it has lost its way". "We don't know anything that is happening within Cornwall Council - we do not get told."We knew more when we were in opposition than we know now - and that is wrong."
His resignation means the Tories no longer have a majority - although they can rely on non-aligned members to help them win votes.Speaking to BBC Radio Cornwall ahead of his departure, leader Linda Taylor said: "I think it would be naive for anybody to think a political group can get from the start of their administration to the end with all members intact. "I have got the full support of the group behind me. We have got nine months to continue on our journey on making a difference to Cornwall."She also rejected criticism the council was not transparent enough."I am always accountable, but there are times when we have to have discussions that are highly confidential," she added. All Cornwall councillors will face re-election in May 2025.
