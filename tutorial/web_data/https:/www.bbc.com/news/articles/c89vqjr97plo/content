Wildlife experts have urged parents to be cautious when their children are playing in woodland or countryside after a toddler suffered a severe reaction.Three-year-old Ettie had been playing in Bridgehead Woods at Hessle when her hand developed swelling and blistering which required medical treatment.Her mum, Hannah, said the incident had been "upsetting" and would make her think more about where her children play.The Yorkshire Wildlife Trust has inspected the woodland and said it was unlikely to have been caused by giant hogweed, but bluebell sap could have been the cause.
Andy Gibson from the Trust told BBC Radio Humberside visitors to wooded areas need to be cautious but insisted "you don't need to come in full PPE"."If you touch a plant and it starts to make your skin tingle, just make sure you wipe it off as quickly as possible," he said. "But playing outside is what being a kid is all about. It's about being outside and enjoying yourself but be aware that things can affect people," Mr Gibson added.
Ettie's family said the incident would make them more cautious but would not put them off visiting the woods in the future.Her mum Hannah said: "We were there for hours building a really good den. Ettie fell and instantly got upset saying she'd hurt her hand but she carried on playing."We noticed her hand had little lumps the next day but then she developed blisters and we took her to the doctors."Despite her injuries, the three-year-old is still managing to play and has adapted to using her other hand to paint and write."It's been really upsetting because her hand has been incredibly sore. It's also scared me. It's made me think about letting the kids run free and what is in your surroundings because I didn't have a clue," said Hannah.Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
