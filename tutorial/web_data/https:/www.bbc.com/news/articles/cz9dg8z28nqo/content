Plans have been annouced to move library services into the empty Debenhams store in Folkestone town centre. The Grade II listed building in Grace Hill which formerly housed the library has been closed for more than a year over safety concerns. Kent County Council (KCC) said it would leave the historic building and move the "full range" of services into the former department store.A public consultation on the proposals opened on Thursday and will run for eight weeks. 
The Grace Hill library closed in December 2022 due to water damage to the building.KCC has previously said the "extensive" repair work needed would cost around £1.8 million. 
A temporary service has been running at the former Shepway Youth Club, offering computer access and the option to reserve books. KCC said it had "explored the options" but it believed the Folca building is the "best long term location". Clair Bell, KCC’s cabinet member for community and regulatory services, said she recognised the "strength of feeling" on the library's future.She said discussions with Folkestone and Hythe District Council (FHDC) have progressed "positively".
She said: "The work that would be required of us to make the Grace Hill building safe again is significant and the funds are unfortunately not available in the current financial climate."FHDC said its "preferred option" is for the Grace Hill building to "remain as a community hub".Councillor Mike Blakemore, FHDC cabinet member for community and collaboration, said discussions are ongoing. He said: "No business case for its future use, even in part, by the county council has been brought forward or any terms agreed.”The consultation is available at any of the libraries in Folkestone and Hythe, or online, until 11 September.
