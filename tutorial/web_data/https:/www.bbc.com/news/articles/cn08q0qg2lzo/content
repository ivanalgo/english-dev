A gold bikini worn by the late Carrie Fisher in Return of the Jedi has been sold for $175,000 (£136,000) at auction. The Star Wars costume is one of the most famous outfits in film history. It includes a bikini top, bikini plates, hip rings, an armlet and bracelet.Fisher, who played Princess Leia in the films, said she thought director George Lucas was "kidding" when he showed her the bikini. 
She told NPR in an interview a month before her death in 2016 that she felt "nearly naked, which is not a style choice for me" adding that it made her "very nervous". The actress also revealed that during filming she had to "sit very straight because I couldn't have lines on my sides, like little creases. No creases were allowed, so I had to sit very, very rigid straight." A miniature Starfighter aircraft that was used in the filming of the first Star Wars film was sold for $1.5m (£1.1m). Heritage Auctions, who ran the sale, say the object is one of only two filming miniatures created for the production. 
A wand used by Daniel Radcliffe in the film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban fetched $52,000, while a hammer prop from a Thor film made $81,000. An outfit worn by Macauley Culkin in the first Home Alone film was sold for $47,500.
