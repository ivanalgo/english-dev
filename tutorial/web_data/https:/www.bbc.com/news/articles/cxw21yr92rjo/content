Three parks in York have been recognised as being among the country's best green spaces.West Bank Park in Acomb, Clarence Gardens on Haxby Road and Glen Gardens in the Heworth area have been recognised by the Green Flag Award scheme.The international quality mark is assessed by independent judges, and is awarded to  spaces that boast the highest possible environmental standards, are well-maintained and have excellent visitor facilities.City of York Council said the green spaces were "incredibly important for our community and environment".
One of the innovations that impressed the judges was in Clarence Gardens, where unused bowling greens have been turned into a wildflower garden to support pollinators and showcase species like cornflowers and daisies, the council said.Any green space that is freely accessible to the public is eligible to enter for a Green Flag Award.The first Green Flags were awarded in 1997 after decades of underfunding left historic city centre parks neglected.A scheme was launched to bring people back into the parks and establish an agreed standard of good management.It is run by environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy under licence from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.
Councillor Jenny Kent, the council's executive member for environment and climate emergency, said: "It's fantastic news that these much-loved parks and green spaces here in York are being recognised amongst the best in the UK.“We know how much they offer residents and visitors by providing spaces to meet, exercise, relax and play."The authority thanked its council team and partners - especially the Friends’ groups - for maintaining the spaces to such a high standard.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.
