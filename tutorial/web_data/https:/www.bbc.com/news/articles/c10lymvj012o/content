Two residents at a care home for adults with disabilities are set to take on a charity bungee jump.Organisers said the event would raise money for local charity Dementia Jersey and Jersey Cheshire Home, with funds being split equally between the two.Jersey Cheshire Home resident Stanley Baudains, aged 75, said the challenge would be a first, adding the "most daring" thing he has ever done was "getting married".A spokesperson for Bungee in the Park said the height of the bungee will be about 135-147ft (40-45m). 
Mr Baudains said he aimed to raise £1,000 for the fundraiser which would take place in September.He said he had been a resident at the home for two years, which he described as the "best" of his recent life. "My motivation to take part now is to overcome my fear of heights and raise money for the home," he said.Organisers said another resident, Irene Hamon, would also be taking part in the event.Ms Hamon aims to raise £1,000, organisers said.Dementia Jersey CEO Claudine Snape said the charity was "delighted" to bring the "epic challenge" to the island."The Bungee in the Park event is not only a thrilling adventure but also a fantastic opportunity to raise much-needed funds and awareness for two well deserving local charities," the CEO said. "Funds raised will allow Dementia Jersey to continue to provide vital support and services to hundreds of islanders living with dementia and their families.”Organisers said the jumps take place on 7 and 8 September in People's Park, St Helier.
