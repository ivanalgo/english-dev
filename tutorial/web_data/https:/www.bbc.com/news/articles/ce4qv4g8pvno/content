Urgent fire safety work to fix "dangerous cladding" at a Surrey secondary school will begin "as soon as possible", according to a council.  Surrey County Council's cabinet is set to approve repair works at Winston Churchill School in Woking to replace panels, but it is not expected to be finished until next spring.Cladding and curtain walls do not prevent fires from spreading through the main building or science block, the council has said. The council says the danger poses “a serious risk” if nothing is done.
Lessons are expected to resume after the summer whilst the repair works are undertaken. To ensure pupils and staff are safe the council said “robust action” had already been taken – including upgrading smoke and fire detection systems.Natalie Bramhall, cabinet member for property, waste and infrastructure, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: “Following a number of surveys a plan has been developed for the upgrade of insulation and fireproofing at the school to bring these up to new industry standards.“In the interim, robust action has already been taken to mitigate any specific risk identified during these surveys, including  liaison with Surrey County Council’s fire officer and upgrading the school’s smoke and fire detection systems."SCC cabinet will discuss the issue on Tuesday. "Once approved works will begin as soon as possible," Ms Bramhall said.
