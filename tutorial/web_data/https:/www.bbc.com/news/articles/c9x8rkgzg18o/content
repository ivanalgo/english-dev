A car manufacturer plans to launch a training facility for those looking to enter the automotive sector.The Sunderland scheme is being led by Nissan which plans to develop the skills of school children, apprentices and those already working in the industry.The £14.6m MADE NE project is expected to receive £9.6m from the North East Combined Authority (NECA) after a council report backed the scheme.Adam Pennick, vice president for manufacturing at Nissan Sunderland, said to "build the cars of the future you need the skills of the future".
MADE NE - which stands for Manufacturing, Automation, Digitalisation, Electrification North East - is planned to be built across two facilities at the International Advance Manufacturing Park (IAMP) in Sunderland.It will focus on training a workforce for electric vehicle and battery manufacturing.
Nissan said the project will aim to be self-sustaining within five years and generate money through the delivery of apprenticeships, sub-letting office space and making Nissan's training commercially available.The car manufacturer has developed the project in partnership with NECA, Sunderland City Council, Education Partnership North East, New College Durham, AESC, Vantec, Newcastle University, the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult, and the North East Automotive Alliance.North East Mayor Kim McGuinness said the site would "unlock a generation of skilled workers"."The investment shows how we can make the North East the home of real opportunity by backing local workers and businesses – so our area has good, well-paid, high-skilled jobs and training on the doorstep," she said.
The plans are set to before the NECA cabinet on 30 July.
