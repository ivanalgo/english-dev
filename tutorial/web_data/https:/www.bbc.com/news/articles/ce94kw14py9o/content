A woman who used to just bake birthday cakes for her three children has been given a top industry award.Holly Miller, from Yeovil was presented with the National Wedding Cake Designer 2024 award after starting her business just eight years ago. "My long suffering husband helps me out a lot but, other than that, it's just me," she said. "He does a lot of the washing up and helps make the fillings and preserves," she said.
"I started baking cakes for my kids' birthdays when they were little, I just fell into it really," Ms Miller said."My first wedding cake I made for a lady who works in our local garage in Yeovil and it's just gone from there, it's just blown up and gone mad."The award was presented at a glamorous awards ceremony in London on the 24  January, attended by the greatest names and creative elite of the wedding industry. The awards pitched Holly against regional finalists in the southwest of the UK first, before those regional winners were put forward to the national finals.
“It's a lovely big acrylic award which I subsequently dropped and then had to glue it back together. But I love it," said Ms Miller."It's sat on my window sill and I take it to wedding showcases with me everywhere.""I was so delighted to win upon first time of entry, it is the most fantastic feeling," she added. "To receive an award based on real nominations and being judged by top industry experts is almost overwhelming, but I am thrilled to bits, and I will always treasure the moment I actually won.”
