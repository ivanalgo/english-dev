A former undertaker has left more than £80,000 to the Great North Air Ambulance Service (GNAAS) in his will. Frank Barker, from Calderbridge in Cumbria, died aged 92 in 2022 and had a "passion" for motorbikes.He appreciated the role GNAAS played in aiding injured motorcyclists, according to relatives.Mr Barker's cousin and executor of his will, Sally Ingall, said: "It's nice to know Frank's contribution will help GNAAS continue to operate."
Ms Ingall recently visited the air service's base in Penrith alongside her son, Bryan Ingall.Mr Barker left £80,872.32 to GNAAS. He ran his own joinery and undertaker business and spent the majority of his life in Calderbridge. He had a home filled with several motorbikes, said Mr Ingall. 
"He built a few classic race bikes, which were used by a number of people, and he used to go to the Manx Grand Prix and TT races in the Isle of Man," said Mr Ingall. "He knew everybody around the area, and I didn’t hear anyone say a bad word about him."Ms Ingall said it would be "wonderful" if the money played a role in saving someone's life one day.
