A man who drugged, kidnapped and raped a woman he met in a bar has been jailed for 18 years. Siyabonga Dunga spiked his victim's drink and then dragged her back to his hotel room in Leeds before attacking her on 21 January 2023. Dunga, 39, was sentenced for the attack at Leeds Crown Court on Thursday and was told he would have to sign the sex offenders register indefinitely. Dunga, of Sweet Street in Leeds, was described as a "dangerous and calculating sexual predator" by police.
The court was told Dunga gave the woman a drink at Back Room Bar, on Call Lane, in the early hours of the morning and she became disorientated and confused shortly afterwards. At the pretence of coming to her aid, he took his victim outside to get some air and sent her friend back into the club, telling her the woman had left her phone inside. He had, however, pocketed the phone himself. While the friend was inside looking for the phone, Dunga took the woman, who could not walk unaided, back to a nearby hotel.CCTV from the hotel showed the woman collapse and become unresponsive while Dunga dragged her back to his room, where he carried out the rape.Investigating officer Det Con Andy Jones, of British Transport Police, said: “Dunga is a dangerous and calculating sexual predator who is thankfully now off the streets.“By her own admission the woman has been left a shell of her former self."He said he commended her "bravery and strength" during the investigation.At a trial earlier this year, Dunga was convicted of rape, kidnap, administering a substance with intent and committing an offence with the intention of committing a sexual offence.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
