A preschool rated 'outstanding' by Ofsted has been saved from the brink of closure after an influx of donations.All Saints Preschool in North Leatherhead held an emergency meeting on 10 June over financial pressures, which it attributed to government funding and the cost of living crisis.Leatherhead Community Hub (LCH), where the school is based, said over the last five weeks the school received contributions from the Community Foundation for Surrey, Surrey County Council, and Leatherhead United Charities, as well as private donations.All Saints Preschool posted on its Facebook page: "We have been overwhelmed by the support from everyone and the ongoing support that we are receiving."
The nursery, which opened in 2012, was rated outstanding by Ofsted in its 2016 inspection and its latest report in 2019. In a petition to Surrey local authorities, the school said it accepted higher than the national average number of children with additional needs and students with child protection plans in place. 
The petition read: "The closure of this institution would leave many families without accessible and affordable options for their young ones' education."We are in a deprived area and support our families in many ways including helping them with food and signposting them to other agencies."Charity community hub LCH said it has also put in place extra trustees to help the school create a future funding plan. Preschool chairwoman Lucy Townsend said: "We have been overwhelmed by the amount of support that we have received, and we are so thankful for all of your help and generosity."
