Controversial plans to introduce a £10m cycle lane to connect two borough areas are progressing, a council confirmed. Wirral Council voted to go ahead with the lane between Birkenhead and New Brighton in 2022 but it is only now moving forward with phase one.The project will see a continuous cycle route run from Hamilton Square to Liscard with changes to 17 roads.It has split opinion with some expressing concern over loss of trees and access but others saying it would "help people who wish to walk and cycle achieve a more active lifestyle". 
A Wirral Council environment committee report said the scheme needed to progress so it could be delivered between 2027 and 2032 or Wirral could face “losing out on a significant funding opportunity.” It also said the plans tie into the wider regeneration and “deliver a sustainable left bank of the Mersey”.The scheme is projected to cost around £10m based on a dated projection but the whole scheme extending to New Brighton would cost £18m, the council said. Funding is expected to be covered by active travel grants awarded to the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority which are earmarked for improvements to help people walk and cycle, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.  Last year, the council asked for public feedback on the plans, as previous consultations of the route had been criticised as “woeful” by Conservative councillors.Responses varied between wards with 75% in support in Birkenhead but 48.9% against in Seacombe and 61.9% against in Liscard.While some objections argued the routes would be little used, the committee report said the more active routes delivered would increase cycling and walking.
