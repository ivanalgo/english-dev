The Labour leader of Stoke-on-Trent City Council has said government measures in the King's Speech align with the authority’s priorities.The speech set out the draft laws the new government plans to introduce in the coming months, including those related to workers’ rights, public transport, housing and planning.Jane Ashworth said she shared the government's desire to grow the economy.Conservative opposition group leader Dan Jellyman said he believed the government’s planning proposals would result in an attack on the green belt.
“This will lead to brownfield sites sitting empty in Stoke-on-Trent, as house builders will chose to build on easier sites in the green belt to increase their profits, to the detriment of our inner cities such as Stoke-on-Trent,” he said.Ms Ashworth said she was under no illusions about the challenges which lay ahead, despite her party now running the local authority and national government.“When I became council leader this time last year, I knew we were facing an uphill climb,” she said.
She added: “I’ve made no secret of the fact that I recognise that Stoke-on-Trent suffers from some significant problems and often loses out to other places when it comes to investment.“I’m confident that these new government priorities, alongside our own strategy, can change that.”Ms Ashworth said the health and well-being of people was her primary aim, and that her administration wanted to see all of Stoke-on-Trent’s residents enjoy a good quality of life.“Securing economic growth, getting Britain building and making our streets safer are just some of the reforms that will help us here in Stoke-on-Trent to make our citizens' lives healthier, wealthier, safer, cleaner, greener, fairer and more skilled,” she said.In May, the city council set out its vision to improve the well-being of residents through a series of commitments that it hopes will tackle inequality and improve living standards.These included measures to help people secure employment, discounted bus fares, removing illegally-dumped waste and investment in council-owned housing.The council said its flagship Goods Yard scheme in Stoke was on-track for completion in spring 2025, and will bring more than 230 jobs and provide 180 new homes.There will also be 300 new homes built at the Etruscan Square site in Hanley, along with 500 new Home Office jobs being created at Smithfield, the council said.
