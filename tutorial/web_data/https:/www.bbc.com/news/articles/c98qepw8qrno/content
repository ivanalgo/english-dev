People visiting Frensham Common in Surrey have been warned to keep out of the pond after a suspected outbreak of blue-green algae.Waverley Borough Council said visitors, including dogs, must not swim in Frensham Great Pond until further notice.A council spokesperson said a ranger spotted "what looks like" a blue-green algae bloom on Wednesday and alerted the Environment Agency. The EA will analyse samples of the water and issue an update on Friday after they have been analysed. 
The Waverley council spokesperson, said: "We are still awaiting confirmation from the EA, however, in the meantime, we are warning visitors not to swim or paddle, or let dogs near the water."We have clear signage up in the vicinity of the beach, our rangers are advising people on site and we are alerting visitors via social media and our website.  "There needs to be two full weeks of clear inspections before further investigation.”Blue-green algae naturally occurs in inland waters, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.It can produce toxins called "harmful algae blooms" that can kill wild animals, farm livestock and pets.It can also cause rashes and illness in humans, if swallowed. Not all blue-green algal blooms and scums are toxic but there is no way to easily tell, the Environment Agency says.Posting on social media, the council, which oversees and manages the pond, said: “Please be aware blue-green algae has been found at Frensham Great Pond, meaning visitors will not be able to swing in the pond at this time.‘Stay tuned for updates as to when the algae has cleared and the pond is open again.”
