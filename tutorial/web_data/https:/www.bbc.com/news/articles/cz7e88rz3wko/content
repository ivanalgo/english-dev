Farmers have fought back against a proposal to switch a council in Devon to plant-based catering and encourage a shift to plant-based farming.The plan was condemned as "idiotic" and "a slap in the face for farmers" at a North Devon Council meeting on Wednesday.Ricky Knight, a Green Party councillor who put forward the motion, said he wanted "to address the problems of climate change".The proposal was heavily defeated with all members voting against except for Mr Knight and his Green Party colleague who seconded the motion.
The motion asked the council to serve fully plant-based food and drink at internal meetings and events and for plant-based options to be prioritised and promoted throughout the district. It also called for the council to work with local farmers to support a move towards production of plant-based produce.Mark Weekes, a Devon sheep farmer, said the proposal was "ridiculous".He said: "Here in north Devon it's absolutely idiotic to think we could have a completely plant-based council."Our great farmers work incredibly hard to produce sustainable and well-priced healthy food. Meat, above all else, is one of the highest, densest sources of protein that you can eat."David Chugg, a north Devon farmer and Devon NFU deputy chairman, said: "I think it's very disappointing it's got to this stage. "Everyone should make their own decision on what they want to eat or not eat."
Robin Milton is the Independent councillor for Bishops Nympton ward but was not allowed to vote on the proposal due to his position as a livestock farmer.He said: "North Devon is a very rural area that is based around livestock farming predominantly and the potential to go for entirely plant-based production is virtually impossible here."The environmental impacts would be huge, the jobs impacts would be huge and the impacts on the landscape, our tourism, everything that's great about north Devon would be challenged."During the meeting, David Worden, Liberal Democrat member for South Molton, said the proposal was "a slap in the face for farmers".Liz Bulled, Conservative member for North Molton, said livestock farming was "the bedrock of north Devon" and said people needed "freedom of choice to eat what we want to eat".
Local authorities like Exeter had already moved to providing plant-based food at meetings and events.Michaela Andrews from the Plant-Based Councils campaign group is trying to get more councils to switch to vegan catering.She wanted councils to "lead by example" and "show this is a clear solution to the climate crisis".Ms Andrews said eight councils in England had switched to plant-based catering and said this had sent "a powerful message to the world that this is the way we need to be heading as a  society".Mr Knight said he hoped the proposal would help North Devon Council "to continue its conversation" with farmers in the area.
