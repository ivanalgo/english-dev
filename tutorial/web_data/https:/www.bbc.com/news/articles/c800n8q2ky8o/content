Extra workers at Birmingham Airport have been brought in to "explain cabin baggage liquid rules to passengers" who are continuing to face long queues to get through security.The short-term move follows continuing criticism over lengthy hold-ups that have caused some people to miss flights.An enlarged temporary structure with a number of so-called "liquid check stations" has now opened, the airport said."The more we can do together to reduce the number of bags that don't comply with these rules, the more we can reduce queues at security screening," added chief executive Nick Barton.
Mr Barton previously spoke of his disappointment that restrictions on carrying liquids of more than 100ml in hand luggage, which had been eased, were temporarily reintroduced by the UK government. The airport has spent £60m on new scanners in the expectation rules on liquids would be relaxed. Described as next generation security checkpoints, they will scan luggage bags that contain bottles of liquid of up to two litres.Mr Barton said the extra "third-party customer service specialists" would in the meantime explain current rules and help passengers "prepare for security"."These new measures are designed to give passengers a smoother and easier experience though security," he added.The airport boss has previously claimed about one in six passengers going through Birmingham are not following procedures on liquid limits.
Many travellers at Birmingham have criticised the airport after weeks of disruption.The 100ml liquid rules are in place at all UK airports. Reports of long passenger delays in Birmingham are more frequent than at other airports.In May, the BBC was told Birmingham needed at least 100 more security agents, with the number of vacant positions meaning security staff felt overstretched, making it harder to recruit and retain staff.Building work has been under way for more than a year to create a new "simpler and streamlined" security search area.Escalators are closed due to the works, meaning travellers have to queue to get lifts up to the security area.
Andrew and Jill Saunders called the situation a "complete fiasco" and told the BBC Mr Barton was "missing the point" by "blaming everyone apart from the airport"."The major issue is the restricted access to the first floor," they said."Passengers are herded into lines which eventually feed into four lifts which just cannot cope with the volume. "The escalators and staircases have gone, as has the separate Jet2 access at the top end of the terminal."They also said: "There are ceilings down all over the place, wiring hanging down and passengers directed down narrow dimly-lit corridors. "I estimate that we walked at least half a mile on the way to the new security hall - where there are fewer facilities."The building works are nowhere near completed."Bradley Stone told the BBC management of queues at the airport was "woeful"."So many people, me included, will simply not use BHX in future," he said."Currently it’s simply the worst airport in the UK."
