Councillors are being urged to restore a ferry service crossing the Thames Estuary for foot passengers.The service between Gravesend in Kent and Tilbury in Essex, was halted earlier this year after an agreement to extend the current contract could not be made.According to Local Democracy Reporting Service, Thurrock Council in Essex and Kent County Council are now said to be working together to try to find a long-term future for the service.At a full Thurrock Council meeting, Independent member Roy Jones put forward a motion urging a concerted effort to find long-term funding for the ferry.
"Many members in this chamber and residents in the public gallery and in Thurrock have probably used the Thames crossing at some point in their lives," said Mr Jones, who represents Stanford East & Corringham Town ward."I have fond memories of paying many a visit to Gravesend with my family. My children used to enjoy the ferry crossing immensely."It was far simpler to use a five-minute trip to cross from one landing stage to another one than sit in traffic on the A13."John Kent, Labour leader of Thurrock, said he was "absolutely committed" to bringing back the ferry.He said: “We recognise the important role that passenger transport on the river is likely to play and we want to do all we can to make sure the Tilbury Ferry can be part of that future.”
