A retired lorry driver who discovered a 1st Century BC bronze Celtic "fertility figure" with oversized genitals has put it up for auction.Bob Jemmett, 75, was taking part in an organised metal detecting rally at Great Chishill, Cambridgeshire, in 2018 when he received "a lovely signal" from his detector.He dug down 4in (10cm) to reveal the ancient figure and, after reporting it the Portable Antiquities scheme,  it has been his "constant companion" on rallies since. Mr Jemmett decided to sell the figure, nicknamed "Nobby" through Noonans Mayfair on 20 June to fund improvements at his home near Manningtree, Essex.
It is estimated to fetch up to £1,500 at the auction.Mr Jemmett said the 2018 rally took place in appalling weather "with the rain lashing down"."The figure was identified as a Celtic fertility figure and [was] subsequently used as a logo by the rally organisers in their promotions," he said. "As a result, detectorists from all over Europe at rallies would ask me if they could see "Nobby", who I always keep in my pocket as a constant companion!”It is similar to the Cerne Abbas Giant carved into a hill in Dorset, which is now believed to date to the Anglo-Saxon period. 
Nigel Mills, Noonans' artefact and coin expert at Noonans, said: “This unique figure dates from the 1st Century BC, he has an oversized bald head with deep sockets for eyes, wedges for arms and short legs."He has previously said such figures might "have had symbolic powers of good luck and warding off evil spirits".Mr Jemmett, who is married with two daughters and eight grandchildren, has been metal-detecting for 30 years.
