"You're taking care of something, you have a purpose at the end of the day."21-year-old Thomas works on perhaps the most unusual farm in Northern Ireland.The farm is within the high walls of Hydebank Wood Young Offenders' Centre in Belfast.It is home to 25 sheep, about 40,000 bees, a rescue pony, two goats and a flock of chickens.Thomas has served two years of a four-year and eight-month sentence for wounding.He admitted that he never thought he would be doing farm work, but said he is "really proud"."I've got a good opportunity that not many boys get in here, because I've kept my head down and was determined to change, to rehabilitate myself," he explained.Most recently, he has been bottle feeding some of the lambs bred within the prison."You want to help them and try to get them big and strong," he continued.The Blue Leicester sheep and the other animals in Hydebank are all reared and cared for by young offenders like Thomas.
The idea for a farm within the site came from one of the prison officers, Richard Graham.Almost a decade ago, Mr Graham was given responsibility for tending the landscape, cutting the grass, and growing flowers in Hydebank.Then he thought of rearing sheep as an alternative way to keep the grass short."I was born on a farm, and I know what farming can bring to you as a person," Mr Graham told BBC News NI.The sheep, pony, bees, and goats are all looked after by prisoners, supervised by Mr Graham."The first task in the morning is they go out, they feed, they water, but more than that, they also check the health," he said."They come back and report to me if there's any problems, any issues, any sore feet, and I will then go round and they will tend to that under my supervision."Before they go back to their rooms at night, the prisoners also check on the animals again."We try and teach them something that'll be a life skill for them," Mr Graham said."We want to be able to send these young lads out, that they can go out and they can contribute to society on the outside in a good way."Mr Graham added that 80â€“90% of the young offenders involved in the project have never worked with animals before."It's life-changing; what you put in is what you will take back out; I steer the ship; it's the young men in here who make this happen," he added.
According to Hydebank's governor, Richard Taylor, the "ultimate goal" of the farm is to reduce re-offending."Many of our young men and women come from inner city areas and have never been involved with animals before."He added that farming is a 24/7 job, and there is a waiting list of people who want to be involved in the project.The sheep reared within Hydebank have attracted attention outside the prison walls, winning awards at the Balmoral Show.Thomas said he hopes to find work on a farm when he is released.Reflecting on his role, he added he is proud of the part he has played, particularly during lambing season."You're bringing something into this world."
