There are calls for more safety measures in a road in Surrey which has been the site of two serious crashes.Maybury Hill in Woking was the scene of a suspected hit-and-run in which a pedestrian died and in a separate incident a motorcyclist was seriously injured in a crash involving a car.The incidents happened within a week of each other on 8 and 15 July.Surrey County Council said discussions would be held in due course on improvements that could be made to the road.
Woking councillors Ellen Nicholson and Peter Graves told BBC Radio Surrey that changes were needed to the road.Ms Nicholson said the road was one of the main routes in to Woking, and that the councillors wanted traffic to be "flowing freely", with the road also safe for pedestrians and drivers.She said: "Every life lost is a tragedy and it shocked the local residents, but they weren't surprised."Mr Graves said he thought the six pedestrian crossings within about 400 metres (1,300ft) on the road was part of the problem, and that synchronising them might help.He added: "I think we've probably got to do something about the speed, it may mean trying to reduce it down to 20mph."
A council spokesperson said they "very much sympathised" with those affected by the crashes."Surrey County Council road safety engineers will discuss these with Surrey Police in due course with a view to considering what highway improvements might be possible to reduce the risk of future collisions," they added.
