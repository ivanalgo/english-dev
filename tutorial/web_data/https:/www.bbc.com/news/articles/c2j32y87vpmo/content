Work on what has been called the “missing link” on a Yorkshire canal towpath is to be carried out after funding for resurfacing and improvements was secured.The work on the two-mile stretch of path on the Leeds-Liverpool Canal between Kildwick in North Yorkshire and Silsden in West Yorkshire is expected to cost about £1.8m.Proposals for improvements on the towpath include better access for people with mobility difficulties and pushchairs, as well as the addition of new signs and widening of the path itself.Mark Robinson, from the Canal and River Trust, said: "We’re delighted that funding has been secured."
The project is a partnership between Bradford Council, North Yorkshire Council and the West Yorkshire Combined Authority.A drop-in event seeking people's views on the improvements is due to be held at Silsden Town Hall on 31 July and an online survey is open until 21 August.Mr Robinson said: “This towpath upgrade project is a fantastic example of how we can work together to make canals more welcoming and attractive, not only to local people but also visiting boaters, who bring important economic benefits to the local communities.“We strongly encourage people to take a look at these proposals and have their say on how they can be improved.”Work on the project was expected to start in the winter and be completed in spring 2025, the trust said.
