Woodland in the Silkstone area is being searched following information that she enjoys spending time outdoors.Police are considering that she may not want to be found or realise that she is classed as missing, or that she may have come to harm.
"That may be either she's had a medical episode, she might have fallen. I've really got to stress there's no suggestion there's third-party involvement," Mr Mallows said."We're just keen to make contact with her as soon as possible to make sure she's safe and well."Claire was last seen wearing a knee-length blue gilet with a mint green top underneath and grey jeans.Anybody who has seen her or may have information as to her whereabouts is asked to get in touch with South Yorkshire Police.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
