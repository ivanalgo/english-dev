It could take more than a year for a petrol leak in a Surrey village to be cleared up as fuel is slowly pulled from the ground, residents have been told.A warning to more than 600 households in Bramley not to drink their tap water was lifted on July 3 after more than a month in place.Thames Water issued the “do not drink” notice after a historic fuel leak from an Asda petrol station in the village.A public meeting on Tuesday was attended by Asda chairman Lord Stuart Rose, the Environment Agency, and Jeremy Hunt MP.
Helen Melia, from the Bramley Residents' Action Group, said residents were told the clean-up would "not be a quick thing".She told BBC Radio Surrey: "It's obviously a very serious concern for the village. People turned up, listened to what was said and asked questions."Mr Hunt posted on X, formerly Twitter, that the environment agency had "made clear the clean-up is anticipated to take a year at least as the fuel must be pulled slowly out from the ground to avoid further issues".He said an offer of compensation from Asda was "much needed right now for struggling businesses".
Mr Hunt said Lord Rose would be returning in September to update residents on four key actions identified during the meeting.These were a commitment to improve communications, a discussion with Asda's board on compensation for businesses, and Openreach restoring the network to those affected.The fourth point was around advice for residents on the risk of long-term exposure at low levels to benzene and other hydrocarbons.Asda, which owns the petrol station, previously said it inherited the issue when it bought the site.
