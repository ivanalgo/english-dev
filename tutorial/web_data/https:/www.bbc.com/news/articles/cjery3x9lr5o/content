A Surrey man who hoped to kayak around Britain in the quickest time ever said his world record attempt is “well and truly dead”.Mike Lambert, 33, began his 1,881-mile (3,028km) challenge from East Wittering, in West Sussex, on 1 June.But plagued by abysmal weather and fierce currents, Mr Lambert, from Walton-on-Thames, has admitted that beating the current record of 40 days is now impossible.“I didn’t really consider the conditions here when planning,” Mike told the BBC during his ninth day stuck in Thurso, Scotland, on Friday.
The physiotherapist needed to cover an average of 51 miles a day to finish the trip in 39 days.But he has been forced to stay on land for a roughly two weeks due to adverse weather.
“I’ve been really lucky, though,” said Mr Lambert. “Someone emailed me through my website and offered me their holiday home here in Thurso, so I’ve been staying there, else I’d be in my tent on the beach.“I celebrated my birthday here on 30 June. The lifeguards in Thurso had a live music night so I went along to that. I feel like I know half the town.“It’s been great but the record attempt is well and truly dead.”
But Mr Lambert is not giving in entirely - instead he has given himself a new challenge.He said: “I’m hoping to get going again soon and want to be averaging 100 kilometres a day.“If I can get back to Sussex by 20 July then I’ll be very happy.”As well as wanting to clock up the miles, the kayaker said he hopes to see more wildlife on along the way.“There are two pods of killer whales which often come close to the shore to feed, so I’m really hoping to see them,” he said.
