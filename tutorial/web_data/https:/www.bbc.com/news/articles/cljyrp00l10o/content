Plans to build a supermarket on an "eyesore" site have been met with mixed reactions.Lidl said it would hold a public consultation into proposals to build on the derelict site of Middlesbrough's former Marton Hotel and Country Club.The hotel, which closed in 2017, was destroyed in a fire in 2019 and demolished.Many residents have welcomed plans for "something useful" at the site, while others are concerned a supermarket could "exacerbate traffic congestion" on Marton Road.
Middlesbrough-based company OJA Enterprises bought the site in 2017 and it was used to train fire crews.It was added to Middlesbrough Council's list of "eyesore" landmarks in need of regeneration in 2020.The land was purchased by Lidl in 2022, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
In a letter to councillors, Lidl said highways surveys had been undertaken  "in order to prepare a robust transport assessment" to support its planning application.Marton East independent councillors Dorothy Davison and Jason McConnell said there had been mixed responses to the plans. One resident said: "Traffic is already horrendous and the condition of the road is a sham, do we really need another supermarket? Another added: "The site has been left vacant since the fire and has became somewhat of an eyesore filling the land with something useful would benefit the local economy and community."
The German chain had previously hoped to build a supermarket in Linthorpe but the plan was rejected in November.Councillors unanimously turned down its proposal over concerns about road safety, layout and visual impact.The refusal came after Lidl was criticised by campaigners for chopping down a number of trees on the site.
