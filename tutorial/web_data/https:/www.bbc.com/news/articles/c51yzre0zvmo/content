Taxi drivers say proposed new licensing rules could take hundreds of vehicles off the road.Cumberland Council is consulting drivers on its new policy which would mean vehicles more than ten years old would not be able to be used as a taxi.If approved, it would also make drivers adhere to a strict dress code and introduce a penalty points system for anyone caught breaking rules.Drivers have started a petition against the proposals, but the council is asking drivers to respond directly through its consultation.
Tanisha Dobinson, the owner of taxi firm Stainburn Travel in Workington, said: "A lot of these changes would completely knock us out of business. "A lot of our vehicles are already nearly ten years old and are passing the tests at the council and we can't understand why they should have to come off the road."She believes that vehicles which pass council tests should be fine to operate. She said: "We had a count up and we would lose over 200 taxis."
Cumberland Council said: "The proposed policy surrounding the age of vehicles across Cumberlandâ€™s taxi and private hire fleet is to ensure that all vehicles are safe and accessible for Cumberland residents. "It is also to ensure that cars are as efficient and environmentally friendly as possible."It says the proposed taxi licensing policy aims to harmonise three pre-existing sets of rules from former, now defunct district councils. Responses to the consultation will be reviewed by the council's regulatory committee.
