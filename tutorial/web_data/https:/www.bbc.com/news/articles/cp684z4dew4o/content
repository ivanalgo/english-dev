A public consultation is under way on a popular paddling pool in Hull, which has remained closed for a second summer.Hull City Council shut the facility in Pickering Park last year "due to health and safety concerns".It said the site was "in need of refurbishment" because of its age and "some underlying issues with the drainage and surface condition".The consultation runs until 26 August and sets out a number of options including whether to improve the pool or develop a new facility.
Among the ideas are plans for a a water play area or splash pad similar to that installed at Bude Park, which is due to open this summer.
Posting on social media, MP for Kingston upon Hull West and Haltemprice Emma Hardy urged pool users to take part in the consultation.She said: "The pool is a fantastic free resource and is enjoyed by lots of local families, including my own."The council said the paddling pool was "a much-loved feature of Pickering Park" and hoped to reopen it "ready for the summer of 2025".
