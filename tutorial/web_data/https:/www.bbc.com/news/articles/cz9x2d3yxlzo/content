A man who says he felt trapped in an "excessive" mortgage after Northern Rock's collapse is taking his fight to the High Court.David Riley, 76, from Yeovil in Somerset, sold his home at financial loss after being unable to keep up with mortgage repayments when his contract was taken over by  TSB Whistletree."It's been a struggle. It was like being in a prison," Mr Riley said.TSB said it is "committed to treating Whistletree customers fairly" and does not believe the claim has "merit".
Mr Riley is one of 2,500 former customers fighting for compensation against TSB Whistletree. Their mortgages were sold to the bank after the 2007 collapse, when some claim they were "stuck" with rates 10% higher. "I wasn't aware that TSB had taken ownership of my mortgage and that it was now called Whistletree."I was unaware people were in a similar situation. Now there's a big group of us I think it's going to be more positive," Mr Riley told Radio Somerset.Harcus Parker Solicitors is representing some of the claimants. A spokesperson said the claimants paid more than 2% above the bank's standard mortgage rate.
TSB bosses say they offered people the opportunity to switch to different deals, however, Whistletree customers have claimed that a lot of people were rejected because the criteria to afford mortgages had changed.Solicitor at Harcus Parker Matthew Patching said: "It's really powerful and compelling."There are people who were keeping up with very high mortgage payments for a very long time."
TSB confirmed since the takeover, two-thirds of Whistletree customers have either moved to a new mortgage or closed their mortgage.A spokesperson for TSB said: "This is a hearing for the court to determine some specific issues that have been raised as part of Harcus Parkerâ€™s legal action relating to Whistletree mortgage terms and conditions, in advance of any final trial."
