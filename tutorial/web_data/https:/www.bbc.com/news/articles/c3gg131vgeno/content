Six months before the start of Bradford's potentially transformative year as the UK's City of Culture, work on transport infrastructure in the city centre is continuing.Some frustrated bus passengers told the BBC they fear the current disruption risks the city taking a backwards step.Work to pedestrianise parts of the city centre has also created long delays.A decision on the future of the Interchange bus station has been delayed until at least September pending the results of safety surveys, the West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA) said in an update on Friday.
Michael Underwood is reliant on bus transport. Despite the warm weather, the 79-year-old was already thinking about the impact of the Interchange's closure in the months ahead."What's going to happen when winter comes?," he asked."It's chaos, utter chaos," added Mr Underwood, who was waiting for a bus to take him home to Holme Wood."There are no timetables, there is no indication if the bus has gone or how long you have got to wait for the next bus. The service is terrible."What does he think of the disruption with Bradford 2025 fast approaching?"City of Culture, it's a joke."There is no City of Culture. Just look around and see what's happened to Bradford city centre."It's like The Crystal Maze, there's fences and barriers up and you don't know where you are going."
Pensioner Angela Curtis is also a regular bus user. She was making the most of Sunday's warm temperatures by catching the bus to Baildon to meet a friend for a walk when she spoke to the BBC.Communication about the closure had been "hopeless", she said, while also expressing her fears for the city's reputation."I can't think of another town or city that doesn't have a bus station. We need one."The WYCA said it was considering alternative sites for a temporary bus terminus if the Interchange cannot be used for Bradford's City of Culture year.Asked what would-be visitors might think, Ms Curtis, who lives in Great Horton, said: "I think they will swear never to come back."
Mark Greenoff has to catch two buses to get to work at Leeds Bradford Airport. He said the Interchange's closure meant he was no longer able to make the last bus home, with a temporary stop located too far away."People are just getting rather annoyed at the fact West Yorkshire Combined Authority seem to be dragging their heels," he said.In a statement also released on Friday, Bradford Council leader Susan Hinchcliffe said it was "in everyone’s interests to get the findings of the surveys the Combined Authority has commissioned as quickly as possible. "We need clear answers on the future of the building."In the latest update, WYCA mayor Tracy Brabin said she and others "are working flat out to come to the right decision on the future of the Interchange, bearing in mind the critical importance of public safety"."There's diversions here, there and everywhere and nobody knows where they are going," said Mr Greenoff, who was waiting for the bus to work when he spoke to the BBC."I would like a decision to be made sooner, rather than later - rather than while the end of the year because it's the City of Culture for 2025."I don't think this work will be done by 2025."Ms Brabin said residents and businesses "have my word that we will continue to invest in Bradford to make a great success of this magnificent city as its 2025 UK City of Culture year approaches”.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
