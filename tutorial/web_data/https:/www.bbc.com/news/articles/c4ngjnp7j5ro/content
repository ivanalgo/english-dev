A man who had been drinking heavily was found walking across the Lincolnshire Fens at night with a young child who then got hypothermia.Samuel Price, 40, ran out of petrol in the village of Little Steeping, near Spilsby, and set out across the countryside in temperatures of 7.5C (45.4F).The child was wearing only a romper suit when the pair were found by police at 02:00 BST on 26 May. Price previously admitted a count of neglect and Lincoln Crown Court heard in mitigation that he accepted his behaviour that night had been "abominable". 
The court heard Price was staying in a mobile home in the area and had gone for a drive with the child after drinking heavily.Stuart Lody, prosecuting, said police were alerted and used a drone to locate Price.He said officers had recorded the night-time temperature and the child was found to be hypothermic when checked over in hospital."Thankfully a full recovery was made," Mr Lody told the court.
Passing sentence, Recorder Paul Mann KC told Price his neglect was aggravated by the fact he had been drinking and he would have probably faced a jail sentence if he had not pleaded guilty."You were found in a field. By that time the child was beginning to suffer from hypothermia," he said."The child was wearing only a romper suit which was not suitable enough for the temperature of seven degrees, although, to be fair to you, you had also wrapped the child in your own coat."Price, who had already spent 38 days in custody, was sentenced to a 15-month community order.He must also complete a 40-day rehabilitation activity requirement and abstain from alcohol for 120 days.
