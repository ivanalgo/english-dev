People in Skegness have been asked to create poppies for a big display around the town's landmark clock tower as part of this year’s remembrance events.The Royal British Legion has asked for thousands of poppies, either knitted, crocheted or any other waterproof craft, to be donated so they can be used to cover the large grass area at the bottom of the tower.A collection box for completed poppies has been placed in the Hildreds shopping centre in the town.The display was expected to be set out in the second week of October and the poppies would be on display for a month, the charity said.
The veterans' charity said it had so far already received at least 1,000 donations, but thousands more were needed.Tracy Turner, from Skegness Royal British Legion, explained that the poppies would cover the ground at the base of the tower, rather than cascading down it, as it was Grade II-listed.Ms Turner said: "We want the community to come together, knit, crochet, make bottles, laminate - any kind of medium we can get poppies to use in our display for later in the year. "It’s going to be spectacular and is going to be a mass beacon for remembrance to remember our fallen.”Ms Turner said she felt “humbled”  by the way the community had come together so far to donate.  "I’ve had people from London sending poppies. I’ve got 93 and 98 year olds knitting poppies. But we need thousands and thousands as it’s a really big area to cover.”
Paul Dixon, a veteran and chairman of  Skegness Royal British Legion, said community involvement was really important “so they know it’s all year round, not just one day giving your money for your poppy"."It’s not just that one Remembrance Day, it’s about supporting our beneficiaries," he added.Mr Dixon, who served in the Gulf War and toured in Bosnia, and due to his injuries  uses a wheelchair, said he had received support from the charity himself.“The British Legion has helped with aids for round the flat I live in: grab rails and a stair lift to get up the stairs.  "It’s so important that the support is there. Without it, I would be sat at home stuck in a chair, not able to do anything.”Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
