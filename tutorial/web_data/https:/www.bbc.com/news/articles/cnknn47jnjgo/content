Plans to build 60 homes on green space next to a motorway have been thrown out over fears of toxic pollutants linked to cancer.Sandwell Council’s planning committee rejected the application to build flats and homes on a wildlife corridor off Titford Road in Oldbury, near the M5.The authority’s environmental health department had raised concerns about the fumes from the nearby busy roads affecting people who would move into the new estate.The fine pollution particles of concern, known as particulate matter or PM2.5, have been linked to cancer, heart disease, asthma and low birth weight.
Despite the concerns, the plans had been recommended for approval by the council’s planning department, but the committee rejected them during a meeting on Wednesday.Councillor Liam Preece said: “I am deeply uncomfortable with asking people to move into a place that is toxic or unsafe and will likely remain that way in the future.”Titford Road resident Phil Shakespeare has led the campaign against building on the land for a number of years.Speaking at the meeting, he said the homes would cause “complete and irreversible destruction” of the green space, which he said acted as a filter from noise and pollution for residents.
There were also concerns raised over the proposed access that would have been built from Titford Road.Councillor Bill Gavan said: “The traffic is a nightmare and the air quality, I believe, is disgusting.”A report published by planning officers ahead of the meeting said the development would “deliver a much needed mix of affordable housing”.The refusal came despite Sandwell Council including the land as a potential new housing site in its draft local plan.
