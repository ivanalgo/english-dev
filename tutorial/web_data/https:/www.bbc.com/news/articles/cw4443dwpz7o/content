Work is under way to improve the roads of a town centre ring road as part of a £750,000 investment.The scheme, which centres around Queensgate and Shorehead roundabout in Huddersfield, starts on Monday and could take up to two months to complete.To allow the works to go ahead safely and efficiently, a number of road closures and diversions would be in place, Kirklees Council said.The road improvements are taking place ahead of the council's "Cultural Heart" regeneration project.
Kirklees Council said the improvement works would include resurfacing the carriageway and roundabout, laying new kerbing, improving the central reservation, and upgrading traffic signals and pedestrian crossings.Full road closures will be limited from Mondays to Thursdays, 08:00 until midnight, and from 16:30 until midnight on Sundays.Work will not be carried out on Friday or Saturday in support of the local leisure industry, the council said, and any noisy operational work should be completed by midnight.David Shepherd, strategic director for growth and regeneration said: "The Huddersfield Ring Road is a vital gateway into Huddersfield town centre and by investing in these works, we are creating better access to town centre shops, cafes, restaurants, bars, and local businesses. "The difference will be significant, and I would like to thank people in advance for their patience while these important works are carried out.”Throughout the works, traffic management will vary with diversion routes in place to support the work phases.
