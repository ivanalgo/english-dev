One million trees have been planted as part of an initiative run by Cornwall Council.The community planting programme, dubbed the Forest for Cornwall, began in 2019 and involves businesses, farmers, community groups and schools across the county.The council said the "forest" - which includes woodland, hedgerows as well as individual trees - now covers a total of about 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres).It said the aim was to see more planting across 1,500 hectares (3707 acres) by spring next year.
The authority said the aim of the scheme was to increase nature for residents and absorb carbon emissions. Councillor Martyn Alvey, the cabinet member for environment and climate change, said: "We want to say thanks a million to everyone who has helped plant and look after the million trees we've established for the Forest for Cornwall, which is enriching both our countryside and our communities. â€œOur next target is 1,500 hectares by next spring as more farms are undertaking large-scale planting of trees, shrubs and hedges."As part of the scheme, the council said 11,000 trees had been planted on Bodmin Beacon, 500 trees at Prislow Fields in Falmouth, 400 trees at Bude Stratton School and 1.3 hectares (3.2 acres) of fruit and nut orchards at Cotehele.
