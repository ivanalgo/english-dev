A Welsh artist has unveiled a new series of pieces including a depiction of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as historical royals. Dan Llywelyn Hall has produced 10 new portraits inspired by royalty throughout history for the Society of Antiquaries as part of an new exhibition in London. Prince Harry is depicted as Charles Edward Stuart, known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, while Meghan is portrayed as Dame Elizabeth Grey, Queen of England by marriage. Mr Llywelyn Hall said he sees the "subject of royalty utterly irresistible and rich succour for art".
He added: "In Harry's case, I have entered the story before he met Meghan - the young party-goer with his future very much in the balance, a bit like the Bonnie Prince I have likened him to."I thought putting Meghan in the role of the White Queen, who was a Queen Consort and possibly the most influential 'outsider' in royal history, might have a fine irony to it and not necessarily beyond the realms of reality."The exhibition, titled The Reign, marks 150 years of the society at Burlington House in London. The pieces will be auctioned to support the cataloguing and digitisation of about 25,000 prints and drawings from the 18th and 19th centuries.Speaking to Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Llywelyn Hall spoke of his inspiration for each of the pieces. "It seemed that these figures caught on the knife edge of public opinion were ideal for drawing comparisons from distant monarchs - like the exiled princes and princesses of the past, that lurk in the background but are still irrevocably tied to the job."The Reign opens to the public at Burlington House on 28 June with an auction on 4 July.
