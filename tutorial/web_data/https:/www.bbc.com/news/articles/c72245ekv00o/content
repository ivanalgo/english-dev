A research project to see if technology can boost the wellbeing of older people has been launched in East Sussex.The Living Lab aims to look at whether using digital technology can help improve the mental and physical health of elderly adults.The results of the 12-month trial project will help shape East Sussex County Council’s adult social care services and local public health commissioning decisions.The project was launched at a sheltered housing facility in Peacehaven following the installation of an interactive digital games table.
Through interactive light projections, residents can experience physical, social and cognitive activities at the ‘Magic Table’, such as solving puzzles, playing games and tactile challenges.The project also includes virtual reality headsets which offer residents virtual day trips and experiences.Mark Stainton, adult social care and health director at the council, said he hoped residents enjoyed the “innovative” project.“The feedback gathered from the pilot scheme will enable us and our partners at the University of Brighton and NHS Sussex to learn how internet-connected devices could help improve the health of older people living locally, as well as see first-hand the positive impact this technology can have on their quality of life,” he said.In addition, clients can opt to have heat sensor fall monitors installed in their apartments or try a sport Smartwatch to monitor their health.It is hoped the technology will also help ease the pressure felt by carers by providing talking points and encouraging interaction between clients and carers, the council said.The pilot project is being delivered in partnership with the council, NHS Sussex and the University of Brighton.Dr Theo Fotis, lead researcher at the university’s School of Sport and Health Sciences, said: "The Living Lab concept allows us to work with all the relevant stakeholders to co-create and conduct the testing of these technologies in a real-world setting, gathering valuable insights from the residents themselves."
