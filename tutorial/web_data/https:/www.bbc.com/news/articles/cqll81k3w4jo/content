A sheepadoodle is helping save lives after becoming the mascot of a defibrillator donation project.The team at Donate for Defib Weston-super-Mare, who are fronted by three-year-old dog, Maya, are installing defibrillators at key locations and have already raised £32,000 for the cause.They have managed to install 35 defibrillators across the town, which have been used about 15 times so far.Josh Bell, one of the project's managers, said Maya had made the project "go bonkers". 
Mr Bell started the project with Tom Farrand after a man had a cardiac arrest in a local pub.Mr Farrand said: “It all started when a person in a pub had a cardiac arrest and the closest defib, was nowhere nearby.“There was one in the Tesco’s but that wasn’t publicly accessible.“So, the patient sadly died at that time.”Mr Bell also had cardiac surgery as a child which inspired him to "make a difference to people's lives". The team said Maya plays a key role in attracting interest to their cause.“There’s now an artist that’s going to do Christmas cards with her on it, there is a local author who wants to write a book on her.“She’s been in endless videos, she’s been in fire trucks, she’s been on lifeboats, she’s been in the coastguard.“She’s been absolutely everywhere,” Mr Bell said. 
They said Maya's involvement encourages families to spend longer learning about the cause. Mr Farrand said: “Kids love dogs, and they’re going to drag their parents over to us.“Then they can both learn how to do CPR or just awareness as well of defibrillators in the town.”A “proud supporter” as Mr Bell recalled, has also made a 3D AI image of Maya named: Maya to the Rescue.Maya has also been turned into keyrings and models by artists.Mr Farrand said: “It just kind of blows my mind that if you put people together, they can show the kindness of humanity instead of how rubbish it can be.”
