Even the choice of venue screams the change in Welsh Labour's approach. Four months ago, Welsh Labour introduced Vaughan Gething as leader in the gleaming surroundings of one of Cardiff University's science centres.Today, the setting was an understated wood-panelled cabin next to the Iron Age hill fort in the Caerau-Ely area of Cardiff. From "look at this everyone!"... to "look at this, but let's get it done and move on".That isn't to say that today's venue wasn't carefully chosen - Ely is Eluned Morgan's home turf.
And today also makes its own history as she becomes the first female leader of Welsh Labour, and will soon be the first female first minister.Despite this historic moment, Welsh Labour has endured a horrible six months, aside from the general election result, with the party tearing itself apart.But, there is optimism amongst Labour MSs that the "unity ticket" of Ms Morgan and current rural affairs secretary Huw Irranca Davies as deputy first minister will indeed unite the party.They also recognise that things could not carry on as they did.Once confirmed as first minister, Ms Morgan will inherit her predecessor's challenges, along with some additional ones, but there is one ray of sunshine. 
Firstly, there is not a lot of money to go round for public services.Ms Morgan's government will face the familiar problem of how to keep the NHS ticking, trains running and fund everything else - including schools, local government and social care.She must also cultivate relationships with other parties and politicians in the Senedd to secure budget approvals, as Labour holds 30 of the 60 seats.What about those extra issues?It is not a great inheritance.Voters now appear to be making a clear distinction between Senedd and Westminster politics, and Labour is faring badly in polling for the 2026 Senedd election.The Gething era has hit them hard.What Ms Morgan does with those public services could be the key to winning voters back.She'll also need to let us know what she stands for, as the lack of contest means a lack of manifesto.Moreover, she must convincingly pitch to Welsh voters that having two Labour governments - one in Wales and one in Westminster - working together, benefits Wales.That's the ray of sunshine.The promising aspect of her tenure is the relationship with Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, a luxury Vaughan Gething enjoyed briefly, Mark Drakeford never had, and Carwyn Jones had for only five months.Voters wait and voters expect.She won without a contest.But Eluned Morgan's fight for 2026 has only just begun.
