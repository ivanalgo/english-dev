A new coin is set to be released to mark 80 years since the D-Day landings during World War Two.The 50p coin was unveiled by the Royal Mint, in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, ahead of the 6 June anniversary. On that day, in 1944, Allied forces landed across five beaches in northern France, with the attacks given the codenames Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword.The landings were a pivotal moment that marked the start of the campaign to free north-west Europe from the Nazis.
The coin depicts Allied soldiers disembarking a landing craft, with the portrait of King Charles III on the other side.To celebrate the unveiling, the coin's design was recreated in the sand on Gold beach, in France, where troops landed in 1944.At 35 metres (115ft) across, the sand art took more than five hours to create.French sand artist Jehan-Benjamin Tarain, who created the art with fellow artist Sam Dougados, said the project had been "extremely special"."This collaboration plays an important reminder of the united allied effort between French and British forces 80 years ago," he said.
Rebecca Morgan, of the Royal Mint, said: "Coins have long served as reminders of pivotal moments in history."We are proud to unveil this tribute to the courage and resilience of British and Allied troops eight decades ago, which will serve as a permanent reminder of their sacrifices and bravery."
