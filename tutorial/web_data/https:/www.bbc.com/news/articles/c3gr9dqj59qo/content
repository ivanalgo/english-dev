The West Midlands mayor has pledged to work with businesses to create 20,000 new work experience placements, training placements and apprenticeships for young people.Labour’s Richard Parker, who took office in May, has said that tackling youth unemployment is one of his priorities.Mr Parker announced a plan on Wednesday that also included more funded training and support from work coaches for young people.The West Midlands mayor oversees seven council areas, all of which have higher rates of people aged 18-24 claiming unemployment related benefits than the national average.
The West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) has an overall rate of 8.5%, versus the UK average of 4.9%, according to a WMCA report in January.There are particularly high rates of 10.8% in Wolverhampton and 9.4% in Birmingham.
Mr Parker told BBC Midlands Today he wanted to create the 20,000 new placements in order to boost opportunities for “young people in this region, [who] have been so disadvantaged in the past”.His plan to tackle youth unemployment also includes offering fully-funded training up to Level 3, which covers qualifications such as NVQs and T Levels.Mr Parker's announcements on Wednesday formed the initial phase of his youth unemployment plan, the WMCA said.
