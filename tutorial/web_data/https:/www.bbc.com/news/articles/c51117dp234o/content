A lorry fire on the M6 left the motorway closed for hours and tailbacks of about two hours in the area.A hay lorry caught light on Monday afternoon near junction two for Coventry.National Highways said the highly combustible hay kept reigniting and urged drivers to seek alternative routes with the M6 expected to remain shut for several hours. National Highways said the badly damaged lorry needed to be cleared and teams would afterwards need to repair damage to the road surface.Heavy congestion was reported for nine miles northbound.Although traffic was being diverted off at junction two, via the Ansty Interchange roundabout, to rejoin the M6, it has left long delays on surrounding routes. 
National Highways asked people to allow extra time for their journeys or consider a different route.Road users bound for the north west from the M1 were urged to continue to junction 24 and then get off before joining the A50 westbound to Stoke-on-Trent and the A500 to reach the M6.People bound for the West Midlands from the M1 were urged to leave at junction 17 and take the M45 and A45 towards Coventry. Those going on to Birmingham could at the Tollbar End Interchange take the A45 around south Coventry and continue towards the M42 Junction 6.
