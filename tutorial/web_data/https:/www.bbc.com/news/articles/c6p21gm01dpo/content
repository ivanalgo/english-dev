Police said it was reported an unknown suspect had "damaged multiple signs" near the main road on 19 July. Katy Harrison, the park manager, said they were "used to" dealing with vandalism but the extent of the latest attacks were "surprising". "Signs have been damaged around our main entrance and in gateways, where we ask vehicles to keep emergency access clear," she said."Where gates have been attacked, there is no evidence of trespass, they seem to have been damaged for the sake of it."
Ms Harrison said it was concerning the vandalism appeared to have involved "sharp or heavy tools, and a lot of strength to punch through layers of wood and metal". "It's a shame that these essential repairs will now divert our resources away from things that would benefit more people, like looking after walking and cycling trails," she said.The park appealed for anyone with information about the attacks to contact police.
