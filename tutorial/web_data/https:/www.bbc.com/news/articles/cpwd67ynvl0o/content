Grimsby Town Foundation's Jason Land has seen his work at the club and in the community recognised with an award from the Football Association (FA).Mr Land, who is partially sighted, has been given The Hope Award for "the substantial role he has played in the development of disability football".He has been involved in disability football for over 24 years as a player and combines coaching Town's disability team with working with local schools and community groups for the Foundation.He is also Lincolnshire FAâ€™s disability ambassador and described the announcement as "absolutely humbling".
The Hope Award is named after trainee teacher Charlotte Hope, who, aged 19, was killed in a car crash on the A53 near Shrewsbury on 9 April 2022. Ms Hope was a volunteer for the charity Restart, where she distributed donated football kits to schools and charity organisations, as part of an RAF's Taking Football to Africa and Beyond appeal.
Mr Land told BBC Radio Humberside his work included going into schools and using "the power of football to get people engaged".He is also involved in wider community work including holiday activities and food programmes.The FA announced Mr Land as recipient of The Hope Award alongside Lotte Wubben-Moy, of Arsenal and England, as the winner of the Charlton Award, named after Sir Bobby Charlton, for "the significant role she has played in getting equal access to football for girls, alongside her success on the pitch".Debbie Hewitt MBE, chairwoman of the FA, said: "Our winners for this year, Lotte Wubben-Moy and Jason Land, have both shown incredible passion and determination to use the power of football to bring about positive change in society and we congratulate them on their achievements and well-deserved recognition."Both awards will be presented at an England international at Wembley in the autumn.Mr Land added: "Nobody involved in grassroots football or football development do it for the accolade, but to receive this award from the FA at the top is absolutely humbling and mind-blowing really."Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
