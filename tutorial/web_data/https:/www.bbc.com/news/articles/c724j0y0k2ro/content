Rochdale's first ever Pride parade "far exceeded" the organisers' expectations as hundreds of people turned out to join in the fun.Rochdale Council said the parade, which "looped around the pedestrianised area... in front of the newly-restored Rochdale Town Hall" on Saturday, had been "a huge success".It said highlights included those involved being led down a cat walk by drag queen Viola and a "heartfelt poem" being read by a young person who is part of Rochdale youth services about "inclusion, being accepted and recognised".Deputy mayor Janet Emsley, one of the founders of Rochdale in Rainbows, said attendance had "far exceeded our expectations" and it had been "wonderful to see The Esplanade saturated in rainbow colours".
