A former office block could be transformed into a hub to help a town's ambition to eradicate homelessness locally, if plans are approved.The proposal would see the building in Newcastle-under-Lyme, revamped to feature 12 bedrooms, showers and laundry facilities. It would also offer "drop-in support" for homeless residents five days a week, said Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council. People can submit their views on the proposals for International House, in Stubbs Gate, online until Friday, 2 August.
Staff at the hub would also help people overcome financial problems, sustain tenancies and find "local affordable homes".The facility would offer "24/7 supported accommodation", to ensure users do not sleep on the streets the next day, the council said, instead being given access to different organisations without the need of an appointment.The council secured external funding to purchase the 600sqm building. Gillian Taylor, acting service director for regulatory services, said: “As a council, we aim to end rough sleeping in the borough by 2025. "If it does occur, we aim for it to be rare, brief and for it not to keep happening for the same people.“We already run a support service two days a week and the proposals we have put forward would allow us to grow this and support more people.“The plans are now open for consultation as part of the planning process and we would welcome people’s feedback.”
