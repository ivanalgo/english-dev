A partnership between a train company and a charity for adults with learning difficulties is making fresh floral displays at stations across West Sussex.Southern Rail has worked with The Aldingbourne Trust from near Arundel for 15 years and volunteers have been out planting and installing flower beds.Hanging baskets have also been installed at stations and they will all be maintained until the autumn.The Adopt A Station programme also gives its volunteer skills in communication, independent travel and health and safety.
Karen Tyrrell, visitor and enterprise operations manager at The Aldingbourne Trust said: “Our volunteers get loads of feedback from passengers getting off the trains who say how fabulous the flowers look. “It makes them proud of what they do and know they’re contributing to their local community.“It’s great for their mental well-being too. Some of the volunteers used to spend a lot of their time quite isolated at home, especially after the pandemic, and this Adopt A Station encourages our volunteers to get out and about to meet people and be more social."
Volunteer Kieran Hellyer, 28, from Bognor said: “I’m more confident. It’s interesting and fun as well. We’ve made friends and help each other."Tracy Jarvis, corporate social responsibility manager at Govia Thameslink Railway, said: “Funding this enterprise helps the trust to demonstrate to the wider community that everybody has a part to play in society. It doesn’t matter what your ability is, there’s a value you can add to your community.”The displays are visible at the following stations: Arundel, Ford, Amberley, Barnham, Chichester, Bosham, Pulborough, Billingshurst, Christs Hospital, Horsham, Littlehaven, Crawley, Burgess Hill, Angmering, Goring, West Worthing, Worthing, Durrington and Littlehampton.
