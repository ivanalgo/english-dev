Parents who drop off their children at school by car could be fined up to £70 if they enter restricted traffic zones. Shropshire Council is extending a School Streets campaign to five schools under an 18-month pilot project, which will see traffic cameras used to monitor vehicles' movements outside the gates. The authority said the move - a measure designed to boost safety - would reduce traffic outside schools during peak drop-off and pick-up times.It stated exemption permits would be available for some residents and school staff, who would be required to supply either a proof of address or a letter from their school employer to confirm they needed street access during the periods.
Five schools are set to take part in the scheme: Gobowen Primary; Market Drayton Juniors; Woodside Primary, Oswestry; Mereside Primary, Shrewsbury; and Whitchurch Juniors. A School Street project has been in operation at Coleham Primary in Shrewsbury for several years.The council said the latest measure was designed to encourage more people to drop off children on foot, with motorists who ignore restricted zones being issued with a penalty charge notice.
The zones are set to be implemented using new regulations that came into effect last year, giving local authorities the power to enforce action against so-called moving traffic offences.Shropshire Council said letters had been sent to affected residents and parents, and anyone wishing to apply for a permit was required to upload their supporting evidence by 3 June via the authority's MiPermit parking management system.The School Streets pilot scheme will be officially launched at Market Drayton Junior School on 6 June. The council’s cabinet member for education Kirstie Hurst-Knight said School Streets had "proven to be successful in increasing active travel levels to school" as well as creating safer environments outside the gates.She added: "Where traffic is restricted on roads outside schools at pick-up and drop-off times during term, School Streets make it safer and easier for children to walk, scoot and cycle to school. "This reduces children’s exposure to air pollution on part of their journey... and from cars with idling engines outside the school gates."This news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.
