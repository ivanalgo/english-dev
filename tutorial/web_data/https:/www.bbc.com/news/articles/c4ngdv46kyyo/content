Councillors expressed disappointment after their city was ranked the worst seaside town in the UK.The survey by consumer champions Which? involved 4,700 participants sharing their experiences of UK seaside towns over the past year, with Bangor described as "drab" and "run down".Despite the negative feedback, respondents also highlighted Bangor's rich cultural and heritage assets, praising features such as the "magnificent" Victorian pier, its sixth-century cathedral, and the stunning views of the Menai Strait.The Gwynedd city came bottom of 100 places listed – scoring just 42%.
In contrast, Wales’ best seaside town Portmeirion, also in Gwynedd, was scored at 83% whilst Llandudno in Conwy was rated at 78%.Bangor, a university city, was given one-star ratings for food and drink, tourist attractions, and shopping, and received just two stars for everything else.In a statement to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Bangor City Council said: “It’s disappointing to see Bangor City named as one of the UK’s worst seaside towns. Such rankings often fail to capture the full picture and the unique charms that make Bangor City so special."The council emphasised Bangor's historical significance, noting its upcoming 1,500-year anniversary in 2025, and highlighted landmarks such as St Deiniol’s Cathedral, the Pontio Arts Centre, and the Storiel Gallery and Museum, which provide cultural and educational experiences.“Bangor City is the first and oldest city in Wales,” the council added. "With stakeholders like Bangor University and Coleg Menai, our city truly deserves to be known as a ‘city of learning, innovation, and vision'."The council also pointed out Bangor’s breath-taking views of the Menai Strait and its role as a gateway to the natural beauty of Eryri, or Snowdonia National Park."Our forebears recognized the lack of a suitable beach and found the perfect solution by building our magnificent Victorian pier at Garth Point, which now attracts over 80,000 visitors a year," its statement added.The council acknowledged that the ratings highlight areas for improvement and offer an opportunity for Bangor to address its challenges.
