A model railway club which helps people look after their mental health has found a new home.Alnwick Model Railway Club was left looking for a new base due to upcoming renovations at its current venue in the village of Rock in Northumberland.After looking for over a year it has found a new home at Newbiggin-by-the-Sea Sailing Club and will be relocating in the summer."We are very excited," member Paul Hopper said. "We were there this weekend, measuring up the room. It's just what we want."
The club will start moving after holding its last open day at Rock Village Hall on 26 May.
Rebuilding the model railway back after taking it apart for the move could take "a couple of years", Mr Hopper said. "We are going to start by building the frameworks before we can even start thinking about the railway as such."
The club has been in operation for more than 20 years, with the village of Rock being its home for the past 12.It had been looking for a new premises for more than a year with members "beginning to despair", before the sailing club stepped in. "It's going to be a fresh start and we are all excited about it," Mr Hopper said. It is hoped the move will be completed between July and August.
