Thirty one police recruits have received their warrant cards after becoming the first in a force to join a new training programme. The group was officially sworn in at an attestation ceremony which marks the start of their journey with Durham Constabulary.  All joined through the new Police Constable Entry Programme, a two-year course where most training is done alongside officers. Chief Constable Rachel Bacon said the recruits "will make a positive difference every day". 
Durham is one of the first forces to introduce what it calls "a fourth route" into policing, alongside the more traditional and longer training programmes linked to degree study. People can apply aged 17 and join at 18, with much of the training provided in-house and on the job with experienced colleagues. 
The chief constable, who witnessed the cohort's formal declarations performed in front of a magistrate, said: “It’s always a proud moment to see new officers join the force in front of their friends and family. “It’s vital for us to have the best officers with the right skills and training to prevent crime and deliver an excellent service to our communities."
