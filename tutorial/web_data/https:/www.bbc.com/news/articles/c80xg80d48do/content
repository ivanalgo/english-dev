A council has launched a two-month campaign to crackdown on fly-tippers.Sefton Council is targeting parts of Bootle where properties share rear entries.In May the authority promised a crackdown after a large amount of rubbish was found dumped behind an abandoned building in Seaforth.The campaign Why Fly Tip will feature publicity, information and a systematic clearance of rubbish.
Council staff will also go door to door to talk to residents about unwanted items and the hazards caused by dumping waste such as rats, flies and fires.Refuse teams have started to clear shared rear entries of dumped rubbish and weeds and overhanging vegetation will also be cleared.Councils and the Environment Agency both have a responsibility in regards to fly-tipping.Local authorities like Sefton have a duty to clear fly-tipped material from public land and also investigate incidents on private land and carry out enforcement actions.The crackdown has been launched in Bootle with residents reminded those who fly tip can face fixed penalty notices and fines.
Councillor Peter Harvey, Sefton Council's cabinet member for cleansing and street scene said the campaign aimed to highlight consequences of dumping waste."It costs the council a six-figure sum every year to remove and dispose of it and that's hundreds of thousands of pounds that could otherwise be spent on important local services to benefit people in the borough and nice things."That is why where we can trace the culprits, we will take enforcement action against them, which means they could receive fixed penalty notices or be faced with prosecution."Councillor Liz Dowd, Sefton Council's cabinet member for communities and partnership engagement said dumped waste was not only "an eyesore" but it also has an impact across the wider community."The illegal dumping of waste affects our fire service, utilities staff, landlords and police," she said."Weâ€™re asking the community to think about where their waste ends up and make the right choices when it comes to disposing of rubbish."
