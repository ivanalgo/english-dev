A father-of-two who died with severe sepsis after having a rib broken in row over money was found delusional and struggling to breathe by his mother, a court has heard.Daniel Bradley was kicked, punched and pushed to the ground on 9 September last year near the Brogden pub on New Road, Porthcawl, Bridgend county.Steven Chappell, 29, from Cwmdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, denies murder and manslaughter. Cardiff Crown Court heard how Mr Bradley's mother, Sheila Rees, told police her son's lips had turned blue and he believed someone was outside his bedroom window with a machete. 
The 32-year-old from North Cornelly also had mottled skin and appeared "frantic" during the visit, six days after two sets of early hours attacks. Some of the violence captured on CCTV and shown to the jury.The victim suffered a rib fracture and severe bruising.Ms Rees said she was so worried during her last home visit to her son, she called 999. "He was examined by a paramedic and Dan was taken to the Princess of Wales Hospital (in Bridgend)," she said. "I had no idea how unwell he was until the doctor said they had been attempting CPR for to 20 to 30 mins. "They managed to get his heart going again, but they said he was very sick and we could lose him."He died in hospital on 23 September. The court was told that Ms Rees first took her son to A&E two days after the attack.He had been unable to move from his bed, his nose was bleeding, his chest and side was bruised and he was surrounded by icepacks.He was X-rayed and later discharged with painkillers and medical advice.But Ms Rees said she became increasingly concerned when he became too unwell to be with his two young daughters and food and supplies had to be delivered to his front door as he lay in bed unable to move.She told detectives he asked her to visit him at his flat later in the week. When she did, Ms Rees said it was "strange" that he told her to "make sure you lock the door behind you".She said her son did not have the strength to get up to go to the toilet.The trial continues.
