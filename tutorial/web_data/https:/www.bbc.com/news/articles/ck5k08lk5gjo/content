A miniature railway is back on track in a public park after it was restored by a group of volunteers.Croxteth Park Miniature Railway is reopening in the Liverpool suburb after it closed 15 years ago, reviving fond memories for generations of families in the city.Local resident Kevin Brown who has led the volunteers' on the restoration project since September, uncovering and renovating parts of the track, said the railway had "a lot of history".   He added: "We had so many people walking past telling us their memories of when they used to bring their children or when they were children."
It is hoped trains could start running through the park again from the end of May. Councillor Lila Bennett, who represents the Croxteth Country Park ward at  Liverpool City Council, said: "I worked at Croxteth Country Park for several years and recall how popular the miniature railway was with visitors and children. "
She added it was "hard to believe itâ€™s been 15 years" since it closed.  "Lots of hard work is going into this restoration from a resident who shares his own cherished memories," she said. "This is testament to the community spirit in this area and Kevin receives our full support in this endeavour. "Together we can breathe life into the past and create new memories for the new generation."
