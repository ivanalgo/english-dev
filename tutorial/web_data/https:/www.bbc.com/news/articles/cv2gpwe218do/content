A town's theatre is set to get a new home as part of a government levelling up award.Test Valley Borough Council has appointed national architects Burrell Foley Fischer (BFF) to design and deliver the new building for cultural centre The Lights in Andover, Hampshire.This comes after the town received £18.3m in the third round of levelling up funding to accelerate two priority regeneration projects in the town.  The new premises is planned to be completed over the next three years and open in early 2027.
The Andover Masterplan, which was adopted by the council in 2020, sets out that the theatre would benefit from being positioned in a prime location with Andover bus station and the Chantry Centre car park.The scheme will see the former Poundstretcher unit, located at the entrance to the Chantry Centre, demolished before a brand new theatre is constructed in its place. The venue is expected to feature a "state-of the-art auditorium and modern spaces".BFF architects has delivered a variety of performing arts venues, both across the country and internationally, and its portfolio includes designs for Winchester Theatre Royal and New Theatre Royal Portsmouth.
Leader of the council Phil North said the panel of stakeholders who decided on the appointment had been "so impressed" with the quality of proposals though the procurement process. "BFF in particular shone out for the quality of their work and extensive expertise in the cultural sector," he said.BFF director Helen Grassly said their team looked forward to developing designs that contributed to the regeneration of the town centre and "whilst representative of the area and its history, provide a contemporary building for The Lights to expand their cultural and community offer”.The team is "set to hit the ground running", with a planning application expected later this year. Demolition and construction is scheduled to start in 2025, ahead of completion in 2026.
