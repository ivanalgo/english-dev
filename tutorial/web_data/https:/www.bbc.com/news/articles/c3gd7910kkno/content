A new Â£11m multi-storey car park with 390 spaces has opened.The facility in Crewe was originally due to open at the end of last year and is part of the long-running Cheshire East Council led Royal Arcade development in the town centre.The long stay car park on Delamere Street will be open between 07:00 and midnight, Monday to Saturday.A second phase of the Royal Arcade development was scaled back last year, but this is still a significant milestone as part of the regeneration of the town centre.
The car park includes parent and child spaces, as well as 20 electric vehicle charging points, including two for disabled drivers.There are ticketed barriers at the entrance/exit and access at the pedestrian entrance is restricted only to those who have a parking ticket and are returning to their vehicle.The building, opposite council offices at Delamere House, is next to the new bus station, which opened at the start of May.The council said the car park featured solar panels, which would minimise energy costs of the facility and new bus station.
There has been criticism, as some car parks in the town centre closed before the new one opened.The Civic Centre car park was demolished, because a new history centre was being built there. A car park on Oak Street, which closed recently, will become home to a new youth centre.
