A steep rise in "damaging" rural crime has prompted a campaign to encourage people to speak up about it using a new anonymous reporting service.According to Crimestoppers, 2023-2024, saw a 122% rise in cases in Gloucestershire compared with 2022-2023.The charity has asked the public to immediately contact them when they see things  such as arson, industrial waste dumping and drug gangs taking over the homes of vulnerable people.Beth Simpson from Crimestoppers said the illegal activity not only harms businesses, but also families, farmers and wildlife. 
Some of the main crimes experienced in Gloucestershire’s rural areas listed by the charity are burglary, theft of farm equipment, fly-tipping, county lines drug gang activity, badger baiting and arson.“We also know that organised crime gangs think nothing of harming our local wildlife, environment and communities, putting those who live and work in the countryside under threat," Ms Simpson said."Rural communities and businesses are often aware that criminal activity is happening, but for a variety of reasons they may not want to talk to the police."Ms Simpson said reporting the crimes will also help them tackle wider issues with organised gangs who tend to steal machinery and target wildlife to fund their other criminal activities or to launder money.“By telling Crimestoppers what you know whilst staying completely anonymous, whether you live in or are visiting a rural area in Gloucestershire, we can all make a difference.”
