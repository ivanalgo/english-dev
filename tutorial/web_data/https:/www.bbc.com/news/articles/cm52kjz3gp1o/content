A wildlife charity has been forced to reduce the area it serves after an "unprecedented" rise in demand. Secret World Wildlife Rescue, in Highbridge, Somerset, is currently caring for 360 animals, and now plans to reduce its catchment to a 10-mile (16km) radius. July is the charity's busiest month, and it is also dealing with a reduction in volunteers.Founder Pauline Kidner said: "This will be temporary but some of the animals, particularly orphans, require intensive one-to-one care and we have to prioritise those already in the centre."
Ms Kidner says the charity, which supports the RSPCA with rescues, has been inundated with animals such as badgers, foxes, tawny owls, hedgehogs and ducklings."The RSPCA is saturated with calls for domestic animals and can only do wildlife rescues if there is enough capacity to do it. This has obviously affected us," she added.A spokesperson for the RSPCA said the charity has "received 866 cruelty reports so far this year in Somerset alone".They added: "We will still help with rescues where our specialist skills are essential if we have officers available, however during the summer peak in cruelty, weâ€™re hoping everyone who cares for animals can play a part in helping them."
