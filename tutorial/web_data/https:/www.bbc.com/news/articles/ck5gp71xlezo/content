Work is under way to shore up a crumbing riverbank near Rolls-Royce in Derby.The Environment Agency (EA) has begun rebuilding the embankment of the River Derwent near Raynesway after “extreme flows” in the winter led to erosion.Teams are repairing the water’s edges between the A5111 Raynesway to the Midland Main Line bridge, with the project expected to be completed by October in order to protect the Raynesway area from flooding.The EA has apologised for disruption caused, particularly at nearby Alvaston and Boulton Cricket Club, where fixtures may be affected.
It added it is “liaising closely” with affected organisations.Gretchen Moeser, operations manager for the EA, said: “It is vital that these works are carried out as soon as possible ahead of this winter to ensure flood protection to the Raynesway area is maintained.
“Access with plant and machinery will be required around the perimeter of the adjacent cricket ground to carry out the necessary repairs to the flood embankment.“We recognise that this will have an unavoidable impact on use of the cricket ground over the summer months and that there may be some disruption to planned fixtures as a result.“The project team will work with the cricket club to minimise disruption wherever possible, but it is anticipated that seven-day working will be required to complete the works by October.“We apologise for any inconvenience caused by these works and thank you in advance for your support whilst these urgent repairs to the flood embankment are carried out.“We will be watching river levels very closely in this area and have contingency measures that will be put in place should there be adverse weather forecast.”The EA said the Derwent repairs were part of a wider programme of flood recovery works needed after the impacts of last winter's storms.Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
