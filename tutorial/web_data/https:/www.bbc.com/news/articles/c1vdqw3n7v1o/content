England fans landing at Manchester Airport told how they spent thousands of pounds watching their team fail at Euro 2024 but insisted it "was well worth it".Team England's campaign for a major trophy ended in heartache when Mikel Oyarzabal's late winner saw the Spaniards win 2-1 to take the European Championships in Berlin.Fans touching down close to where super-sub Cole Palmer grew up were gutted by the outcome but elated by the experience of seeing the team play.Die-hard supporter Andrew McCloud, from Sunderland, said: "It was brilliant, by far the best experience with England."He declined to say how much he had spent "in case my wife finds out".
Mr McCloud was among the England fans sitting in the Spanish section when Palmer scored his adroit equaliser."It was brilliant," he said.At full-time, Mr McCloud headed to central Berlin for a consolation drink before one hour's sleep and a 04:00 BST start to catch his 09:30 flight from Hamburg.Another fan still buzzing on adrenaline, Jacob James from Bridlington, said: "I was there for Watkins' winner in the semi-final but the whole trip was worth it for Palmer's goal in the final."Mr James, who spent £2,500 on his trip to Germany, which also included the France v Spain semi-final, said: "It has been really great seeing England in a foreign country."
His friend Oliver Watkinson, also from Bridlington, said Palmer's goal was his highlight inside the stadium."The whole place erupted - I’ve got the war wounds to prove it as everyone fell on top of each other," he joked."I was disappointed [with the outcome] but it was a great trip and we’ve got a lot of years to come – I’m sure we’ll see some glory at some point," added Mr Watkinson, who paid the Uefa face value price of £500 for the semi-final ticket and £850 for the final.
Nick Lodge, from Halifax who, like many fans, shelled out £1,200 on the black market for his ticket, is already saving up for the the World Cup in north America in 2026."It was fantastic, good experience the atmosphere was brilliant," he said, adding that he was rather hoping England will have a new manager by then.
