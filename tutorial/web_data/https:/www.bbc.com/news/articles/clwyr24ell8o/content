A new fundraising push has been launched for a famous water feature at Chatsworth House that requires repairs costing £7m.The water that used to run down a cascade of 23 stone steps at the Derbyshire attraction has been turned off because it was leaking and causing structural damage to a tunnel underneath.The Cascade was built 325 years ago, but there were fears the tunnels could collapse if the damage worsened.So far the Chatsworth House Trust has received £422,000 from the National Lottery but is aiming to raise £250,000 from public donations ahead of a bid for a fresh £5m lottery grant.
Sarah Owen, Chatsworth's director of development, said: "We know how much the Cascade is loved. We know what people think about it."The fact that we had such an outpouring of love and memories from the public. So we are inviting the public to join us in this journey."The Grade I-listed feature includes a temple housing 13 fountains from which water normally runs down over 23 different-shaped and textured giant stone steps, each formed of more than 100 individual stones.The Chatsworth House Trust - which is a charity - wants people to sponsor these stones to help it raise money.
Head gardener Steve Porter said: "We have had to prop the tunnel in the short-term to make sure it doesn't collapse and as part of the works, we will secure it and open it up again."There is a real risk here and we want to sort it out."Philanthropy manager Miles Stevenson added: “Collectively, lots of small donations will have a huge impact."Every donation, no matter how large or small will be received with gratitude."
