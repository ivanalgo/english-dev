The mother of a missing student has said "every day is difficult" more than four months on from when he disappeared. Jack O'Sullivan, then 22, has not been seen since 2 March, after leaving a house party in the Hotwells area of Bristol.His family have since launched a campaign to bring him home, with more than 34,000 people joining the 'Find Jack' Facebook group. Catherine O'Sullivan said the public support is keeping her going in the search for answers, adding: "People are so kind and so caring, offering up their time and resources."
The last confirmed sighting of Mr O'Sullivan was at 03:13 BST as he walked across a grassy area at the junction of Brunel Lock Way and Brunel Way.There were two potential sightings later - one on the Plimsol Bridge at about 03:25 BST heading back in the direction of the city centre, and another on the Bennett Way slip road on the northern side of the river at about 03:38 BST.
The community have since gathered numerous times to form search parties in the area Mr O'Sullivan was last seen. "I want the message of our appreciation to be out there, because we do feel at times very alone, and reading things like that makes us feel like we're not," Mrs O'Sullivan said.Despite the "overwhelming" support of the public, Mrs O'Sullivan believes police have failed to show "compassion and empathy" towards the family, and that there have been significant shortfalls in the investigation.The mother of two claims police have failed to properly search an area where Mr O'Sullivan's phone last pinged, near an electricity substation on Granby Hill."They couldn't confirm exactly which areas had been checked," she said."But they felt by reading their records that enough searching had been done on Granby Hill, and if we did find anything to phone them, which is extraordinary."
The data for accessing the electricity substation is recorded electronically, but Mrs O'Sullivan claims there is no record of the police ever requesting access, despite saying they have carried out extensive searches."I have such little faith in what has been done," she said."So many things have been proven to be inaccurate, and what does that leave you with?"I just don't believe anything, that's the state we live in now."In a statement, Avon and Somerset Police said that "extensive searches of both land and water using specialist units" have been carried out, and are "continuing on the advice of experts".The force added that it "recognises the familyâ€™s concerns" and an Assistant Chief Constable has "been in direct contact" to discuss how they can "best support them moving forward".Avon and Somerset Police has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), following a formal complaint from Jack's family on how the case was being handled. 
After enduring four months of "hell", Mrs O'Sullivan said recent "horrific" events in Bristol have left the family feeling more on edge than ever.Human remains were discovered in suitcases at Clifton Suspension Bridge on 10 July. Mrs O'Sullivan said the family were "left hanging with the thought" that it could be their missing son."It didn't relate to anything to do with Jack, but the first few hours we didn't know that was the case, and it's just been horrific."The thoughts that have gone through our heads have just been unimaginable." Mrs O'Sullivan said that now, any time the family hear a siren, helicopter, or the phone ring, their hearts "immediately drop" out of fear it could be the call they dread most."It's been like that from the start but the last few weeks have really, really compounded our state," she added.It took days for the family to get full confirmation that the DNA of the human remains on the bridge did not match Mr O'Sullivan.The victims were later named by police as Albert Alfonso, 62, and Paul Longworth, aged 71, who lived in London.
