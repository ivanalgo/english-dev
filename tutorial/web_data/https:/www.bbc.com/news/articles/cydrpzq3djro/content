A GP who received racist abuse after appearing on Countdown said she remained proud to be a "woman of colour with a hijab" in dictionary corner.Dr Nighat Arif, from Chesham in Buckinghamshire, began making TV appearances during the pandemic and specialises in issues affecting women's health.She praised the production team for checking on her wellbeing, but admitted she was surprised to receive racist messages on social media.Channel 4 has been contacted for comment.
The TV doctor said: "It was mostly just vitriol of what I look like. Why is she wearing a hijab? What is that thing on her head?"All I did was sit in dictionary corner and share stories from my childhood."She shared comments she had received on her social media accounts."We do have pockets - very small pockets of racism within this country, and misogyny and Islamophobia. On this occasion I thought, I'm going to tackle it," she said.
The 40-year-old told BBC Three Counties Radio there were "very few" women with hijabs on TV."There's Nadia from Bake Off, there's myself and there's Fatima, who did Channel 4 News... and that's it - so the exposure is very little."Dr Arif praised Countdown's producers and her co-stars, who had been "so lovely".She explained she was delighted to take part as she had been a fan of the show for many years.
