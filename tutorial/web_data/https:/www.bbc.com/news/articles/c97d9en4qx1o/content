Mum and baby are doing well."Amal is super excited at becoming a big sister, and Maya is very happy to be the head of our girl gang."We give thanks to God for blessing our family with a new addition."Congratulating the couple, First Minister John Swinney posted: "That is wonderful news. A warm welcome to Liyana and much love to you all."Mr Yousaf announced his wife Nadia El-Nakla's pregnancy in March while he was still first minister and said he intended to take paternity leave.He said he felt it was important to set an example that there was no "contradiction" in being a parent and holding key leadership roles.In May Mr Yousaf formally resigned as first minister after the collapse of the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.He serves as the MSP for Glasgow Pollok.Last September, he spoke about about his desire to improve miscarriage care after he revealed he and Ms El-Nakla had lost four babies - "two before our daughter was born and another two after".
