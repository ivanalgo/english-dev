Coastguard officials have advised against driving on to beaches after a vehicle became submerged at Cleethorpes.A spokesperson for HM Coastguard said they were called to reports of a stranded 4x4 and two water scooters at the Lincolnshire resort at about 11:15 BST on Saturday.It is believed the 4x4 remained stranded on Sunday evening, although the water scooters have since been recovered.No-one was injured and the vehicle's owner were said to be liaising with the council to arrange recovery, the official said. 
"We would advise against it [driving on to beaches], although we know there are certain places around the country where you can access beaches in a vehicle in order to launch Jet Skis," the official said. They added vehicles can "become submerged quickly".  "It's unfortunate", the official added. In May, a buggy belonging to North East Lincolnshire Council's Beach Safety Team got stuck while trying to help people at risk of being cut off by the tide.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
