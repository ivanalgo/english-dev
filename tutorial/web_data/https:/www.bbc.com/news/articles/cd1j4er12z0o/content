A judge has described domestic violence as "a scourge on society" and warned that those who engage in it will be jailed.Judge Neil Rafferty KC was speaking at Londonderry Crown Court on Monday, as he jailed Alex Crawford, from Kinsale Park in Derry, for a series of domestic incidents between 1 October and 15 November 2022.The 25-year-old was sentenced to 12 months in prison.He will serve six months in custody and the rest on licence. 
The court was told that police were on patrol in the city's Fountain area when they were flagged down by a member of the public who claimed a man was trying to force his way into a house.Police spoke to the woman, who said she had been in a relationship with the defendant, which had ended.She said she had told him she would leave his belongings outside the door.But when she opened the door to do so, he forced his way inside.The woman said that she tried to leave but Crawford prevented her, closing the door on her arm.
She also told police about a number of assaults by the defendant.In one case, he subjected her "to some form of strangulation" and kneed her in the ribs, the court was told.Judge Rafferty said that non-fatal strangulation was a "serious issue" but that, at the time, it was not a distinct offence.He said that all the defendant could be charged with was common assault, which "did not address the seriousness of the offending".In addition to a 12-month sentence, the judge imposed a restraining order for five years.A specific offence of non-fatal strangulation only became law in Northern Ireland on 26 June 2023.
