The owner of a hawk normally found in central and south America is urged to come forward after it was spotted in a Cornish village.The British Trust for Ornithology confirmed the bird seen in Longrock, Penzance over the last two days, was a Harris hawk.Mounts Bay Veterinary Centre, which posted about the bird on social media, said it had jesses on its ankles, which are "leather straps used for birds of prey who are in training with their handler". RNAS Culdrose, which uses birds of prey as a deterrent at its Helston airfield, confirmed the hawk was not one of theirs but had attempted to retrieve it "without success". 
The veterinary centre said it "must be missed by someone". A spokesperson for the British Trust for Ornithology said the hawk did not present a huge threat to local wildlife."I'm sure the owner will be looking for this bird and may be able to recapture it," they added.Adam Ellis, from St Justin Jewellery at Longrock industrial estate, said he had seen the bird and it looked like a "big eagle".“We’ve never seen anything like that before down here,” he said. “We’re a bit worried it’s gone missing from somewhere."Colleague Alison Thomas said it "took us by surprise", adding: “No-one has come forward to say they’re missing a bird which is unusual. It’s such an amazing looking bird, we just don’t want it to get injured."
