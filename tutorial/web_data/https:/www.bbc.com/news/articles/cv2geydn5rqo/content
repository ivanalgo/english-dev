Police investigating the murder of Newtownabbey teenager Gavin Brett have issued a fresh appeal for information on the 23rd anniversary of his death.The 18-year-old was shot dead on the Hightown Road in Glengormley, County Antrim, as he stood chatting to a group of Catholic and Protestant friends.The attack took place at about 23:20 BST on Sunday 29 July 2001, and was carried out by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA).While a number of people have been arrested in the years since Mr Brett's murder, no one has been convicted.
Police have said that Mr Brett was enjoying an evening with his friends when a dark saloon-type car travelled towards them from the direction of the Upper Hightown Road.As the car passed the friends, an occupant of the vehicle fired a number of shots in their direction before making off at speed towards Glengormley.Mr Brett was shot twice and died at the scene.A second 18-year-old man was treated in hospital for a gunshot wound to his ankle.
Police have said that they understand that two gunmen were involved in Mr Brett's murder.Det Ch Insp Byrne described the incident as a "brutal and harrowing attack on an innocent young man as he enjoyed a night with friends"."As part of our enquiries at the time – a Vauxhall vehicle was observed shortly before the attack driving in a reckless manner at the Sandyknowes Roundabout," Det Ch Insp Byrne said.“A day later on Monday, 30 July a dark blue Vauxhall Nova saloon vehicle was located burnt out behind shops at Ballyearl Drive, New Mossley."We also believe this car was connected to the investigation."The senior officer added that he was appealing "for anyone who may have been in the Hollybrook Road area or the surrounding streets before or after Gavin’s murder and who may have seen the attackers to speak with police".
He said that "despite the amount of time that has passed since Gavin’s murder it is not too late"."If anyone now feels they are able to talk to us about any information they may have, we are ready to listen."Mr Brett's father, Michael, a paramedic, was nearby when the shooting happened and tried in vain to help his son.Michael Brett has also since died, "never seeing his son’s killers brought to justice", Det Ch Insp Byrne said.Mr Brett's mother has appealed for anyone with information to "please help my family find peace".“So much time has passed since my son was murdered. Someone must know who is responsible," she said.
