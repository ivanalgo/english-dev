A sex attacker who subjected a woman to repeated rapes before preying on a second victim has been jailed for five years.Steven McMath, 24, formerly of Dumfries, had denied a series of charges at trial but was found guilty of the two rape offences in his home town.At the High Court in Edinburgh, Lord Fairley told him he had been convicted of "very serious crimes".He added: "It is clear to me from the victim impact statements I have seen your offending has had a profound effect on each of these women."McMath raped his first victim on about 10 occasions in September and November 2018.
He sexually assaulted the woman while she was asleep and continued with attacks after she woke up.McMath raped the second woman on a single occasion between August 2020 and January 2021 when she was pregnant, after demanding she have sex with him.Defence counsel Callum Hiller said of McMath: "He continues to protest his innocence."He said he was a first offender and still a relatively young man and was a teenager when the offending began.In addition to his jail term, Lord Fairley ordered that McMath should be under supervision for a further three-year period once he was back in the community.During that time he will be under licence and can be returned to prison if he breaches its conditions.McMath was placed on the sex offenders' register for an indefinite period.Det Insp Kelly Douglas said: â€œMcMath is an abusive individual who showed no remorse for his abusive behaviour."I would like to commend the women for their bravery in coming forward during the investigation and I hope this outcome provides them with some sense of closure."If anyone is experiencing, or has experienced domestic or sexual abuse, please do not hesitate to contact us directly or through one of our partner agencies."
