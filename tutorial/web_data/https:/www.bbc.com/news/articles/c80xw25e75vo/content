Colchester Zoo has unveiled "multi-million" pound plans to build a new African lion habitat.The Essex-based attraction said it hoped the proposed project would pave the way for a new breeding programme.Graphics have shown the 3000-sq-m habitat would have shrubland planting areas, dens and bodies of water to encourage the animal's natural behaviours."This is a project we have been wanting to start for several years," said the zoo.
It added the development was subject to additional surveys and planning permission being secured.
The new habitat could be created via an expansion of the existing Edge of Africa section, already home to a male African lion.Viewing platforms would be built across two levels inside, with further vantage points to see the lions outdoors.Jonathan McLoughlan, an architect from DEARADH ZÚ, said the "activity-based design" would promote animal wellness."Visitors will come face to face with not only lions within the indoor habitat, but also with an array of other species," he said."One of the key aspirations of the scheme was to maximise the lion’s space on such a challenging site."Mr McLoughlan said to do this, the lions would be given access onto the roof of one of the buildings for a "unique viewing experience".
The zoo said a "significant investment" worth millions of pounds would be poured into the development."It will be a while before the first spade hits the ground," the attraction added.Once the habitat was completed, zoo leaders would be able to introduce a new pride and start a breeding project.The African lion is listed as "vulnerable" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) red list of threatened species."[Thus] making the conservation for the future of this species vitally important," a spokesman for the zoo added.
