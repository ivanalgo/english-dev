Energy efficiency at four council venues is to be boosted with the awarding of a grant of more than £2m.Sunderland City Council has given the green light for the money to be spent on venues it owns, including the city's Museum and Winter Gardens.The grant has been awarded as part of the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme (PSDS), which is in its third stage of government funding.The other buildings that will benefit are the Evolve Business, Bunnyhill and Leechmere centres.
According to a cabinet report, the grant funding will achieve significant energy demand reduction, resulting in expected carbon savings of 515 tonnes a year, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.Senior councillors also agreed to award £410,100 from Sport England’s Swimming Pool Support Fund to Hetton Pool, to be spent on solar panels.Councillor Michael Butler, cabinet member for children’s services, said being greener mattered, especially to younger people."One of the main things with this is that our young people continuously tell us that this is one of their most pressing issues," he said. "Hopefully this goes some way to show that we actually care about the youth of the city."
