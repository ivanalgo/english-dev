"I would urge anyone with information about what happened to get in contact with us as soon as possible.“Alfie’s owner had been left distraught by his cruel death and wants justice for him."He said they were asking people in the area if they had any CCTV or doorbell camera footage which could help, or if they recalled seeing any suspicious activity between 19:00 on Wednesday and 10:30 on Thursday.“We are also warning horse owners in the area to be extra vigilant, given the appalling nature of this crime,” he added.Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
