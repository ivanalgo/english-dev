Two pubs in east Suffolk which closed after their managers stepped down have reopened.The Eel's Foot Inn in Eastbridge, and The Bell Inn in Middleton shut their doors on 17 March.Owners Adnams, the Southwold-based brewery, reopened both pubs over the Easter weekend, serving only drinks.Nick Attfield, director of hospitality and retail at Adnams, said it was "a mammoth and wonderful achievement" reopening the pubs in time for the long weekend. 
"We’re very pleased that both pubs returned to trading over the long Easter weekend, with the teams having been re-employed," Mr Attfield said.“For this first few days, we consciously focused on serving only drinks, but will now commence getting the kitchens back up-and-running so that we can provide a full service."He said the brewery was "enormously grateful for the support and kindness shown to these pubs". The former landlords of both pubs, Julian and Kayleigh Wallis, previously announced on Facebook they were stepping down. They said it had not been the "easiest decision" and cited increasing bills and health concerns as reasons for their decision.
