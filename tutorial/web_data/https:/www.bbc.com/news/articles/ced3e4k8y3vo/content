A dog owner has been charged over the death of a man fatally mauled by two XL bullies.Ian Price, 52, died in September after being attacked by two dogs outside a property on Main Road, Stonnall, near Walsall. James Trimble-Pettit, 31, of Fradley, Staffordshire, will face two charges before magistrates in September.Just hours after the fatal attack on the father-of-two, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the XL bully breed was to be banned in England and Wales.
Mr Sunak said the dogs were "a danger to our communities" and would be banned by the end of the year.Other people killed by XL bullies include 68-year-old Esther Martin, 54-year-old Ian Langley, 17-month-old Bella-Rae Birch and 10-year-old Jack Lis.Mr Trimble-Pettit has been charged with two counts of owning a dog dangerously out of control where death is caused, under the laws in place at the time of the attack.Ownership of XL bully dogs is now restricted under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.Since 31 December 2023, it has been against the law to sell, give away, abandon or breed from an XL bully.Since 1 February 2024, it has been a criminal offence to own an XL bully without an exemption certificate.In January, the Scottish government announced it would also impose safeguards on XL bullies, similar to those in England and Wales.
Staffordshire Police said specialist officers continued to support Mr Price's family. After Mr Price's death, his close friend Rob Ellwood paid tribute to the 52-year-old, saying he loved walking his own dogs and Aston Villa."He would have done anything for anyone, he was a patriot, a gentleman, a tradesman and a scholar," he said."A pillar of the community, Ian will be sadly missed by all who knew him."
He described Mr Price as a devoted husband, father of two, son, and brother."It is of no surprise to all who knew Ian that his first love was his family", Mr Ellwood said."He would often talk of their achievements and how incredibly proud he was of them."Another friend, Dave Turner, described him as "a very prominent part of village life, always there to help people".He said his friend's death had sent "a shockwave throughout the village".
