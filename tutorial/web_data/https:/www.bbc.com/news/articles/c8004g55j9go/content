People have been learning life-saving skills at the States of Jersey Ambulance Service’s Open Day.Crowds and families were shown what happens during an emergency or at a major event on Monday.Voluntary agencies like Normandy Rescue, St John Ambulance Service and the Community First Responders were also in attendance.Organisers hoped more people will sign up and volunteer for these services after the open day.
Jason Hamon from the States of Jersey Ambulance Service said it was to showcase how volunteer organisations “support us, the community and to get some more recruits to help them”.“You're never too young to learn basic life support because it gives us precious extra seconds between someone collapsing and the ambulance arriving,” he said.Dozens of people came to the Ambulance Service Headquarters to see more from the groups.Mr Hamon added St Ambulance Service and Normandy Rescue “were a major asset during covid, the Haut du Mont explosion, and were on standby for Storm Ciarán as well”.
Normandy Rescue provides medical and rescue cover to more than 100 events a year in Jersey.Helen Clayton from the charity said the event “encouraged adults and kids to get involved in voluntary medical services” and said they had “quite a lot of interest”.“We need people who are interested in medical careers in order to staff the hospital and ambulance service and being a volunteer with groups like us is a really good step towards getting into those careers,” she added.Normandy Rescue volunteers occasionally work with St John Ambulance volunteers to cover events.
Mark Jarvis from St John Ambulance Jersey said the voluntary agencies needed to work together in the island because of the demand.“We do have to turn events down sometimes because we get so busy and we don't have enough members to cover them safely,” he added.Mr Jarvis also said the agencies have “definitely got a lot closer” over the last year and events like the open day “help drive up event cover by getting more adults to sign up as members”.St John Ambulance is one of the biggest aid charities in the British Isles and teaches and provides first aid and emergency medical services.
