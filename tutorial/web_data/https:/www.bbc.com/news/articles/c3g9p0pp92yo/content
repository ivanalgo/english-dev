The new fast ferry which will take passengers between the Isles of Scilly and Cornwall has arrived in Newlyn Harbour.Atlantic Wolff, a 138ft (42m) catamaran with a top speed of 28 knots and seating for more than 400 people, had been due to start operating in May, but was delayed.Shipbuilder Harland & Wolff (H&W) said the vessel was due to start its "eagerly awaited" schedule between Penzance and St Mary's early next week after sea trials.Scilly Ferries, part of the H&W Group, will run up to two return sailings a day into the autumn as the weather permits, said the shipbuilder. 
Next year the ferry would operate between April and October, the operator said.John Wood, chief executive of H&W and Scilly Ferries, said the service was what "the local community has been calling for over many, many years" and would "bring much-needed tourists to the islands and boost the islands' economy"."We know from meeting people locally there is a huge pent-up demand and I'm looking forward to it being a great success," he said.The Isles of Scilly Steamship Group, which currently serves the route, is building two new passenger and freight vessels.
