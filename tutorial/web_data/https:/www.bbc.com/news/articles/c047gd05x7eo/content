A second elephant sculpture has been targeted by vandals a day after a charity art trail was launched.The piece, one of more than 70 elephants on show in parks, streets and open spaces in Lichfield, Tamworth and Sutton Coldfield, has been withdrawn from the display.A spokesperson for St Giles Hospice, the charity behind the March of the Elephants fundraiser, said it was "really heartbroken that the actions of the few could ruin it for the many."The large sculptures, painted by professional artists, are set to be auctioned off in September.
The latest sculpture to be damaged, called Tamworth Pigs, was found on Tuesday, and has been deemed unsafe."This is the second sculpture that has been damaged in just two days, and at this stage, weâ€™re all truly lost for words," said the hospice.
On Monday, another sculpture, called Vince, was found knocked over in Lichfield.The charity said it, the artists, schools and the local community had worked hard on the project, and urged people to keep an eye on the remaining elephant sculptures."Our elephants are works of art, to be admired but not climbed on," it stressed.
The sculptures have been "hidden in plain sight" across the three towns, and people are able to follow the March of the Elephants trail using an interactive app.The hospice said a number of its supporters wanted to make a donation following the damage.It has set up an online fundraiser, and hopes that Vince and Tamworth Pigs will be able to return to the trail.
