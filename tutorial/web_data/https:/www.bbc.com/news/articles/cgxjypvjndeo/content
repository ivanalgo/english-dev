Safety sessions are being offered to open water swimmers following a rise in the pastime's popularity.RNLI Cullercoats hosted its first session with swimmers on 16 December to teach them what to do in an emergency.Geoff Cowan, water safety officer at RNLI Cullercoats, said: "We have had one or two incidents in recent months were people have gotten into difficulty and have had to be rescued by the lifeboat."The RNLI plans to host more safety session in the new year.
Open water swimming grew in popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic but not everyone knows what to do in an emergency.Mr Cowan said that many people "underestimate the sea" and are unaware of its risks, such as cold water shock.He said: "If somebody gets out of their depths and gets swept out to sea they may not be able to get back to the shore themselves and this is where they may have to call upon the lifeboat."
During the safety session, RNLI volunteers were able to provide tips on staying safe in the water while allowing swimmers to ask questions about specific scenarios.Swimmers were urged to never go open water swimming alone and to carry a means of contacting the emergency services.The public are urged to call 999 and ask for the coastguard if they see a swimmer in difficulty.The Dip Club is a group of swimmers who swim at beaches along the North East coast.Amy Padgett, from the Dip Club, said: "Never take risks. Never go in if you don’t feel right about it. "You can still have fun on the beach and hang out with people but, at the end of the day, safety is key and if it looks dangerous, don’t go in."
