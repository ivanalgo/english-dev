A great-grandfather took on a 15,000ft skydive to raise money for veterans. James Mckellar, 88, from Horley, in Surrey, has raised over Â£1,000 for the Royal British Legion (RBL). The former RAF armourer said he was inspired by the 80th anniversary of D-Day. He said: "I wanted to do something special - so I jumped out of a plane". 
Mr Mckellar, who served in Germany during the height of the Cold War, is a member of the 1366 Armourers Branch of the RAF.He has raised money for veteran charities for more than 50 years. 
He has completed 100 marathons, an ultra marathon and even learned to swim to compete in a triathlon age 74. After a poignant visit to the Normandy D-Day memorials two years ago he said he "felt a kindred spirit".He said: "When I was five, I was bombed out of London in the Blitz. On D-Day I was 8 years of age. "When they were asking for fundraisers for the RBL 80th anniversary appeal I thought 'I have to do something special'."He took on the skydive at an airfield in Salisbury on 16 June, supported by his proud family.He was also cheered on by fellow decorated armourer Ian Thomas, which he said was "an honour". 
Mr Mckellar said the experience was "absolutely amazing".But he said jumping out of a plane was easier than getting donations, and he has not yet reached his target. He said his main message was to remember the fallen veterans who gave their all: "When you meet and see a veteran, treat them with respect, shake their hand and give them a hug because they are a generation we will never see again."
