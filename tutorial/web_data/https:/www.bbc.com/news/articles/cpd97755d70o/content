A South African man is hoping to break records by sailing the smallest boat around the world.Greg Were, 33, said he planned to begin the voyage in Falmouth before sailing around Africa, across the Indian and Pacific oceans, around South America and back again to Cornwall.He plans to complete the unassisted, non-stop circumnavigation on his 20ft (6.1m) yacht, called Hummingbird.The voyage is set to leave this week and is estimated to take about a year.
The current record was set by Polish yachtsman Szymon Kuczynski, who sailed around the world in 2017-18 in a 20.6ft (6.3m) yacht without stopping or receiving any assistance.Mr Were has previously sailed Hummingbird from South Africa to the Netherlands, with much of the journey undertaken solo. He described being in a small boat in a large ocean as "quite gnarly"."It's sleepless and tiring," he said."If you imagine something that works every muscle in your body and then tenfold it - it's basically extreme exertion. You're just hanging on for the ride."
Reflecting on the challenge, he said: "For most sailors, one of the primary concerns is going overboard - it's something you dread and also something you accept."He said he had prepared by running through various scenarios in his head."I'm not just chasing the thrill of open waters," he said."The fact that nobody has achieved this on such a small vessel gives me an extra push."Hummingbird and I will undoubtedly face obstacles, but I believe we can conquer them."
