Medway Council in Kent has confirmed the date when a series of red routes will come into force on five key roads.It was announced in April that road users would be fined for stopping, parking or loading their vehicles in certain parts of Rochester, Chatham and Rainham.Work to replace the current double yellow lines with double red lines has been carried out ahead of the scheme launching on 20 May.The council said it hoped the red routes would reduce traffic in heavily congested areas, and that any money generated through fines would go into road maintenance and repairs.
Overnight line painting work ran from 4-10 May. Traffic cameras and new signs are currently being installed.Medway councillor Simon Curry previously told the BBC: “The new red routes are great news for residents and everyone using Medway’s roads.“By tackling congestion, we can help people get where they want to be faster, while making our roads safer.”Red routes will be in operation in:RochesterChathamRainhamDrivers can only park and load their vehicles in specific bays along the routes.They will be fined for stopping, loading or parking their vehicles anywhere else along the routes at all times.
