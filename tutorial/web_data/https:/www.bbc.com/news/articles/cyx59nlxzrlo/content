A man who fell from height at a HS2 construction site suffered a fractured skull, jaw and pelvis.He was working for EMC Elite Engineering Services in West Hyde, Hertfordshire, when he fell 11m (36ft) through a gap in a stairway, positioned alongside a conveyor belt, on 20 November 2022.The 57-year-old spent two months in hospital, where he had surgery requiring him to have six plates inserted into his face.A Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigation found the Essex-based engineering firm failed to ensure work at height was properly planned, supervised and carried out as safe as reasonably practicable. It received a £52,500 fine in court.
In a victim statement, the worker said his wife had become his carer.He added: "The injuries I sustained have had a massive impact on my life and some of these will be permanent."My own behaviours have changed. I am quicker to anger and get easily frustrated. I get very impatient too. "My focus has been affected and I struggle to keep up with a task or maintain a conversation."EMC Elite Engineering Services, based in Basildon, admitted breaching working at height regulations.As well as the fine, it was ordered to pay £6,871.12 in costs by St Albans Magistrates' Court.HSE inspector Martin Paren said: "If his employer had properly planned, instructed and supervised the work then this incident could have easily been prevented."
