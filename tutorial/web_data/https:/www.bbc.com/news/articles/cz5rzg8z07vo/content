Business leaders have commissioned a study to look into options for potentially reopening Plymouth's fish market. The market closed in May after Plymouth Trawler Agents ceased trading. The city council, Sutton Harbour Company and Plymouth Fishing and Seafood Association are now working together to look at options.The study will review the former market and look to find ways it could be improved for local fishers, merchants and buyers.
Since the closure of the market, the port has continued to operate with fish landed in Plymouth sold in Brixham and Newlyn.The city council said there was "clear demand" from vessel operators and merchants to have access to a fish market locally.Council leader Tudor Evans said "the fishing industry in Plymouth is really important" and "nothing is off the table".
The Council said the study will look at the "type and extent" of the market and the steps needed to operate one in the short and medium term. It will also consider the longer-term sustainability, both economic and environmental, of a Plymouth-based market and operator.Plymouth Trawler Agents, which ran the fish market for 30 years, ceased trading over concerns in changes to fish quotas and increased operating costs.Edward Baker, from Plymouth Fishing & Seafood Association, said the study would help to make "Plymouth fishing fleet and other surrounding ports thrive".He added: "We believe a market in Plymouth is integral to that and we are grateful for the support of Plymouth City Council and Sutton Harbour Company in the development of this study to see if we can make a market work again in Plymouth".The report is due to be finished by March 2025 but it is hoped parts of the study can be put in place before the start of the local cuttlefish season in September 2024.
