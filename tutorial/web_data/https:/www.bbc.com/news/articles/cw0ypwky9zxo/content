A much-missed toyshop and cinema are at the heart of a museum's nostalgic new addition.Beamish Museum's 1950s Town is getting ready to open its parade of replica shops on Saturday.The attraction features recreations of Ryhope's Grand cinema and Middlesbrough's Romer Parrish toyshop, along with a record shop, electrical store and milk bar.The cinema will be opened by the Grand's former projectionist Bill Mather who said it had given him "absolute great pleasure" to play a part in rebuilding the venue.
After training at the Grand, Mr Mather had a 53-year career managing and owning cinemas."The icing on the cake is to have been asked to carry out the grand opening of my 'Palace of Dreams'," he said."I have opened my own cinemas over the years, but this one is special to me as it's where it all started in 1950."Meanwhile the toy shop, which was loved by generations of Teesside children in its original form, will be opened by Brian Parrish, Romer Parrish's son.
A Reece Ltd Radio and Electrical Services shop and a STEM learning space are also opening on Saturday.The shops have been created as part of the Remaking Beamish project.Chief executive Rhiannon Hiles thanked the tens of thousands of volunteers who have played a part in the project and said this weekend's opening celebration marked an "incredibly exciting and significant moment for the museum".
