A teenager accused of murdering a 15-year-old girl in a stabbing lied about where he was to her friends before attacking her, a court has heard.Holly Newton was stabbed multiple times in Hexham by a 16-year-old boy who she said had been "stalking" her, Newcastle Crown Court was told.The boy, now aged 17 and who cannot be identified, denies murder.Jurors heard voice messages he sent to Holly's friends in which he claimed he was 23 miles (37km) away in Newcastle when, in reality, he was waiting for her in Hexham.
The court has heard Holly told friends the boy was "stalking" her and her mother had reported him to police on 27 January 2023 after he stood outside their home in Haltwhistle the night before.Also on 27 January, he sent messages to a friend of Holly's asking for her help in getting Holly to meet him.In a video interview shown to jurors, the friend said she told the boy not to go to Hexham that day, adding she thought it was a "bad idea".The girl said Holly had been "nervous" about leaving school that afternoon because she feared the boy may be outside, so her friend messaged the youth to ask if he was in Hexham.She said the boy claimed he was in Newcastle and asked her "why would I be" in Hexham.
Jurors have seen CCTV footage showing the boy was actually in Hexham where he was waiting in a park.Holly and some friends walked into town after school, spending time at Wentworth Leisure Centre before visiting some shops, the court heard.Jurors were shown footage of the youth following them for about 45 minutes, including the moment prosecutors said he appeared to duck down to avoid being seen by Holly in a supermarket car park.The court heard the boy also made multiple WhatsApp calls to Holly that afternoon but she did not answer any of them.At about 17:00, the boy confronted Holly outside Pizza Pizza in Priestpopple and then attacked her down a neighbouring alley, the court has heard.The boy also denies wounding another youth who ran to try and help Holly.The trial continues.
