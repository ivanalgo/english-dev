A safety warning has been issued after a ground floor kitchen was completely destroyed by a tumble dryer fire. It happened in Burry Port, Carmarthenshire, earlier this month, with firefighters spending two hours making the scene safe. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service issued advice, including never to leave tumble dryers unattended or to overload them. The force said they "contain powerful motors with fast-moving parts that get very hot", with the warning following other incidents earlier this year.
In March, Emma Vaughan from Denbigh received a call with the news that her home was on fire. Her tumble dryer had caught alight and the utility room it was in had reached temperatures of 300C (572F).Fortunately she said, the door was closed, meaning the other rooms were not ablaze, however they were damaged by the smoke.In April, Rhian Price, a BBC Wales journalist said she was “very grateful” to a passer-by who woke her and her family to save them from a house fire on 9 April.
