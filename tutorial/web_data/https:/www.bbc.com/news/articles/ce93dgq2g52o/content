New housing is being proposed for the next phase of a major city centre regeneration scheme in Chester.The first phase of the city's Northgate development saw the introduction of a new market place, restaurants, cinema and a car park.Cheshire West and Chester Council is now consulting on a plan to bring residential properties to the scheme, on a site which includes a former shopping centre and office buildings.The authority will be asked to approve the process to find a developer for the plans at a meeting on 31 July.
Earlier stages of the development included the new Chester Market and a cinema, which opened at the end of 2023.Documents submitted to the council’s cabinet said the authority was seeking “high quality new homes within a residential community” on the site as well as improved connectivity with the existing development.The documents said the city “lacks residential occupancy”.It also said there had been “considerable interest from developers” for the site and that “numerous” businesses had put forward informal proposals.The council estimates it would need to invest £500,000 over the next two years to develop the process.Nathan Pardoe, cabinet member for inclusive economy, regeneration and digital transformation, said it was an “exciting next chapter”.The council would look to begin working with a preferred development partner early next year.
