Modern pentathlete Charlie Brown has said he is "incredibly grateful" to be called up as a late replacement at the Olympic Games.The 20-year-old from Kidderminster was selected after his teammate Myles Pillage  was withdrawn from the games due to a calf injury.“To compete at an Olympic Games this early on in my career is something I am very proud of," Mr Brown said."My results have really accelerated since my senior debut, 18 months ago, and I am so excited to represent Team GB and give it all I’ve got."
Mr Brown added that he was "extremely gutted for my teammate and friend, Myles.""He is an incredible athlete, who works exceptionally hard, and I wish him all the best with his recovery," he said.Speaking to BBC Hereford and Worcester in April, Mr Brown said being selected for the 2024 games would be a shock and his sights were set on competing in 2028.He said: "It would mean a lot because this is my childhood dream being an Olympian, however it would be a bonus."The fact that I'm in contention of Paris is something I wasn't expecting a year ago or even two years ago," he added.The modern pentathlon will take place between August 8-11.
