Plans have been revealed to transform farm buildings in the south of the Isle of Man into a new Manx language centre and lecture theatre. The proposals would see the refurbishment, restoration and extension of a cottage, barn and an old corn mill on the Mullinaragher estate in St Mark's into a modern centre.The application has been made by charity Caarjyn ny Gaelgey, which means friends of the Manx language, after it was left the land following the death of the former owner Jane Rodgers.The complex would include an education centre and student accommodation, with the cottage retained as the residence of the centre's manager.
While the primary use of the buildings would be a Manx language centre with students staying in the accommodation on-site, the facilities could also be used for conferences, lectures and school trips, the application said.The ages of the three buildings are not known but they were cited in maps that date back to 1864.In its application, Caarjyn ny Gaelgey said former owner Miss Rodgers had expressed a wish that the barn, cottage and corn mill be used as a place for the promotion of Manx heritage, which included the progression of the speaking of the islands native language.
Accommodation would comprise four double rooms, for attendees from both on and off-island and the site would be used for an "immersive" Manx course catering to both newcomers, and existing Manx speakers.Two staff members would run the kitchens during the courses.There would be 17 car parking spaces made available, and the vehicle access for the two entry points to the site from Mullinaragher road would be widened.
