A man has been jailed for eight years for stabbing a man who confronted him for slashing his tyres.Shaun Charles struck Christopher Knight three times in the stomach with a 10-inch hunting knife in Greenock, Inverclyde on 16 October 2021.Mr Knight managed to keep a hold of Charles until the police arrived despite his injuries. Charles, 26, pleaded guilty to assaulting Mr Knight to his severe injury, permanent disfigurement and to the danger of his life.
Judge Kevin McCallum KC said that Mr Knight had showed "remarkable bravery" when he confronted Charles, intending to detain him.He told Charles: "The knife used was a fearsome weapon that can properly be described as lethal, if not murderous."The High Court in Glasgow heard that on the morning of the attacks, Charles had been in an argument after being caught smashing a window of a property in Greenock.
Shortly afterwards Charles turned his attention to a Vauxhall Insignia car and began slashing its tyres. He then did the same to an Audi.Mr Knight spotted Charles using the blade to puncture the tyres of his Ford Focus. The court heard he seized hold of Charles, who then stabbed him in the struggle.Mr Knight was taken to hospital with injuries described as life threatening.Frances Connor, defending, said that Charles, of Kilwinning, Ayrshire had been the victim of an attempted murder six years prior to the attack on Mr Knight.
