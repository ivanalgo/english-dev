The University of Bradford's apprenticeships provision has been upgraded from "requires improvement" to "good" by Ofsted.In 2022, the university was deemed by inspectors not to offer a "consistently high standard across all faculties" related to its training courses for apprentices.This month Ofsted upgraded its rating for the apprenticeship programmes and reported that changes to how teaching was monitored had driven up standards.Inspectors noted some concerns, including nurses having their 'learning experience' impacted, but said action was being taken to address them.
The latest Ofsted report stated that leaders now had "effective oversight of the quality of their apprenticeship programmes".Students on the level 5 nursing associate apprenticeship had been "negatively impacted" by staffing changes and workplace challenges, the document added.Since the last inspection, Ofsted found that leaders and managers had taken action to ensure that apprentices were appropriately recruited and inducted. Before enrolment, staff now "carefully check that applicants have the necessary English and mathematics qualifications and the prior skills and knowledge needed for their programme". The University of Bradford works with employers including the NHS and Morrisons to train apprentices to degree level.There are programmes in chartered management, chemistry, social work, healthcare science and nursing.Paul Watson, the university's pro vice-chancellor for learning, teaching and student experience, said: "We are truly delighted with this outcome. "It reflects the commitment and expertise of all those involved in delivering and supporting our apprenticeship provision and the nearly 300 learners currently studying with us."Mr Watson added the university wanted to work with more businesses to build a portfolio of "high-quality degree apprenticeships" and that the report "is an important step in that direction".Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
