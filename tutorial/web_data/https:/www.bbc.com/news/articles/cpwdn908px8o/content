A plan to build 120 homes in Lincolnshire has been recommended for approval, after it was previously turned down on a number of occasions.The application is for land off Heron Walk at Apex Lake, to the south of Newark Road in North Hykeham.It was refused in the past amid concerns about its ecological impact and after receiving 178 public objections.Now, the revamped proposal has been backed by planning officials at North Kesteven District Council (NKDC).
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), the first application in 2020 was for 150 homes on the site, which covers 62,000 sq m (667,000 sq ft).After being turned down on subsequent occasions, the plans were amended to reduce the number of dwellings and make 20% of them affordable housing.About 5% would be self-build plots, while an open space scheme has been proposed within the council’s recommendation.Council officers have suggested that the developer should include funding towards facilities in the area, including £55,000 for provision of bus services, a healthcare contribution of £632.50 per dwelling, and £36,734 towards additional primary education capacity.There have been no objections raised by NKDC’s environmental services and highways departments, or from Natural England, the local tree officer and the Environment Agency, according to the LDRS.The application will be debated at a council planning meeting on 9 July.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
