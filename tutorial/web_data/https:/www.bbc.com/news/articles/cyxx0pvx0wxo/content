Snow has been falling over some of Scotland's highest mountains with wind chill forecast to be -10C in the most exposed areas.The Cairngorms were among upland areas to see a dusting on Tuesday.Mountain Weather Information Service (MWIS) said Arctic air was affecting the hills, especially in the Highlands, and there had been significant wind chill.BBC Weather said snow on mountain tops in June was not that unusual, and usually happened every three to five years on average.
In 2010, more than 100 skiers took advantage of ski tows being open at the Cairngorm Mountain resort near Aviemore for the first time in midsummer.Previously at this time of year people were able to ski in the Cairngorms, however, they had to trek to where the snow was.Two temporary rope tows were provided over two days.Cairngorm Mountain, along with Scotland's other mountain ski centres, had benefited from lengthy periods of freezing conditions over the winter.
MWIS said the latest weather included a forecast for a mix of hail and snow falling over high ground.It added: "Temperatures are likely to recover a little by the weekend and conditions will tend to improve, but good mountain weather is expected only from Monday onward."
