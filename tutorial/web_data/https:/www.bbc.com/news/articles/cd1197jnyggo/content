An 83-home development will go ahead on the site of a former police headquarters after it was approved by a planning inspector.The Planning Inspectorate has given Cala Homes permission to develop the land still occupied by Warwickshire Police in Woodcote Lane, Leek Wootton.Warwick District Council had opposed the scheme due to concerns over its scale and impact on nature and heritage.But, the planning inspector concluded it had "significant benefits" which outweighed other considerations.
The site consists of open grassland and smaller parcel currently being used for parking, in the setting of Grade II-listed Woodcote House.Cala Homes was refused council planning permission twice and appealed after the authority failed to reach a decision in the prescribed timescale, the appeal decision said.In his 44-page decision, the planning inspector outlined his reasons for allowing the appeal.He considered whether the development complied with the local plan, and its impact on the setting, highway safety, and conservation area."It is clear that there is a significant need for market and affordable housing in Warwick," the inspector wrote. "The housing would make an important contribution to meeting that requirement."He added the delivery of 40% affordable homes would be "very welcome" and smaller units would meet the need for first-time buyers and young families.He also concluded the development would be acceptable in highways and pedestrian safety terms.
Residents have previously protested against the plans, citing concerns over wildlife.The planning inspector ruled any harm to the character and setting of Woodcote House and local conservation area was offset by the scheme's benefits.He imposed conditions limiting the number of dwellings to 83, and a requirement for detailed plans of protection for wildlife during construction.He also asked for a scheme to show how woodland areas would be used for recreation and public access.The inspector judged the council's decision should be overturned as the proposal delivered "significant benefits, particularly in relation to housing and supporting Leek Woottonâ€™s status as a growth village".While the development conflicted with the local development plan, "material considerations indicate that a decision should be made other than in accordance with it", he concluded.Cala Homes has submitted an application for costs, which will be considered at a later date.
