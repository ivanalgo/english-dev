A huge "amphetamine lab" described by police as one of the largest ever found in the UK was discovered during early morning raids.Four men were arrested and 60kg (132.2lb) of amphetamine was seized after the searches at addresses in Lancashire and Wigan. The laboratory was being dismantled at an address in Clitheroe, where chemicals used to make the Class B drug were also found. The raids were part of a co-ordinated Greater Manchester Police operation cracking down on organised crime and money laundering in the Wigan area. 
The force said a 77-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of money laundering and permitting premises to be used to produce Class B drugs. Three men aged 43, 52 and 62 were also held on suspicion of conspiracy to produce Class B drugs and money laundering. Det Insp Patrick Wood said officers remained at the scene of the laboratory gathering evidence. He added: "There is no doubt these drugs would have been sold into communities fuelling violence, exploitation, and misery, which we have prevented today through proactive policing."
