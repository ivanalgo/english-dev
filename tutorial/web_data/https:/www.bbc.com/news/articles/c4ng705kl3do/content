An XL bully dog is to be destroyed after its owner was taken to court by West Yorkshire Police.On 26 June, Kirklees Magistrates' Court dealt with a total of four cases in which police had applied for a destruction order for an XL bully. The breed has been illegal to own without an exemption certificate since a ban came into force in February.Magistrates granted the order for one of the pets, but told three other owners they were "fit and proper" people to manage their dogs and allowed the animals to remain at home.
Magistrates heard that Jamil Rajas, of Rossett House, Otley Road, Bradford, had told the police he had taken on responsibility for an XL bully called Pablo after his son, the previous owner, was disqualified from keeping animals.Mr Rajas did not appear before magistrates, who decided that Pablo should be put to sleep unless an appeal was lodged within 21 days.They agreed with West Yorkshire Police's application that Pablo was a risk to the public due to "previous attacks, the temperament of the dog and a history of escape attempts".Mr Rajas was also deemed to be not "fit and proper" due to the circumstances of the case.No order for costs was made from Mr Rajas.
Magistrates also heard the case of Danny Blyth, of Joan Royd, Heckmondwike, who was ordered to apply for an exemption for his XL bully, called Roman, within two months.The magistrates found his dog posed "no danger to public safety" and that Mr Blyth was capable of controlling the animal, which had already been given back to him under the interim exemption scheme. Mr Blyth was told to pay West Yorkshire Police's costs of £300.Meanwhile, Destiny Bradbury, of North Street, Dewsbury, appeared at the same court in relation to an XL bully called Buffalo.Magistrates agreed the owner was "fit and proper" and ruled an exemption should be applied for, with £350 costs to be paid..John Hetherington, of Lodge Hill Road, Ossett, was also told his XL bully, called Reggie, would be returned to him under the interim scheme on the condition he applied for an exemption. He was ordered to pay £300 costs.
The Dangerous Dogs Act was updated in December 2023 and now requires owners of XL bullies to keep their pets on a lead and muzzled when in public.Since 1 February it has been illegal to own an unregistered XL bully, while selling, breeding, exchanging, advertising and gifting the dogs was also banned.Last month a Doncaster woman was fined for owning an unregistered XL bully called Chunkz, which will not be returned to her until it has been assessed by police canine behavioural experts.Samantha Link, 37, of Sprotbrough, was allowed to keep another dog in her care that had been seized along with Chunkz, but which was deemed not to be a banned breed.She was fined £120 by Doncaster Magistrates' Court and ordered to pay £1,350 in compensation and £85 in costs. A contingent destruction order was passed for Chunkz.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram. Send your story ideas to yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk
