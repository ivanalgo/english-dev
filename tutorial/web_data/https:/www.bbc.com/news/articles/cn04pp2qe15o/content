A lifeguard service may be axed at two beaches in Somerset because of council cuts.The RNLI lifeguards were brought in at Burnham-on-Sea and Brean after the death of four-year-old Dylan Cecil in 2013.Somerset Council said the move was not something "we would ever want to be considering", but it has to find £100m to balance its budget for 2024/25.Council budget proposals say ending the lifeguard contract with the RNLI would save £35,000 per year.
Somerset Council has a contract with the RNLI to provide a lifeguard service on the beaches at Burnham-on-Sea, Berrow and Brean from July until September. The authority said the beaches would remain open and continue to be staffed by beach safety wardens employed by the council between March and October. Beach safety wardens are trained in first aid and land-based rescues.Any water-based rescues would need to be dealt with the RNLI lifeboats or other emergency services.The RNLI declined to comment on the council proposals but said its purpose is to save lives at sea.
Amber Long, who runs a hair salon in Burnham-on-Sea, said: "We absolutely have to have them there because we've had too many deaths."I mean just look at little Dylan. We definitely need people there. "I think there's a lot of other places the council could save money but it doesn't need to be in saving a life," she said.
A spokesperson for the authority said: "Somerset Council is in an unprecedented position due to the rising costs faced by local authorities across the country, largely driven by costs of social care.“If we cannot set a balanced budget, government commissioners will do it for us, without the local knowledge or concern about the longer term."It is asking people to take part in a budget consultation which runs until 22 January.
