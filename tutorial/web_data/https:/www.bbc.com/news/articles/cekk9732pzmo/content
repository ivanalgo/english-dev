The start of demolition work at the Les Ozouets campus has been called the "end of an era" by former staff and pupils.The work is part of the programme agreed by the States to redevelop the site into the new post-16 campus run by the Guernsey Institute.Executive principal Jacki Hughes said the work would take a few weeks to be completed and it was hoped lessons at the new campus would start in January 2027.Les Ozouets was home to the old St Peter Port School until it shut it 2009 - after about 40 years of being open - after which it was used by the College of Further Education from 2011 to 2022.
Ms Hughes said the demolition work marked a milestone for education on the island.She said: "By creating a state of the art environment it means we are going to be able to train our young people, our apprentices and our adults for the work places of the future. "We've heard from employers that some of our environments and our facilities do not reflect, what particularly the apprentices, experience in the workplace."So we have got to get ready for the 21st Century."
Former head teacher Peter Sherbourne said he many wonderful experiences during his time at St Peter Port School."It's a bit sad to be here today to see it finally coming to a close," he said."Although it will be replaced by something that I believe the island needs badly."It's a sad end of an era but hopefully for better things."
Martin Search, a former pupil of the school, was also at the site as demolition work started.He said he remembered it being state of the art at the time he went there and he had fond memories of being a pupil there."I met some fantastic friends who kept me going, the teachers were very good and of course we had corporal punishment back in those days, so it kept us on the straight and narrow," he said.
