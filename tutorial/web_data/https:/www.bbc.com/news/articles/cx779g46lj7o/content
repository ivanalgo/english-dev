The government’s wildlife watchdog has raised concerns over a proposal to build more angling platforms along the River Wye.Hereford and District Angling Association is seeking planning permission to construct 28 more wooden “pegs” on the protected river.But Natural England has said further alteration to the riverbanks “could prevent the restoration of both bankside and in-channel habitat”.About 60 anglers have lodged messages of support for the plans, which would be upstream of Hereford's Greyfriars Bridge. 
Herefordshire Council said it aims to decide on the application, which remains open for comments, by 14 June.Natural England, which advises the government on the environment, last year downgraded the River Wye’s health rating, after a decline in species such as salmon and native crayfish.
In its six-page submission about the proposals, the advisory body said fishing platforms could mean the loss of bankside vegetation and soil, while their construction and upkeep would include removing trees.It added the stretch of the river was a haven for fish in winter, but loss of vegetation and shade could harm such wildlife.When the existing fishing platforms were approved in 2015, “it was agreed between parties, including the applicant and Natural England, that no more platforms were required”, it said.Among messages of support, angler Richard Coggins said the existing fishing platforms had been “a huge success” and were “used extensively by the local kingfisher population as a perch". “Far from damaging the fish habitat, the platforms provide shading and consequently there will be more cover for fish, not less,” he added.Hereford and District Angling Association declined to comment.
