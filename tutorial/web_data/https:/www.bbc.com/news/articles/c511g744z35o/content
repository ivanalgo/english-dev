A charity has given Cambridge University £5m to help fund cardiovascular disease research.The British Heart Foundation (BHF) said it had made the award to support its "world-class" research into the disease over the next five years.Bosses said money had come from a "research excellence awards" funding scheme.A university academic said the money would support multiple research programmes.
"Research Excellence Awards offer greater flexibility than traditional research funding, allowing scientists to quickly launch ambitious projects that can act as a springboard for larger, transformative funding applications," said the BHF in a statement."The funding also aims to break down the silos that have traditionally existed in research, encouraging collaboration between experts from diverse fields. "From clinicians to data scientists, biologists to engineers, the funding will support universities to attract the brightest minds, nurture new talent and foster collaboration to answer the biggest questions in heart and circulatory disease research."The BHF said the university had previously been awarded £9m through the scheme.
Prof Bryan Williams, the BHF's chief scientific and medical officer said: “We’re delighted to continue to support research at the University of Cambridge addressing the biggest challenges in cardiovascular disease. "This funding recognises the incredible research happening at Cambridge and will help to further its reputation as a global leader in the field.“With generous donations from our supporters, this funding will attract the brightest talent, power cutting-edge science, and unlock lifesaving discoveries that can turn the tide on the devastation caused by heart and circulatory diseases.”
Prof Martin Bennett, BHF professor of cardiovascular sciences at Cambridge University, said: “This is a fantastic achievement from the whole Cambridge team. "This award will support our multiple research programmes identifying new targets and treatments for vascular disease and heart failure, new ways to reduce the consequences of diabetes and obesity, and how we can get our research used to treat patients.”
