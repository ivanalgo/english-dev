Flumes at a leisure centre pool have been temporarily closed for "urgent" repair work over the summer following a routine health and safety check.Colchester City Council will invest an estimated Â£70,500 into the pool at Leisure World Colchester.The flumes are expected to reopen in September after maintenance work to reline their internal surfaces has taken place, said a council spokesperson.Martin Goss, council cabinet member for leisure, said: "We understand the timing is less than ideal, especially during the school summer holidays, however, the leisure pool will remain open."
While maintenance work is taking place, the council said it will also be investing in the pool's outdoor rapids which are expected to reopen in October.Visitors will still be able to access the water cannons and slides as well as other features in the leisure pool."We appreciate our community's patience and support whilst we undertake this work," added Mr Goss.
