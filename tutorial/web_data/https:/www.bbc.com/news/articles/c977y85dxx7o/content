A woman who has had skin cancer twice is urging people not to use sunbeds.Caroline Madden, 58, from Welton, East Yorkshire, regularly used them in her early 20s and was first diagnosed in 2009. There is no way of knowing if sunbeds were to blame, but Skin Cancer UK wants mandatory warning signs in all tanning places, like those on cigarette packets.The Sunbed Association says professional sunbeds are well regulated, children are banned and guidance is provided on the number of sessions allowed.
Ms Madden was diagnosed for a second time in 2018, resulting in surgery and lengthy hospital stays. She is now registered disabled.“I just thought I looked better with a tan and back in those days we didn’t know the dangers,” she said.People did not realise there were different levels of skin cancer, she added, and melanoma could be "deadly".
Skin Cancer UK, a patients' support group, is concerned social media is fuelling interest in sunbeds among young people and is calling on the government to revise legislation.Ross Robinson, an ambassador for the group, said patients had told him that seeing graphic warnings on sunbeds would have put them off. Ms Madden said she would like to see all sunbed shops banned as there was "no advantage to them whatsoever”.However, Sophie Hare, who owns Hare and Beauty, in Ruskington, Lincolnshire, said her clients used her sunbed for many reasons, including some health conditions.She has warning posters in her salon, although they do not include pictures and she doubted a graphic image would make a difference to her customers.“Everybody knows that sunbeds have that danger that comes with them, but I think it’s just personal preference,” Sophie said.
Gary Lipman, chairman of The Sunbed Association, said: “Professional sunbeds are already well regulated in the UK, with legislation prohibiting use by under 18s."Sunbeds must comply with a British Standard, which dictates maximum UV output and provides guidance on protective eyewear and the number of sessions people should take, he added.A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “Children are banned from using sunbeds because there is a risk that UV radiation from them will cause skin cancer." Clear guidance on the risks associated with sunbeds was provided by NHS England and the UK Health Security Agency, "so users can make an informed decision", the spokesperson added.Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
