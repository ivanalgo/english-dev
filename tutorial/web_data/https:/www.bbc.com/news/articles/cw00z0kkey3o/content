A Nottinghamshire secondary school has confirmed it will axe its sixth form, saying it has become 'unsustainable'.The Dukeries Academy, in Ollerton, said it could not offer the number of subjects students expected.School bosses said from summer 2025 it would concentrate on securing suitable places for continuing education at larger sixth forms nearby.But the academy's governing board called the decision "unacceptable" and said it was made with no consultation.
Those who have already started Year 12 will continue but no new students will be enrolled and the provision will cease in summer 2025.Current Year 11 pupils who have been conditionally offered a place at The Dukeries for September 2024 will be helped to secure a place elsewhere, officials said.Trust executive principal, Ged Rae, said the academy's sixth form was "unsustainable".He added: "Although the decision is exceedingly difficult, it is the right decision for our pupils. "We need to focus on ensuring they have access to the very best opportunities at larger local sixth form provisions where there is currently an excess of high-quality places available."The academy's governing board said it had demanded a meeting with the trust.It said: "We wish to publicly express our deep disappointment with the decision to close the sixth form at The Dukeries Academy."As a local governing board, we strongly feel that the process of coming to this decision has been unacceptable, with no consultation with the board, the school community or the local community."The school said it would operate as an academy for 11-16 year-olds from September 2025. It added that with pupil numbers in Key Stage 3 and 4 growing, it was expected to be close to its capacity of 900 pupils in Years 7 to 11 by September 2026 and therefore discontinuing the sixth form would not require a reduction in staffing levels.Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
