A newly-upgraded £7m roundabout has been dubbed a "white elephant" on the online service Google Maps.Work on the scheme, in Clophill, Bedfordshire, which began in March last year, has recently been completed.But various social media pages have been created to share mock images, including The Nelliebout.Central Bedfordshire Council said the improvements had "increased capacity".
Funding for the works was secured against tough national competition from the government’s Levelling Up fund, it added. Amanda Marques, from Clophill, questioned why the council had bid for the money.  "There are plenty of other projects they could have done that would have added more value rather than tormenting us with a project which we did not need," she said."On all counts it is a complete fail for the council."
Ian Summerfield, from Maulden, said: "They could have done a lot more with the money and the roundabout does not look any different."It is a white elephant, all that money, it could have been put in the health service."
Louise Wisson, from Ampthill, said: "It just shows that the local people – particularly the community of Clophill – just see the whole works as a little bit of joke."We have seen no improvement. "I am sure there will still be accidents on the roundabout, unfortunately. The lane systems don’t work and it is just not an improvement by any means."
In a statement, the council said: "The improvements have increased capacity, allowing more vehicles to get through the junction at the same time, and people should experience shorter journey times."
