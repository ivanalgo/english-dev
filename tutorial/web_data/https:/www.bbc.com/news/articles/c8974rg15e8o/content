Vaughan Gething wanted to offer Welsh Labour a fresh start.His predecessor Mark Drakeford became associated with a policy that provoked a furious backlash: Wales’ 20mph law.He handed over the reins as NHS waiting times soared and doctors threatened more strikes.Against that backdrop, Mr Gething promised a government "focused on what matters most in people’s daily lives".He made early announcements, designed to show the new guy was in charge.A review of the speed limit could mean 30mph zones return to some roads. A deal with doctors over pay ended their industrial action.There was, however, no honeymoon for Mr Gething.
His leadership campaign accepted big donations from a businessman in the waste and recycling industries, but who was previously convicted for environmental offences.Mr Gething has repeatedly had to fend off attacks from political opponents and questions from journalists about the money.But the most dangerous interventions always come from a politician’s own side.Defeated leadership rival Jeremy Miles told us in April he would not have accepted those donations, giving us a glimpse into the discontent that existed within Welsh Labour.When the first minister needed the support of his members in a confidence vote, he got it from all those present.But the absence through sickness of two of them – including one he sacked over a damaging leak against him – meant the vote was lost.
It all added to a feeling in Welsh Labour that things could not carry on like this. Not even the resounding victory in the general election changed the political weather.All these issues, and Mr Gething’s handling of them, were rehearsed in the resignation letters he received today.The three people who quit with Mr Miles backed him for the leadership – a fact that will not be lost on Mr Gething’s supporters.Some of those supporters have also said that attacks on him were racially motived.In his resignation statement, the first black leader of a national government in Europe addressed "those in Wales who look like me – many of whom I know feel personally bruised and worried by this moment".This is not how any leader would want their time in office to end.But in truth, Mr Gething never really got going.
