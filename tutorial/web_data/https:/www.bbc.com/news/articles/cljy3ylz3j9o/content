There was not much time to rest for a newly elected MP, as he was called out to a mountain rescue less than 24 hours after being voted in.Josh MacAlister was elected for Cumbria's Workington and Whitehaven constituency at about 02:15 BST on Friday.The Labour MP said he was looking forward to a relaxing afternoon and an early night after staying up late, but instead he was responding to a call-out at 23:00 BST.Mr MacAlister said: "I hadn't been able to do any call-outs during the election period and prior to that I had had a shoulder injury, so I thought this was my first opportunity to go out for a long time."
The casualty Mr MacAlister and his teammates were called to was airlifted to hospital in Carlisle and is believed to be recovering, he said.
The new MP was back home by 02:30 BST, about 24 hours after being officially elected to the role.He added he was "well and truly" ready to go to bed by the time he returned."I had had enough adrenaline and enough late nights for a considerable period of time," he joked.Mr MacAlister has been part of the mountain rescue team for three years, and said he intended on continuing in the role when in the area.He said he became involved, like many others do, because of his love of the fells and the desire to help people."I really love doing it, I'm going to try to continue being involved as much as I can as a Member of Parliament."He added the tasks carried out as a mountain rescue volunteer were much more practical, and he was hoping that doing the two things together would give him some balance.When asked how he would react if a casualty recognised him as their MP, he said: "I think it's so out of context that I'm hoping it doesn't happen - I'd rather not distract them, but actually sometimes people are in quite a lot of pain, so the distraction might be useful."I'm just keen to muck in with the team and do my bit."
