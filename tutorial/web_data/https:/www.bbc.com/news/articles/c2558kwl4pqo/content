A yet-to-be-built railway station could be expanded if Universal builds a theme park close by, a council says.An outline planning application was originally approved more than 20 years ago to build the station at Wixams, a new town, close to Bedford.Bedford Borough Council said the original costs of about £27m had increased by an additional £30m, and it could open in 2026.If Universal builds the attraction on a 480-acre plot of land south of Bedford, "we will require a much bigger station to be constructed – happily at central government expense," Conservative councillor Graeme Coombes said. 
In 2018, the council took over the project, which would run on the Midland Main Line. By 2022, the cost had risen to £39m and further increases were due to inflation, the council said. "If we don’t get this done in time we’re at risk of losing quite a bit of [Community Infrastructure Levy] CIL money [from] developers", Mr Coombes said.“We don’t want to do that, we don’t want to lose money,” he said.
It is hoped it could be operational by the second half of 2026. The Local Democracy Reporting Service said the authority's executive heard that the plans would change if the Universal plans go ahead.  "If the Universal Theme Park project goes ahead, it is undoubtable that we will need a station that has capacity for all of the expected visitors," Mr Coombes said.
