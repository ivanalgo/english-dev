A 45-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, in connection with the disappearance of a man from Warwick.The woman, who is from Warwick, was arrested by Warwickshire Police on Tuesday and has been bailed pending further enquiries.Stefan Watkins was last seen leaving his home on 6 May 2023."We remain open-minded and truly hope he's alive and well, however the information we've gathered so far suggests he may have come to harm," said senior investigating officer Gareth Unett.
Initial inquiries by police suggested that Mr Watkins had travelled to Coventry in the early hours of 7 May 2023, however there is "no confirmed proof of life" after CCTV showed him leaving his home the day before.Investigations into Mr Watkins' disappearance continue.He is described as white, about 6ft (182.8cm) tall, with blue eyes and very short hair."It was the King’s coronation on the day Stefan left home so we hope this might help to jog people’s memory," said Det Insp Unett."Given the length of time that has passed, it's important to get closure for his partner and we continue to provide updates and support to her."
