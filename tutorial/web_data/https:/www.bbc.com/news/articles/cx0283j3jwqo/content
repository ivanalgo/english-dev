The difference in life expectancy for people living across different areas of a town has been branded "disgusting" by a councillor.A report found the gap between people living in Darlington's best and worst areas is 10.6 years for women and 13 years for men.Green councillor Matthew Snedker told a council meeting: "The fact it’s natural for there to be a 13-year life expectancy deficit across this town I find disgusting."North-east England also saw the highest increase in child poverty over much of the previous decade.
Labour-led Darlington Borough Council approved its latest plan on Thursday, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service.Included is a commitment to ensuring everyone has the opportunity for a good job, home and social connections."We want opportunities to be accessible to everyone," the council report said."We will have a long-term focus on understanding and addressing the causes of inequality ensuring our communities are safe and can thrive."
However, the council is facing "unparalleled" financial challenges, the report added.Reductions in public spending between 2010 and 2019 meant that its budget was reduced by £46m in real terms - a 36% reduction. Mr Snedker, the local Green Party leader, said councils should receive more funding from the government to overcome the challenges.He told the meeting: "We have a huge task ahead of us. The money is out there, it needs to be sent to local authorities who know our communities best. "I will be calling for full long-term funding, not one-year settlements and not having to beg for money from a grant."
