"Folk music isn't something that is just for a certain generation."As Warwick Folk Festival returns for its 44th year, marketing manager Hannah Wright says she wants to show people that folk music can be for everyone.From morris dancing to daily countdowns during the event, she says she has been posting online to help the festival attract a younger crowd at its base in Castle Park."We've been working really hard on our social media," she added.
Events will also be held in the centre of Warwick to celebrate the music including morris dancing processions and gigs in local pubs.
Celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary in style at the event are Mary and Derek Droscher.The couple got married at the festival in 1999 and have regularly attended since then.From bunting to glasses of Prosecco, the pair have adorned their camping area with celebrations.Mr Droscher said their marriage had been "absolutely wonderful" over the 25 years.
Lotte Cummins, 18, was just three months old when she visited the festival for the first time."One thing that is so different about folk festivals is that everyone will welcome you."There's no judgement, it feels like a home away from home," she said.
The festival is run almost entirely by volunteers including Bryan and Rita Bellingham who started volunteering more than 40 years ago.They said they were training younger people to help out as mobility issues and age were "catching up" with them."It will be strange not doing anything but I think we might still come [to the festival]," Mrs Bellingham added.The event will run until 28 July and features a range of artists including the Oysterband and The Unthanks.
