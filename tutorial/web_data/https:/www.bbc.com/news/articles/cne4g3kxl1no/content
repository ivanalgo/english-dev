A supermarket rebranded for the day as shop workers helped a boy celebrate his fifth birthday.Morrisons in Stirchley, Birmingham, became Harrisons on Sunday as staff threw a party for young Hari and his friends.Hari had told his mum Sophie that he wanted to have his celebration at the Hazelwell Street store because it was his “favourite place”.Asked what the best part of the day was, he told BBC Radio WM: “Going round and shopping.”
As well as letting the children shop at the store with their little trollies, staff at Morrisons booked a DJ and even let Hari work on the checkouts.Sophie said Hari grew to love their local Morrisons during the Covid lockdowns.
He was just six months old when the first came into force and the store was one of the few places the family would go out to for much of the following two years.“It was the first day out for him and I think it really cemented a great appreciation for our local Morrisons,” she added.As well as being made a special Harrisons shirt, Hari also received a customer assistant badge and a certificate of achievement from the store.
David Taylor, community champion for Morrisons in Stirchley, said it was nice to help Hari fulfil his dream.“It was just like a real party. Customers were standing at the checkouts smiling and joining in,” he added.
