Delays to some cervical screening results letters being sent out have been caused by the introduction of a new IT system, Manx Care has confirmed.The health care provider said there had been a hold-up during the changeover of the management system for sending invitations and results letters.A spokeswoman Manx Care said while the new system used to cover both the island and England was "working as expected", there had been a delay in results letters being sent to some Manx people."We would like to reassure people that abnormal result letters have not been affected and continue to be sent in a timely manner," she said.
Manx Care said the issue had now been fixed and a "small backlog" was being being worked through "as quickly as possible", she added.Women on the island aged between 25 and 49 are offered the procedure every three years, while its available to those between the ages of 50 and 64 every five years on the island.
