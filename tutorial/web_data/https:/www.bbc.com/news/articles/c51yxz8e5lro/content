A Reform candidate has previously posted "deeply concerning" material on social media, the Campaign Against Antisemitism said.The posts appeared on the X, formerly Twitter, feed of Antony Antoniou, Reform UK's candidate for Northampton North.As first reported by Sky News, the posts included antisemitic conspiracy theories and a link to a video defending Adolf Hitler.Mr Antoniou said these were automated posts from news feeds and there was "no way" he would post anything antisemitic.Reform UK has been contacted for comment.
The posts, found by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, showed "an obsession with the Rothschilds", the group said.There was also a post stating the "world defeated the wrong enemy" during World War Two.The posts have since been deleted.Stephen Silverman from the campaign group said: "This is deeply concerning for somebody who is standing to be elected to Parliament."He said they were examples of "despicable views".
Mr Antoniou said the posts were put up when he would "hobby post news" from RSS - automated - news feeds.He said he "didn't even know what was being posted". These were "five or six" posts from "about 71,000", and there were other posts "that were the opposite", including criticism of antisemitism, he added.The candidate also said: "Just because you say to someone 'look at this' doesn't mean you support it."Reform UK has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.
