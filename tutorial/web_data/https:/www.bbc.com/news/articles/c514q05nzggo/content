A new attraction is being planned for Alton Towers' Forbidden Valley area which is also home to the newly rebuilt Nemesis ride.The existing Funk n Fly ride will be replaced by the new feature - if plans are given the green light by Staffordshire Moorlands District Council - but the full details are being kept under wraps for now.The proposed attraction will sit atop a concrete structure and have an overall height of around 18m (59ft).Permission is also being sought for a storage building.
A statement submitted as part of the application said the idea was to increase the amount of people staying in the Forbidden Valley and improve attraction availability in that area of the park.“With the reopening of the popular ride Nemesis alongside existing attractions Sub-Terra, Blade and Galactica, it is believed guest numbers will increase in this area and a further attraction will aid in both dwell time, ride availability and keeping the area fresh,” it said.The proposals have already been welcomed by thrill-seekers, who’ve commented on the plans on the council’s planning portal.
