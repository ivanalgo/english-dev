The first of the Isle of Man's major annual agricultural events is set to take place this weekend. Held at Orrisdale Farm in Ballasalla, the Southern District Agricultural Show showcases the Manx farming industry to thousands of visitors.As well as livestock competitions, the 2024 show will host a vintage tractor parade, dog agility classes, an archery display, and free Zumba sessions.Show secretary Zoe Hampton said the event was an important opportunity for the agricultural community to get together and the public to learn about farming on the island.
The showground opens to the public between 09:30 and 18:00 BST on both days, with the Grand Parade, which sees the Supreme Champion animal crowned, scheduled to stat at 16:00 on Saturday.
Last year the event attracted about12,000 visitors over the two-day period. During the show the public can visit local food stands, view arts and crafts on display and witness stock judging.Ms Hampton said in the past the event, which was first held in 1914, was one of only a a few opportunities for the agricultural community to get together, but now created a good chance for farmers to "get out" and "talk to people".
Ms Hampton said while the scrapping of the Isle of Man government's annual Food and Drink Festival in September was "sad", she hoped those with an interest in local produce would visit the agricultural show to see what's on offer.Reflecting on the wet weather experienced on the island over the past 12 months, she said it had been a "difficult year" for farmers, particularly those growing crops.The conditions also made a "big difference" to turnout at the two-day agricultural show she said, adding: "Hopefully the sun is going to shine."
