A public meeting has been called to discuss plans for 800 homes on green belt land.Developer Boningale Homes wants to build an estate on an area between Newhouse Lane, Holyhead Road and Cross Road in Albrighton, Shropshire.The plans also include a new secondary school and 70-bed care home.But the Albrighton Village Action Group said it would lead to a 60% increase in the size of the village, and that brownfield land should be used instead.
More than 3,000 people have signed a petition opposing the proposed development.Claire Lakin from the action group said the plan "threatens our status as a village, destroying 56 hectares of countryside in the process".She added: “There are lots of brownfield sites that can be remediated first – the only thing stopping developers is that they can’t make as much money doing it that way.”Boningale Homes development manager Dean Trowbridge said there had been a "mixed reaction" to the plans at a previous meeting, but added there was a "housing need" in the county.The gathering, which will be attended by the MP for the area, Mark Pritchard, takes place on 16 May at the Red House community venue.He pointed out the site had not been identified as being suitable for development in Shropshire's Local Plan.Mr Pritchard added: "Albrighton’s green belt is precious, it must be protected, and I will fight these developer-led proposals all the way."Representatives from Boningale Homes are also due to be present.
