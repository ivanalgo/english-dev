A life-long rugby fan is so confident his team will win the premiership he has already had a tattoo dedicated to his team and a cancer charity. Tom Craven, who supports Bath Rugby, now has "COYB Champions 2024" tattooed on his upper right thigh after the team's winning semi-final match against Sale Sharks. Although he is optimistic that the team will win the Premiership on 8 June, he said the main reason for getting the tattoo was to raise awareness for the Testicular Cancer Society. “It’s all for a good cause, and at the end of the day, Bath are going to win so it’s not really that much of a gamble," Mr Craven added. 
Mr Craven had always planned to get the tattoo prior to the final, in a bid to "bring some attention" to the cause. It comes after his previous work and challenges with the "nifty" charity, which aims to promote early diagnosis. 
“There was a lot of discussion about what happens, where it goes, what we do with it."He added that it would have been a "travesty" to place the tattoo elsewhere on his body. 
According to the Testicular Cancer Society the condition is the most common form of the disease in men between the ages of 15 and 35. It is highly treatable if caught early. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, depending on the extent of the spread. The charity encourages men to check for symptoms from their adolescent years. 
“It really does highlight what goes on", Mr Craven said. "I thought it was a great idea and I’ve always wanted to something to celebrate Bath. "At the end of the day, if they lose I can always put a line through the “champions”. "It’s not the end of the world.”
