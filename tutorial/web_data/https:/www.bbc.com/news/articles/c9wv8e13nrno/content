The family of a Dumfries woman who died in Crete 15 years ago has said police in Greece are reopening an investigation into her death.It would be the fourth investigation into Jean Hanlon's death, and follows a report being passed to prosecuting authorities from a private investigator.It identifies a man he believes was with Ms Hanlon on the night she disappeared in Heraklion.Her son Michael Porter, who hired the investigator, described it as a "massive, massive breakthrough".

Jean Hanlon's body was recovered from the sea off Heraklion on 13 March 2009, four days after she disappeared.At the time she died the 53-year-old had been living in Crete for a number of years, working in bars and tavernas.A post-mortem examination concluded she drowned but information later suggested there may have been a struggle.Her son told the BBC that he had found out on Wednesday from his lawyer that the case had been reopened once more.“This is due to the recent events of us hiring a private investigator who has put together an in-depth 24-page report," he said.“This is absolutely massive for us, there is no way they couldn’t have done this."He said the private investigator had been able to "answer a lot of unanswered questions" including identifying a man who was with her on the night she went missing.
"The past 15 years has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs," he admitted.“You get to a certain point like now where the case is reopened when you have got all new found hope and strength and then you get chopped back down.“However, the massive difference in this is that we have hired the private investigator who has put in and filed this detailed report.”He said that hopefully made things "very, very different".“There is no way that they can shut this down again," he said.“I am actually 100% hopeful that this is the time that we get our mum justice and that she is finally laid to rest."
For the last 15 years Ms Hanlon's family has campaigned for a re-examination of the case  having been frustrated with the Greek police investigations.Her case was reopened in 2019 following a television documentary but it failed to secure a breakthrough.In 2020 the family issued a fresh appeal on the Greek equivalent of Crimewatch.A third investigation was opened in 2021 but was closed due to lack of evidence.Now a fresh probe looks set to begin into events from 15 years ago.Michael Porter is continuing to fundraise for the family's legal fight and is planning a skydive for the Justice for Jean campaign.
