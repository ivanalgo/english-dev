A charity manager has expressed frustration over increasing tool thefts as data shows only a fraction of reports to Kent Police lead to charges.Kent Wildlife Trust's Stephen Weeks made his comments after data showed 1,385 tool theft reports had been made in the last year, but only 38 charges, summons or postal requisitions were carried out.The data also showed in 2023-24 the total number of tool theft reports was the highest since before the pandemic.Supt Pete Steenhuis said the force investigated every incident based on the evidence available.
The number of tool theft reports to Kent Police had increased every year since the pandemic, when the force received 1,865.Mr Weeks said the charity's tools had been targeted a number of times, with about £40,000 worth of items being stolen in the last five years.“It's become such a frequent event," he said. "When this first happened years and years ago you'd get very angry. Now, it's really just a sense of frustration that this keeps happening despite the efforts that we put in place to improve security."This, Kent Wildlife Trust, is a charity. We want to be using all our money for restoring nature across Kent."
The area manager said he was pleased with the response from Kent Police to the thefts, but investigations needed more resources.He said: "If the police have more officers, more dedicated rural crime teams to be able to pursue these people, then that would certainly help.”Mr Steenhuis says Kent Police's rural task force works closely with local businesses to investigate reports and reunite owners with stolen property where it can."Simple measures such as removing tools from the van overnight, parking in well-lit areas and installing security measures in the van can help deter thieves."
