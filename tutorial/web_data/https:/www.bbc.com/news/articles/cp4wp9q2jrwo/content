Two men are aiming to kayak 150 miles (240.4km) along canals from London to Leicestershire to raise money in memory of a sea cadet leader.Del Martin was a kayak instructor with the Loughborough Sea Cadets but died at the age of 60 in February after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2022.Rob Hutchinson, 50, from Loughborough, and Paul Jewell, 47, from Coventry, set off on their 10-day journey on Friday and are hoping to reach Loughborough on 4 August.An online fundraising page set up to raise money for the sea cadet group and the Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Association has raised more than Â£2,000.
Mr Martin had been with the sea cadets for more than 10 years, but was forced to leave following his diagnosis in March 2022.His widow Sarina, 59, from Shepshed, said: "He was a fun character who loved teaching the cadets kayaking and catering, but being in the water was his favourite."
Mr Hutchinson, whose daughter is a sea cadet, said: "Del was a great bloke, dedicated to the sea cadets, who loved his fishing and his football."He taught the cadets water sports but was diagnosed and eventually forced off the water as he deteriorated. Sadly, he then had to step away from the cadets all together. "Paul and I decided we wanted to do something to help the sea cadets so I discussed it with Del's wife Sarina and we thought this paddle would be the best thing to attempt."Paul is relatively new to kayaking and one of the major challenges will be the 150 locks."Whenever we get to one we'll have to lug our 25 kilo (55lb) boats, and our 25 kilo kit, out of the water along whatever terrain we face to get round them."It will be a real obstacle course."
Ms Martin said she was asked last year, before Del died, if they could attempt the challenge to raise awareness of the condition, which she said was "very humbling"."What they are doing is absolutely amazing," she said."It's very emotional because Del would have wanted to be a part of it in some way to support Rob and Paul and the great cause."But we know Del will be with them in spirit."Sharon King, MND Association's regional fundraiser for the East Midlands, said it was a "very tough challenge"."We are so grateful to Rob and Paul for their amazing effort to support the MND Association, in memory of their friend, Del," she added."Thanks to their incredible efforts we can continue to support those with MND and their families and continue to invest in cutting edge research to hopefully find a cure for this brutal disease."Follow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
