A man who sent aggressive and threatening messages to the House of Commons Speaker has been given a three-year restraining order.Mark Innes, 56, admitted emailing Sir Lindsay Hoyle with disturbing images and threatening him on a social media post.Innes, from Chorley, Lancashire, offered an apology in a police interview and told officers he had "no intention" of harming Sir Lindsay, who was recently re-elected as Speaker.At Preston Magistrates' Court earlier, Innes was also handed a six-week prison sentence, suspended for two years, for crimes committed under the Malicious Communications Act 1988.
The court heard how Innes initially emailed Sir Lindsay to express his concern around the events in Gaza.Innes took issue with the reply from his office and on 21 December and responded with an aggressive email with disturbing images.On 24 January, Innes then posted a threat on social media directed towards Sir Lindsay.In a police interview, Innes said he had sent the messages as he "was frustrated by what was going on in the world". 
Joanna Crook, senior crown prosecutor for Crown Prosecution Service North West, said the staff member who opened the email and read the post was "severely impacted by their distressing nature" and told police "she had not slept since".Innes was charged with two offences of sending an electronic communication which conveys a threat or is grossly offensive for the purpose of causing distress or anxiety, and later pleaded guilty at Leeds Magistrates’ Court.As part of his sentence, Innes must also complete 25 rehabilitation days and pay a £300 fine.
