More than 20 swans have been rescued from a river following an oil spill.Berkshire-based Swan Support was first alerted to the birds wading in "thick, black oil" in the River Kennet, in Reading, on 16 July.Wendy Hermon, who has worked with the charity for 30 years, said it was a regular feeding area for more than 40 birds, and oil spills were now an "annual occurrence".Thames Water described it as a "third party spill" and said it had worked with the Environment Agency (EA) to place booms on the river to "minimise impact to wildlife in the area".
A Thames Water spokesperson said: “We were made aware of a third party oil spill on Cholmeley Road on Tuesday 16 July, which spilt into our surface water pipes and into the River Kennet."They added: "We have also carried out a clean-up of our pipework and are carrying out regular testing of our surface water sewer on this street.”The EA assisted Thames Water at the scene on Sunday and Monday.
Ms Hermon said it was "very frustrating and upsetting to have to deal with this especially as it could have been avoided".She said the birds got distressed when they were removed from the water and cleaned but it was necessary for their safety.Oil removes a bird's natural waterproofing and can cause them to sink in the water."Unfortunately this is a common occurrence in this area and would be better if the response times from the the EA was quicker as this may have stopped it getting worse," Ms Hermon said.A spokesperson for the EA said: “Our specialist officers attended the incident of oil pollution on the River Kennet in Reading and have been working with Thames Water to intercept any further oil discharge and reduce impacts.“We are also investigating the source of the oil that has entered the drainage system leading to the river."
