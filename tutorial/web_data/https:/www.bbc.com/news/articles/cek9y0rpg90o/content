Two sections of the A4 are due to be closed to upgrade pedestrian crossings.The High Street in Box will be closed between 22 and 26 July, followed by localised diversions on the A4 London Road for five weeks from 12 August.The work, divided into two phases, will involve the installing of a puffin signal and new bus shelter, refurbishing another zebra crossing and upgrading street furniture.Wiltshire Council has described the work as "essential" to ensure the pedestrian crossings are "safer for road users".
The first phase will involve the replacement of the zebra crossing near the High Street to a puffin signal-controlled crossing. It will aim to address concerns raised by nearby Box Primary School and reduce "pedestrian-vehicle conflicts" as well as encourage sustainable journeys to the school.Work is expected to last for three weeks, which includes a closure for five days and then temporary crossings and two-way traffic signals after.
On completion of the High Street crossing, the second phase of work near London Road will commence, to refurbish the existing zebra crossing, install a new bus shelter and upgrade street furniture.This project is expected to run from Monday 12 August. There will be no access to the road from Mill Lane or Bulls Lane during this phase of work and localised diversions and traffic management measures will be in place.Wiltshire Council's cabinet member for highways, Nick Holder, said: "Box Primary School has expressed concerns about the safety of their pupils with the current layout and the crossing at London Road has been in place for a number of years and is in need of upgrading.â€œWe apologise in advance for any inconvenience or delays caused by these works, but it is essential to refurbish and upgrade these pedestrian crossings, making them both safer for all road users."
