People have been asked to donate blood to help boost stock levels at a centre. NHS Blood and Transplant Service appealed to help fill available blood donation appointments at its Birmingham Donor Centre in New Street over the coming days and weeks. "There is a particular need for O negative and O positive donors," a spokesperson for the service said. "By giving an hour of your time, you could save up to three lives."  Appointments can be made on the NHS Blood and Transplant Service's website or by calling the service on 0300 123 23 23.
Nationally the service said it aimed to maintain a regular supply of all blood types to ensure the right blood is available to everyone who needs it. It is to meet day-today patient needs and to cope with emergencies.
