The leader of Gloucestershire County Council has announced he is standing down after 14 years.Conservative Mark Hawthorne announced on Wednesday he would no longer hold the top job at Shire Hall after the council meeting in September.The Quedgeley division councillor highlighted the Javelin Park incinerator and securing the A417 Missing Link as his proudest achievements, after he was first elected to the council to represent Moreland in 2009.Mr Hawthorne, 49, will continue to represent his constituents and possibly take on a cabinet position for the remainder of the current council, but he will not seek re-election at next year’s county council election.
Addressing the council on Wednesday morning, Mr Hawthorne said it had been "a huge privilege to serve the county, a community I've proudly called home"."I had the pleasure of working with some amazing colleagues across the political spectrum, that share a passion for our county," he said."We've invested over £250m extra into our roads over the last ten years, we've secured the biggest infrastructure pipeline for a generation, including finally getting started on the A417 Missing Link."We've invested in green infrastructure, from EV charger points to solar panels on our schools, and our decision to build Javelin Park has meant £24m worth of investment in frontline services when other councils have had to deliver cuts."Mr Hawthorne said some of his proudest moments in the job have been seeing the hard work of his "dedicated colleagues and amazing staff" pay off."As I look back over 14 years, I hope I played a small part in helping Gloucestershire find this ambition, helping it punch above its weight," he said."It has been a huge honour to serve the community I know, and, while I step back as leader, I will forever be a cheerleader for our glorious Gloucestershire."
A former St Peter's High School student, Mr Hawthorne later studied politics and economics at Liverpool John Moores University, where he was a Young Conservative.He returned to Gloucester in 1996, working for BT and later Cheltenham & Gloucester in Barnwood, where he worked his way up to become a HR project manager.Mr Hawthorne was appointed cabinet member for environment in 2009 by then-leader Barry Dare, before being elected to run the authority 12 months later, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.He had previously served as Gloucester City Council leader between 2004 and 2007.The new group leader will not automatically become leader of the council – that appointment will be voted on by all 53 Gloucestershire county councillors at their September meeting.
