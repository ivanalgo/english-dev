The National Grid wants to create a new 60km (37 mile) route of electricity pylons across Derbyshire. It would link a new substation in Chesterfield with an existing one in Willington in South Derbyshire.The overhead lines would carry six gigawatts of electricity - enough to power six million homes, said the company.An eight-week public consultation starts on Tuesday for the project that is designed to help harness the energy generated from offshore windfarms.
Project Manager Leanne Evans said: "The Chesterfield to Willington project is one of 17 projects that's happening across the country."We are expecting electricity demand to double over the coming years and we are seeing an increase in electricity generation, largely in offshore wind turbines and we need to be able to get that energy from where it is generated to where it is needed."The National Grid said that its infrastructure was largely built in the 1960s and needed upgrading.It said existing power lines did not have capacity to cope with the increased power flows from offshore wind turbines.
Over the next two months there will be a series of public consultation events in village halls and community centres across the county.Ms Evans added: "We recognise the concern that communities will have in hosting this type of infrastructure."We are very much in the early development stages of this project so we would really encourage people to come out, learn more about the proposals and give us that feedback and help us shape our proposals."Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
