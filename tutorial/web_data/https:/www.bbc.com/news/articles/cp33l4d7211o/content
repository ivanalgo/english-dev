Football fans in Jude Bellingham's hometown of Stourbridge in the West Midlands "went crazy" when the 20-year-old scored England's first goal of the 2024 Euros.A local brewery, the Green Duck Beer Co, hosted a packed out screening of the England v Serbia match on Sunday.Bellingham put the ball in the back of the net in the 13th minute, which was the only goal of the match."He's one of the best players in the world so to know he comes from Stourbridge is crazy," said taproom owner Alex Hill. 
He'd promised a free pint to all customers in attendance at a match where Bellingham scored and was surprised to have to hand out more than 100 tokens on Sunday night."I was quite surprised because it was a Sunday, but it was really busy," Mr Hill said."People went crazy when he scored, they absolutely loved it. Of course it was within the first 15 minutes. "I thought, 'oh, come on.'"But I'm really happy. It was hilarious."
The tokens will be valid for the taproom's next screening of England's match against Slovenia on 25 June.The brewery cannot host a screening as England take on Denmark on Thursday due to a pre-booked function."We couldn't believe it when we saw it," Mr Hill said. "We have a private booking for Thursday for a wedding party which was booked two or three years ago."
Bellingham, who plays for Real Madrid, is the first European player to make an appearance at three major international tournaments before turning 21.Speaking of his stratospheric rise, Mr Hill said: "It's amazing isn't it. A couple of my other directors their sons have played with his brother so they know his dad."I'm sure everybody tries to make a link with him."
