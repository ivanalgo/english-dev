A Leeds hospital has been awarded a £200,000 grant to create a new garden for patients and staff.Chapel Allerton Hospital will use the greener communities fund money to transform a courtyard within its rehabilitation area, Leeds Hospitals Charity said.The project would help patients and staff to "reconnect with nature", it added.The garden could also be used to deliver horticultural therapy to assist with patient recovery.
Becky Baldaro-Booth, head of grants at the charity, said: “Many of these patients will spend many weeks or months in hospital, so having a dedicated space outside clinical areas where they can enjoy nature is hugely important for both their physical and mental wellbeing."Patients will be able to take part in therapy sessions with staff, have a quiet space to reflect away from the ward or somewhere to sit outside with their friends and families."The new garden is expected to benefit up to 500 people, the charity added. 
The fund, which is in its second year, is a partnership between environmental charity Hubbub and NHS Charities Together and funded by a Starbucks 5p cup charge.Ellie Orton, NHS Charities Together chief executive, said: “One of our main objectives as a charity is to help improve the health of our nation and in turn reduce the pressure on overstretched NHS services."We look forward to working with the team at Leeds Hospitals Charity to bring to life their visions and see the significant impact that these green spaces will have on staff, patients and local communities alike.”Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
