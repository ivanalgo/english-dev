A weight limit zone to stop HGV’s going through several small villages in north Lincolnshire is being made permanent.A trial has been in place since 2022 which stopped vehicles heavier than 7.5 tonnes from travelling through one council ward.Ferry ward councillor Richard Hannigan said the trial had been “successful beyond our expectations” and had improved the quality of life for residents.The Ferry ward area weight zone covers Ulceby, Kirmington, Thornton Curtis, Burnham, Croxton and Wootton.
Following feedback from Humberside Police, vehicles exceeding the weight limit will be allowed through if there are diversion routes, road closures or roadworks.The Road Haulage Association (RHA) , which represents companies who operate HGVs, had objected to the traffic order.The RHA argued alternative routes would cost more and have a negative environmental impact due to increased journey times.However, councillors said that the trial had resulted in improved quality of life for residents, and there had been positive feedback from the police.The scheme came about following concerns raised by Ulceby Road Safety Group, Ulceby Parish Council and Ferry ward councillors.Stuart Smith of the Ulceby Road Safety Group said the decision was “absolutely fantastic" and said it "should have been done years ago”.Mr Hannigan told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: “It’s been successful beyond our expectations, really."It was a long old campaign to get it done, and we got there.”Goxhill is another village looking for solutions to HGV traffic, Mr Hannigan said.“We’re not going to give up on that one, we’ll keep at it,” he added.Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
