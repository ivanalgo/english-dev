A new development of homes for people who have been homeless has opened in a Cornish town.The 18 purpose-built modular homes are sited on part of the Tregunnel Hill car park in Newquay.The homes were intended to help people who had previously been homeless who were ready to move on from emergency accommodation in hotels, Cornwall Council said.The first modular development was built in Truro and two more were under construction in Penzance and Penryn, it added.
The houses are single-storey self-contained homes, with a kitchen, living and dining area, bedroom and bathroom.Olly Monk, council portfolio holder for housing, said the modular properties would "provide excellent quality accommodation for single people who would otherwise be homeless". He said: "It means that we have a stock of good quality homes that people can live in for a short period on dedicated sites, whilst they get the help and support they need to secure a permanent home."The council said there were currently more than 800 households living in temporary or emergency accommodation across Cornwall.Of these, nearly 100 people were in Newquay alone, so this scheme would help about 20% of those, the council added. 
A new resident of the development, who did not wish to be named, said: “I come from this area, and I’ve lived here my whole life - this is the place I call home. "Now I have a proper home and it’s my time to prove to myself – not to anyone else – that I can do it.”
