Plans for three hot food takeaway outlets in a shopping centre in Hull have been submitted.The planning application for units 62, 63 and 64 at Prospect Shopping Centre have been submitted to Hull City Council.The units are all currently advertised as "to let" by the shopping centre.The application includes outside alterations to the upper storeys at the corner of Prospect Street and Brook Street to allow extra windows to be installed.
Earlier this month the council said it had awarded almost £160,000 of Levelling Up Funding to create a space-themed attraction at the disused former food court on the top floor of the shopping centre.It is expected the Little Astronauts play area will create just about 14 full-time jobs, the council said.Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
