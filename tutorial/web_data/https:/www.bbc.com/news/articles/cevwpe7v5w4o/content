A former hair salon in Grimsby town centre could be turned into a centre for domestic abuse support services.North East Lincolnshire Women's Aid has applied for planning permission to change the use of a Grade II-listed building on Wellowgate into offices.If approved, it would see the property - formerly a salon - become home to ten full-time employees.The building would not be used as a refuge but instead offer support services.
As part of the development, the property would be redecorated, have new windows fitted, CCTV installed, and its roof replaced.According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Women's Aid would not be the only organisation to use the site.The building dates back to about 1800 and was awarded listed status in 1999 as one of the town centreâ€™s oldest remaining properties.The application states the proposals offered a "viable new use for a heritage asset" and the alterations would help to preserve the building and restore its "historic character".Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
