A mountain rescue team stepped in to save a stricken lamb stuck above deep water in Derbyshire.A request for assistance was made to Edale Mountain Rescue at about 10:25 BST on Wednesday, to help the worried animal stuck near a "vertical and loose slope" in the Edale Valley.Rescuers entered the water and reached the lamb before it was placed inside a secure bag and hoisted up to the bridge above.The mountain rescue team said the lamb's mother was "quite unaware" of where it had been for the last eight hours.
A team leader went along to the scene with a water rescue technician to carry out a risk assessment prior to collecting the lamb.While the rescue team were collecting kit to save the animal, another incident came through at Win Hill, which they had to attend to first.Team members then returned to the lamb and reassessed the situation as it had managed to get into a "more awkward spot than before".After some "aggressive swimming techniques", rescuers managed to get to the lamb to save it. In a social media post, the rescue team said: "No team members were hurt in this incident and baaaaa any complaints from the lamb, all ended well with a very happy farmer."
