A 15-year-old girl has qualified for a major junior darts competition.Lexi-Jayne Rooksby from Rushden, Northamptonshire, will play in the JDC World Youth Championship in Gibraltar in November.Nicknamed "The Knockout", Rooksby only took up playing the sport two years ago as a favour to her dad because his pub team were "short of players.""I am [pleased to qualify], I didn't think I was going to get as far as I did," she said. 
Rooksby has played at county level and has come up against other Northamptonshire professionals including Kettering's "Rapid" Ricky Evans and father and son duo James and Josh Richardson - also from Rushden.By her own admission, Rooksby said she "doesn't practise much" and never practised at home.Speaking about her chances at the upcoming tournament, Rooskby said: "I hope I do well, but there's going to be good people there. I'll try my best."
Rooksby's father Mick Rooksby said he was "really proud" of what she had achieved.Mr Rooksby added: "When she first started playing, there was no inkling to what she was going to be like, so when she qualified, there were a few tears. "To only do [minimum practice] and be as good as she is - you don't really hear those kind of stories."Darts has had a surge in popularity after Luke Littler became the youngest player to reach the PDC World Darts Championship final, at the age of just 16, in December 2023.
