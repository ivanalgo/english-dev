Footage has been released of a sailor onboard a damaged yacht who was saved in a two-day operation off Cornwall during Storm Ciaran.The yacht's mast broke and the vessel started taking on water when it was about 600 nautical miles out in the Atlantic Ocean.A beacon alert was received by HM Coastguard at about 11:30 GMT on 2 November. The first-responding vessel arrived at 15:00 the following day.
Support from the RAF, French air assets and other vessels led to the sailor and vessel being located by aircraft on the evening of 2 November. Multiple aircrafts were sent to maintain a constant orbit.The sailor was later rescued by the first-responding vessel and taken to a place of safety. Tom Barnett, HM Coastguard network commander, said had the vessel not been "kitted out correctly and had agencies not worked so well as a team, the result of the mission could have been very different".  He said: “This sailor had an emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) and knew how to use their VHF radio, which kept us updated on their location and health...“We are always ready to respond to anyone in need, in an emergency call 999 and ask for the Coastguard.”
