A scouting group in Lincolnshire may be forced to close because of a shortage of volunteers.Rob Johnson, of Boston District Scouts, said the people he would usually see volunteering were instead having to work more because of a "financial crush”.The 43-year-old said the situation was becoming a "big strain" on existing volunteers and "simply can’t be sustained”.A spokesperson for the Scouts said volunteer numbers had increased by 3% across Lincolnshire, but were not keeping pace with the number of young people wanting to join.
Mr Johnson, the lead volunteer for Boston District, said existing volunteers were "giving everything to scouting", but if nothing is done “groups will end up folding".According to the organisation, scouting groups across Boston are already at risk of closure and two have merged due to a lack of volunteers.
"We appreciate there is a hardship around finances at the moment," Mr Johnson added.He believes the group "gives young people a chance to socialise"."It’s not just camping and tying knots,” he said. “We teach young people important skills they can carry forward with them into their life."A spokesperson for the Scouts said: “In the last year volunteer numbers in Lincolnshire grew by just over 3%."But this did not keep pace with the number of young people wanting to join, which is why local scout groups are reaching out and asking for support".Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
