Clinical staff at Nottingham's hospitals have been given hundreds of bodyworn cameras in a bid to protect them from abuse.An additional 220 cameras have been introduced across Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust.The cameras will only be switched on when an individual is being violent or abusive, and after they have been told they will be recorded, the trust said.They have been introduced following a rise in violent incidents against staff since the start of the pandemic.
Lorraine Pell, deputy sister in the emergency department at the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC), says it is an "incredibly volatile job".She added: "If someone is aggressive and they know the camera is going to be switched on, they take a step back."Sometimes it's not their fault, but we have to protect ourselves. We just want to do our job and help people."Deputy charge nurse Hannah Freer, who works in the same department at the QMC, said: "Whilst at work, Iâ€™ve been called many insulting names, and even received death threats. "I've seen staff be assaulted, be punched, kicked and spat at. It's just not acceptable and needs to stop."The trust says the number of reported incidents against staff has increased by 35% over a 12-month period.
Dr Keith Girling, the trust's medical director, said: "We encourage our staff to always report these incidents and we will support prosecutions against anyone found guilty of abusing our staff in any way whilst they are at work." Nottinghamshire Police supports the use of the cameras.Supt Heather Maelor said: "As a force we have seen the deterrent effect these devices can have in preventing aggressive or violent behaviour."
