Work to turn a derelict cinema in Hull, which was bombed during World War Two, into a national memorial and community events area has started.The National Picture Theatre on Beverley Road was badly damaged during a German air raid in 1941.Work to stabilise the remaining structure took place in 2020 and the latest part of project will see the replacement of windows, new lighting and work on the facade.Hull City Council said it hoped the work would be complete by December.
Councillor Rob Prichard, portfolio holder for culture, said he was "delighted" to see the work get underway.He said: "Once complete it will, for the first time since it was destroyed, enable visitors to access the building safely."There are so many stories within the National Picture Theatre that are of national importance, and to have the opportunity to give it the attention it deserves is fantastic."
Work at the site has already uncovered several artefacts, which have been buried under the rubble since the bombing 83 years ago.They include tiles, shoes, bottles and ornamental mouldings.Hilary Byers, from the National Civilian WW2 Memorial Trust, which has campaigned and fundraised for the restoration, said the latest development is "brilliant".She said: "It has been so long to get to this point, but it's wonderful to see the scaffolding go up and the workers on site."
The cinema, which was designed by architects Runton and Barry and built in 1914, was hit during a raid on 18 March 1941.At the time, more than 150 people were inside, but no-one was killed or seriously injured.The council said the cinema was the "last surviving civilian bomb-damaged building" from the period.The authority added Hull was one of the worst-affected cities in the country during the Blitz and had to face air raids for longer than any other place in Britain.Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
