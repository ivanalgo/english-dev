A Nottinghamshire hospital at the centre of a patient death case, which had been rated inadequate, has been upgraded.Priory Hospital Arnold faced criticism after the death of Helen Tarry who died after leaving via a security door in December 2022.In June 2023 it was ordered to improve or face closure after care standards were found to be "totally unacceptable".But after fresh inspections, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) has rated it as "good", citing "significant improvements".
The privately-run hospital is an inpatient acute and psychiatric intensive care unit for up to 52 males and females with a wide range of mental health conditions.The previous inspection, prompted by the death of Ms Tarry, found half of nursing and support staff posts were vacant.It also identified issues with "staff training, restrictive practice, ineffective information systems and managing items which may present a risk to people".But following fresh checks, CQC inspectors wrote: "Patients told us they felt safe and supported on the ward and staff treated them with dignity and respect."
They also said: "Staff were visible and available to them on the ward and patients found staff to be helpful and approachable.""Managers implemented action plans, strategies and processes which had worked well and had improved the overall governance of the service. "We found the provider had implemented processes, which were evidence-based and measurable with outcomes being used to further improve the service and what it offered."Lucy Stupple, Priory Hospital Arnold hospital's director, said: â€œWe are proud to see the quality of service our patients receive is being recognised by the CQC. "We will continue to work with our partners and commissioners in the NHS and local authorities, to provide specialist care and treatment, and will continue to strive to further develop the service with our patients and their families."Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
