Environmental protesters sat on toilets on a busy Thames footbridge to highlight the issue of sewage being released into waterways.Extinction Rebellion activists took their campaign, and toilets, to Christchurch Bridge in Reading on Saturday.The group said it wanted to "draw further attention to the continuing release of sewage into the River Thames by Thames Water".Thames Water, which has its headquarters nearby, said the sewage system "was historically designed to work in this way".
The protest is part of the Extinction Rebellion's Don't Pay for Dirty Water campaign.Molly, one of the activists, said: "We're here to draw attention to the fact that water companies are not making our waters safe."Our rivers are in a state of decline and this has got to stop."A Thames Water statement said: "While all discharges are unacceptable, the sewage system was historically designed to work in this way, to prevent sewage backing up into people’s homes."We have published plans to upgrade 250 of our sites across the region."More investment is needed across the entire sector, as infrastructure ages and demand on it increases."
