Hedgehogs, frogs and slow worms could face a "massacre" as 'No-Mow May' comes to an end, keen gardeners have been warned. Forest of Dean councillor Alan Preest warned residents to take care and asked for the council to issue advice on the best way to tackle mowing. Gardeners have been encouraged throughout May to let lawns grow wild in a bid to promote biodiversity. Mr Preest warned with "deafening sounds of mowers and strimmers imminent", people should be aware of species that have made the undergrowth their home. 
While the no-mow scheme helps improve habitats for bees and other insects, there are fears frogs, slow worms, mice and hedgehogs could be killed. Mr Preest asked a full council meeting: "Could residents be reminded before the cut begins to either try to disturb the grass a little, or commence the cut from the centre rather than the edge.“Then the creatures will have a fighting chance of escaping a potential post-no-mow May mower massacre.”
The Local Democracy Reporting Service reported deputy leader Andy Moore said the council will take on board his advice.“It will go in the guidance,” he said.The no-mow May campaign was started by conservation charity Plantlife in 2019 to encourage gardeners to let wildflowers grow. The UK has reportedly lost 97% of its wildflower meadows since the 1930s. Wildflower meadows are a vital source of food for pollinators such as butterflies and bees.
