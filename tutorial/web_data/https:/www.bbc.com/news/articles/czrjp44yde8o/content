Some businesses have expressed concerns over plans to pedestrianise a market square.Parking spaces would be removed from the square in Cleethorpes as part of an £18m redevelopment of the seaside resort.North East Lincolnshire Council leader Philip Jackson said the authority was "talking to businesses and traders as the plans progress".Beauty salon owner Aggie Singh said she was thinking about moving from the market place.
"I've been here for about five years, invested quite a lot in my business," she said."It's picking up really well. I can't see the area being without the parking here."Ms Singh added: "I'm all about the innovation here, but the negative effects on the local community hasn't been discussed or considered at all."Emma Lane, who runs a recently opened cafe, said she was worried about the impact the building work would have on trade."That's going to affect us," she said."All the business is going to slow down, so I can't afford to wait six months, nine months."I don't have that kind of money. We've put everything we have into our business now and with the summer and everything else, we hope to push forward."
The scheme received £18m in Levelling Up funding and a master plan by designer Wayne Hemingway would also see the promenade and Pier Gardens transformed.According to the council's website, the Market Square would become "a flexible space for market and pop events to energise the area and support local businesses".It would also have public seating and tables for for cafes and restaurants. Mr Jackson told BBC Radio Humberside he was "confident that businesses will benefit, but we do have to listen to their concerns.""We think actually removing car parking from the square will mean that a lot more people will use it and it will become a way of connecting the seafront with St Peter’s Avenue which is the main shopping area," he said.Mr Jackson added that as part of the plans there would be additional car parking in the area around the square.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
