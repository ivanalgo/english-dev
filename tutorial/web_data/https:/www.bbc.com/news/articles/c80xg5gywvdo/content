Drivers are being advised to find alternative routes as road and lane closures are planned ahead of a £285,000 highway improvement scheme starting this week.Work will include resurfacing the A525 Higherland in Newcastle-under-Lyme and repairing damaged kerbs and drainage, which is expected to take six weeks to complete. The renovation, carried out by Staffordshire County Council is part of a wider £50m, three-year project to improve the county’s roads.The council said the well-used section of the road was in need of an upgrade and thanked people in advance for their patience.
Temporary traffic lights will also be in place while the scheme takes place to make sure "the work can be carried out safely and to minimise disruption", the authority said.Overnight closures from 20:00 to 06:00 BST from 5-7 August will be in place for resurfacing.
