A man suspected of killing three women in the same family with a crossbow has yet to be questioned by detectives.Carol Hunt, 61, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, died at their home in Bushey, Hertfordshire, on Tuesday evening.Kyle Clifford, 26, from north London, was found wounded in Enfield after a manhunt on Wednesday. He was arrested on Thursday evening on suspicion of three counts of murder.Investigators said they must wait for medical staff to confirm that Mr Clifford, who is in a serious condition in hospital, is well enough to be spoken to before questioning can begin.
Hertfordshire Police said although there was usually a time limit to question arrested suspects, it did not apply in this case.The force said because Mr Clifford was in hospital, "the custody clock has not yet started".Police can typically hold suspects for 24 hours in custody, or longer for the most serious offences.
The three women killed were the wife and two daughters of BBC commentator, John Hunt.Paying tribute on Saturday, Mr Hunt and his third daughter, Amy, said: "The devastation that we are experiencing cannot be put into words."
