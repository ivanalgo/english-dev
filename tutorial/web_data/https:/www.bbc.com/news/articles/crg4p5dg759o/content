Nearly £50m of money earmarked for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) is at risk.In a report being presented to Cambridgeshire County Council on Tuesday, its internal auditors say the authority hasn't been able to meet an agreement to save money.The money was awarded to provide more spaces for SEND children in the county. At the time, the council had a funding gap of £58m.The council said it was renegotiating its agreement with the Department for Education (DfE). 
The original agreement said the council should make a contribution of £9m over five years to reduce a deficit in its funding in return for receiving £49m to pay for more SEND spaces.The auditors say they have found "limited assurance" that the programme will be able to meet the conditions of the agreement.The audit has also spotted issues with "data quality that inhibited forecasting and financial modelling".The report says the council has overspent by £14.6m due to high levels of demand. Overspending goes against the agreement with the DfE.A council spokesperson said it was currently "in the process of renegotiating" the agreement because of the "continuing significant increase in demand for Education, Health and Care Plans".The report also says the demand is having a knock-on effect on home-to-school transport.
