Workers at three hospitals in Surrey and West Sussex have begun a second period of industrial action.More than 350 staff at Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust are taking part in the strikes, on Thursday and Friday, in a dispute over back pay, after the trust offered to change their salary band.Members of the Unison union at East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, Crawley Hospital and Horsham Hospital said they have been carrying out work beyond their pay grade for years.A spokesperson for Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust said while it respected "their right to strike" it was "disappointed" that the pay offer had not been accepted and that the action was taking place "whilst the grievance process is ongoing".
The union said that 98% of nursing assistants backed strike action in a formal ballot.They added the trust has acknowledged that staff are undertaking additional work they are not being paid for and said it has refused to compensate them properly for the years spent working above their pay grade. In similar banding disputes elsewhere, trusts have agreed to recognise employees’ extra work as far back as August 2018.Unison South East regional organiser Rachel Slaughter said: “These dedicated workers provide incredible care for patients, over and above their job description. They’ve done this for years because they’re proud of the work they do. But the trust has been getting it on the cheap.“Staff have seen others in a similar position across the country recognised for their extra work and mustn’t be left behind."The trust spokesperson added: “As a trust we value our nursing assistants and maternity support workers and the work they do every day for our patients. “We are working closely with those members of staff and their union to find a resolution as soon as possible.”
