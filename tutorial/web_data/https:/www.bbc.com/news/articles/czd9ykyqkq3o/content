The parents of a young woman who killed herself after suffering domestic abuse are calling for coroners to have more understanding of the impact of coercive control.Roisin Hunter Bennett's suicide was initially attributed by a coroner to the "ending of a relationship" and "pressure of balancing work and studying for exams".The 19-year-old's parents from Darlington successfully appealed to the High Court for the inquest conclusion to be amended, with the coroner adding she took her own life "due to an emotionally abusive relationship".Miss Hunter Bennett's former partner denies any wrongdoing.
The teenager died in hospital on 16 March 2022, nine days after trying to take her own life.Her parents, Margaret Hunter and Tony Bennett, said her two-year relationship, which ended shortly before her death, had been emotionally abusive.At her inquest in January 2023, County Durham and Darlington assistant coroner James Thompson concluded Miss Hunter Bennett had taken her own life "due to the ending of a relationship and the pressure of balancing work and studying for exams".

Her parents strongly felt that did not reflect the reality of their daughter's mental state prior to her death and claimed emotional abuse and coercive control contributed to her suicide.They said there were 60,000 texts and social media messages exchanged between Miss Hunter Bennett and her ex-boyfriend in the two years before she died, however the inquest only considered exchanges from the 48 hours before her suicide attempt.
Ms Hunter said: "For anyone who knows anything about coercive and controlling behaviour, that in itself shows a fundamental misunderstanding. "Coercive and controlling behaviour is a pattern of behaviour which occurs over a long period of time."The coroner said that he could not apportion blame. It was important to be proportionate, but if there is an overwhelming amount of evidence in one particular area, then that is just where the evidence is."They sought a judicial review and received pro bono legal advice, for which they were very grateful.Miss Hunter Bennett's ex-partner was invited to both the inquest and the judicial review but did not attend either.
In February 2024, following a successful judicial review, the coroner conceded he had made an error and amended his conclusion to read that Miss Hunter Bennett took her own life "due to an emotionally abusive relationship".Ms Hunter said: "I feel as though it is incumbent on the chief coroner who is in charge to urgently issue guidelines on domestic abuse-related suicide so that he can give his coroners some clarity."Mr Bennett added: "Guidance would help them to deal with the evidence of abuse without fear of seeming to stray from their narrow remit of where, when and how someone died."It would help them deal with the fact that they cannot be seen to apportion blame."The police told the inquest that there would be no criminal prosecution.Miss Hunter Bennett's ex-partner told the BBC: "Roisin's untimely death caused me great shock and sadness."While I regret things I said while upset following the breakdown of our relationship, in no way do I accept that I was emotionally abusive towards Roisin or caused her to take her own life."The BBC contacted the chief coroner for interview but they declined to comment.
