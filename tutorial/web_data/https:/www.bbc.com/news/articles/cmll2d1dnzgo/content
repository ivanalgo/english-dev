A hotel chain in Guernsey is giving guests the option to go without room service in exchange for donating money to an environmental charity.Sarnia Hotels said it had donated £1,300 to Trees for Life after contributing £2 per room per day over three months.Guests to the chain's three St Peter Port hotels are given a door handle sign to show housekeepers they have chosen not to have their room serviced.Karel Harris, the hotel's managing director, said many guests did not feel their rooms needed to be cleaned every day.
Ms Harris said: "I'm quite sure that not all of us clean every inch of our house each day."A lot of our guests feel the same way, they don't need to have it serviced daily."Andy McCutcheon, from Trees for Life, said it was a "significant donation" that would help replace trees lost during storms."Storm events are not unusual here in Guernsey, but we think in future those storm events will become more frequent and more severe," he said."It becomes even more important to plant trees when we can to act as replacements."Hundreds of trees were lost when Storm Ciaran battered the Channel Islands in November 2023.
