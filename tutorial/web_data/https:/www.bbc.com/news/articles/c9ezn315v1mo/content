A man killed himself one day after being charged with an offence relating to a previous suicide attempt, an inquest has heard.Cameron Edwards, 24, from Buckley, Flintshire, died in April last year when he crashed his motorbike into a wall in Mold.Earlier that day, he had appeared in magistrates’ court charged with obstructing a public highway after being found sitting on a bridge over the A483 in Wrexham.An inquest in Ruthin on Thursday concluded his death was a suicide.
Coroner Kate Robertson read a statement from Mr Edwards’ father, Robin, who said his son suffered with mental health issues and had been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder.He had "multiple admissions" to the Heddfan psychiatric unit at Wrexham Maelor Hospital and two to the Ablett Unit at Glan Clwyd Hospital.The inquest heard how, in 2021, one of Mr Edwards' dogs bit a child and he was facing prosecution for this.
A report from Betsi Cadawaladr health board added he had "struggled to cope with the prospect of losing his dogs" and "felt he would be sent to prison and his dogs would be destroyed".Before a court hearing in March 2022, he took an overdose and could not attend.The health board said he had been admitted to hospital five times in the five months before his death but, despite collaborative working across departments, there was "no therapeutic role for hospital admission" and he was discharged.Then, on 6 April 2023, Mr Edwards was remanded into custody for his own safety after being found sitting on a bridge over the Berse slip road in Wrexham.Sgt Corey McLeod said Mr Edwards was charged with obstructing a public highway and there was fear "he may harm himself" if released.On 7 April, he was fined £110 in court and, later that day, rode a motorbike into the wall of Rhual Farm.He died from severe head injuries.The inquest heard there was no alcohol in his blood and only the prescribed level of anti-depressant medication.If you are affected by any of the issues in this article there are details of organisations that can help on the BBC Action Line page.
