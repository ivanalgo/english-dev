A man has denied murdering Chloe Mitchell in Ballymena last summer.Ms Mitchell's remains were found eight days after she went missing in June 2023.Brandon Rainey, 27, of James Street in the town, appeared at Belfast Crown Court on Friday charged with murder and attempting to prevent the burial of the 21-year-old's body.When he was asked to enter a plea, he replied “not guilty" to both charges.
A defence lawyer told the court that the defendant has a long history of mental health illness and his “state of mind" at the time of his alleged involvement in the case will be a “primary focus” in his defence.The case was adjourned until September to allow a consultant psychiatrist to compile a report.
Last June, an extensive search for Chloe Mitchell had been launched around the town, including along the river Braid, but the search ultimately focused on an area around a house where the young woman was last seen alive.Dozens of relatives and friends of the young victim were in the public gallery of the court for the brief hearing on Friday.They had travelled from Ballymena to Belfast on a coach and walked together to the entrance of Laganside Courthouse.They wore white "Justice for Chloe" t-shirts and carried photographs of the young victim as well as banners with the same message.
