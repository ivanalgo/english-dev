A couple who suffered two late miscarriages in one "very tough" year have vowed to plough their energy into "something positive" by raising money for charity. Krissi and Sam Nesbitt were given the news at their 12 week scan in February last year that their baby had no heartbeat. They fell pregnant with twins six months later but were told again that neither baby had a heartbeat. “Dealing with this the first time round was very tough but the second time felt like we had been hit by a bus," said Ms Nesbitt. 
The couple have been referred to the recurrent miscarriage unit at Epsom Hospital.To thank maternity staff who looked after them, they ran the Rome Marathon last weekend and have raised £2,200 for the Epsom and St Helier Hospitals Charity.Epsom hospital said the money could fund new medical equipment, improve facilities and train staff. Ms Nesbitt said: “We can’t thank the maternity teams enough.”She said they wanted to share their story so "others don't feel so alone". "Miscarriage is a subject that is not talked about enough - it is too often a hidden grief that has a massive impact on peoples lives," said Ms Nesbitt. Offering comfort to other affected couples, Ms Nesbitt said: “My biggest piece of advice is to be kind to yourself."
