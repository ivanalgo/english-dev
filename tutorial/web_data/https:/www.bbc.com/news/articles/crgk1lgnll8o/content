Repairs to a closed rail and road bridge in Kent are progressing well and should be finished on time at the weekend, according to Network Rail. Kingsferry Bridge, one of two bridges linking the Isle of Sheppey to mainland Kent, will reopen on Sunday after the latest eight-day closure.The work, spread over a period of weeks this summer, has been to allow engineers to replace steel cables and ropes on the 64-year-old structure which raise it for maritime traffic.Asta Neely, asset strategy manager at Network Rail, said the job was "incredibly challenging" but the team were "working incredibly hard".
She said: "We expect the ropes to last between 25 to 30 years so we have a good way to go before we need to do this again."The Sheppey Crossing road bridge has remained unaffected during the works. 
A Network Rail spokesperson said: "The repairs are needed after routine inspections revealed that the condition of some of the 40 steel ropes, which support the bridge when it lifts for maritime traffic, have deteriorated."The ropes were last replaced in 1995 and are reaching the end of their life, the spokesperson added. "While regular testing ensures bridge users are kept safe, if the rope condition worsens it could result in an unplanned closure which would cause significant disruption to bridge users until repairs are made."
The Kingsferry Bridge was built in the 1950s and is a rail, road, pedestrian and cycle link to Sheppey.It is also vital for the movement of billions of pounds worth of goods by ship each year.The Network Rail spokesperson said: "By doing the work in summer the risk of Sheppey Crossing, the alternative route to the island, closing due to high winds is also significantly reduced."Trains are not running between Sittingbourne and Sheerness while work is being carried out.A regular rail replacement bus service is running between Sheerness, Queenborough, Kemsley and Sittingbourne stations.
