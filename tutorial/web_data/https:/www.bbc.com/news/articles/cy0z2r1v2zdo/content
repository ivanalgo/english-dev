Police say they are taking a new approach to managing traffic on the north coast over Easter after admitting previous attempts may have made things worse and were considered unhelpful.Thousands descend on the coastal towns of Portrush and Portstewart each year at Easter.That poses a number of challenges including lengthy traffic delays, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said .In previous years officers actively managed traffic, but this year the force said it would instead direct people to car parks.Ch Insp Sinead McIldowney said police will be “reinvigorating" their approach.
“Previously our response was aimed at implementing a permanent traffic management plan with police deployed to static traffic points, and employing an external traffic consultant to advise us of same,” Ch Insp McIldowney said.“Whilst our intentions were in the best interests of the public, including local communities and road users, we acknowledge that our efforts were considered unhelpful and possibly exacerbated longer delays in Portrush and Portstewart areas”.Drivers have been warned to expect delays again this year.
Ch Insp McIldowney said the police's aim was to make the most possible use of car parks - which she said visitors would be directed to." [They] will be clearly signposted as visitors approach the Portrush and Portstewart areas," she said.A "blue lane" has also been in operation in previous years to facilitate emergency service vehicles. This will not be in place in 2024.Instead, Ch Insp McIldowney said, officers would assist as and when required.
The change of approach comes after a twelve month consultation with the community, police said.The PSNI said it also intend to clamp down on car cruises and other anti-social behaviour on the roads over the bank holiday.In 2022, 500 motorists were caught speeding  and 24 vehicles seized on the north coast over the Easter weekend.
