A devolution deal for Hull and the East Riding has been approved to be sent to the government.The plan, which would see an elected mayor for the region, will now be submitted to the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.A new Mayoral Combined Authority (MCA) could be in place by autumn 2024 if the Department for Levelling Up is satisfied.Hull and East Riding Unitary Leaders Board approved the proposal on 27 March.
During an eight-week consultation, over 5,800 people shared their views and feedback on the proposal, Hull City Council said.Both Hull City Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council would work together to establish a combined authority for the area.The new authority would get more than £13m a year to invest in the region.It would also have control over funding for housing, job creation and public transport, including bus franchising.Additional funding of around £25m would be invested in flood defences, public transport and to develop the local economy, the government said.
