An off-duty RNLI lifeguard saved two young bodyboarders after they got caught in a rip current and were at risk of being dragged out to sea.Callum McDonald, from Dundee, was surfing at Farr Bay near Thurso when he spotted the children in difficulty near rocks.The RNLI said that during the rescue the bodyboarders became tired and frightened, and struggled to keep themselves afloat after losing their boards.Mr McDonald got the children to hold a leash attached to his surf board and he managed to get them to shore in the incident on 5 July.
The lifeguard has spoken of the rescue to help raise awareness of World Drowning Prevention Day.Mr McDonald had been surfing for about an hour when he saw what he thought was another surfer.He said: "There was lots of splashing, and I realised it was them kicking their legs furiously in an attempt to get back to safety."They were moving in the rip at a reasonable speed – rip currents are fast moving channels of water flowing out to sea. "It is common for rip currents to form around fixed structures like the rocks at the end of sandy bays like Farr Bay."
Mr McDonald said the children were unable to swim to him.He added: "I was insistent on taking them one at a time to ensure their safety, but they were so scared and panicked that neither of them wanted to be left alone. "I decided that them holding onto the leash was the next best resort and began to paddle back."The children were reunited with their friends and family back on the beach.Mr McDonald warned the group of the potential risk of secondary drowning, which  is caused by water on lungs and can develop up to 48 hours later.One of the bodyboarders' parents, who asked to be called by her first name - Tracy - praised Mr McDonald's actions.She said: "If it wasn’t for Callum’s courageous actions, I don’t even want to think about what could have happened. "He is a hero, and we can’t thank him enough for how he responded that day."
