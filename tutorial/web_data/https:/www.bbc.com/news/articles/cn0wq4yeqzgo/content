Hundreds of bikers will take to the streets on Easter Sunday to deliver eggs to children in hospital.For the past decade, the event, organised by Durham Easter Egg Run, has seen bikers travel to Durham and Darlington hospitals, raising money for charity.People usually line the route to wave off the bikers, who are often in fancy dress.One of the organisers, Tony Hudspith, said: "It just gets bigger and better every time."
Mr Hudspith, 50, from Hartlepool, helped start the run.He said: "I just did a Facebook page expecting maybe 20 people to turn up, and there was about 350 people..."The atmosphere is brilliant at the start, there's people at the sides watching, and you can imagine the roar of the engines."
Organisers said they were hoping to gather more than 1,000 bikers for the 2024 run, including volunteer marshals who guide bikers along the route.
When the bikers arrive at the hospitals, they take the eggs up to the children's ward and the patients come down to see the bikes and people in fancy dress.Mr Hudspith said: "It's great just to see the smile on the kids' faces but, not only them, their parents are there as well, and they appreciate it, as well as the nurses."
A spokesperson for County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust said they were "grateful" to the bikers."Their kindness enhances both patient care and experience," they said.
People with buckets will also be out on the route this year raising money for the Great North Air Ambulance, Rainbow Trust, Miles for Men and Paws Up.
