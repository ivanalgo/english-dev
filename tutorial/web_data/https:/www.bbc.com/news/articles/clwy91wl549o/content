New ponds have been dug at a former quarry to create habitats for wildlife and rejuvenate the land.The Wrose Quarry Wetlands restoration project in Shipley, near Bradford, was funded by £70,000 in government Levelling Up grants.Volunteers have now excavated pools, installed new drainage and extended the pathway.More than 120 people spent several months undertaking the work.
The former brickworks site was "waterlogged" and difficult to access before the improvements.The Conservation Volunteers' project leader Col Powell said: "This has been an incredible project to work on and will be a sanctuary for people to visit, with incredible views."The new ponds and wetland features complement the existing habitats, opening up the site to a broad range of flora and fauna. "We've already had reports of a heron here, which is fantastic."
Councillor Alex Ross-Shaw, Bradford Council’s portfolio holder for regeneration, planning and transport, said: “This place has been transformed, from waterlogged paths to something special for the whole community to enjoy for many years to come.“It's the result of a lot of hard work from all the volunteers, business and community groups involved as well as the teams at the Towns Fund, and Bradford Council. "We've already had excellent feedback from people and we are so proud of what has been achieved here."The Shipley Towns Fund was set up as part of the Levelling Up programme under the last government.The Fund's chairman Adam Clerkin added: "We'd like to thank each and every person who has been involved with this transformation. "It's taken months of work and is a truly great result that we know will be enjoyed by all."Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
