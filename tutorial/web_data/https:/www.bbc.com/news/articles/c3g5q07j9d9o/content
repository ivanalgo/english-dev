Police have arrested two men over alleged breaches of Scotland's new fox hunting legislation.It follows video surveillance and complaints submitted by anti-hunt groups in the Scottish Borders.Officers have investigated six reports of illegal fox hunting since the new law was introduced in October.Police Scotland confirmed that two men aged 29 and 55 were arrested as part of its inquiries.
Introduced more than 20 years after the original fox hunting ban, Scotland's new legislation is aimed at closing loopholes in the law.The Hunting with Dogs (Scotland) Act 2023 imposed a two-dog pack limit for the management of wild mammals.Wellbeing minister Mairi McAllan, who piloted the legislation through parliament, said:  "The chasing and killing of a wild mammal with a dog, for sport, or otherwise, has no place in modern Scotland."It's been illegal for 20 years, but deficiencies in the previous legislation have led to concerns that it persists."This bill is about closing those loopholes, preventing others from opening and finally ending illegal hunting with dogs in Scotland."
Since the new law came into force, campaign groups have concentrated protests and "evidence-gathering" on several hunts in the Scottish Borders.Robbie Marsland, Scotland director of The League against Cruel Sports welcomed the arrests. He said: "I think the Scottish government has done a pretty good job with this legislation."The police are investigating anyone who wants to test the legislation and if they are believed to have breached it, they are being arrested."Many landowners and countryside organisations continue to argue for hunting to be used as a means of controlling predators around livestock.Nine hunts continue to operate in Scotland with several used for drag-hunting - where an artificial scent is laid by supporters as an alternative to traditional fox hunting.Mr Marsland hopes a meeting with the government later this month will lead to this also being banned.He added: "Ministers don't have to go back to parliament to ban drag-hunting."If they feel that it is being used as a smokescreen they can ban it as well."
A Police Scotland spokesperson said: "Since the introduction of the Hunting with Dogs Act in October 2023, we have investigated six reports of illegal fox hunting.“A 29 year-old man has been charged with three hunting offences and is the subject of a report to the procurator fiscal.“A second man, aged 55 years, was arrested following a report of three further hunting offences. He has been released pending further inquiry.”Several hunts were approached for comment.
