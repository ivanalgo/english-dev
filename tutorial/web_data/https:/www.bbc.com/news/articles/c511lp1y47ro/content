A nature group helped people foster a "deeper connection" with nature by creating plant displays during a repair cafe session in Jersey.Members of the horticultural Grouville Grows project were at the Grouville Repair Cafe in St Clement's Parish Hall on Saturday morning.During the event people were given the chance to create and take home plant installations.The project's leader, Sarah Howard, said seeds from the plants would be collected in the autumn to be used for future projects.
Ms Howard said: "This forward-thinking approach not only promotes environmental stewardship but also encourages islanders to cultivate their fruits and vegetables, fostering a deeper connection with nature throughout the summer months."People could take their own pots and containers or take from a range of recycled items to use in their plant installations."It's been really successful," Ms Howard said. "People have come and asked about the plants and were very interested in the wild native plants, also in the plants that we can eat."We're about improving biodiversity but also the soil, and when we improve the soil, anything we plant in there to eat will start to improve the biome in our guts, as well as the biome in the soil," she added.
