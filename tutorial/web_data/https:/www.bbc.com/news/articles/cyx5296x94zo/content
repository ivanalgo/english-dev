The prime minister has called on a Green MP to support plans for a massive pylon route across East Anglia.Earlier this month Waveney Valley MP Adrian Ramsay asked for a “pause” in the “controversial” 114-mile (184-km) scheme that could run from Norwich to Tilbury in Essex.Mr Ramsay said the infrastructure was needed, but other options should be considered, as the pylon proposal had stirred “huge local concern”.At Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, Sir Keir Starmer said it was “extraordinary” that Mr Ramsay was “opposing vital clean energy infrastructure”.
National Grid, a private firm, wants to build the power line to carry electricity generated by 50 gigawatts of offshore windfarms and has said the previous government had set a target of doing this by 2030.Apart from underground sections beneath the River Stour and Dedham Vale and at Great Horkesley in Essex, it will be carried on pylons.Mr Ramsay, who is the co-leader of the national Green Party, previously said: “There's huge local concern about the impact on agricultural land, on traffic, on local communities, on the landscape.“So what I'm arguing for is a pause while the other options are considered, because of course we need the infrastructure; it's a matter of doing it in the right way that has a long-term benefit."National Grid previously said it had carefully assessed several alternative options, and delaying the project would delay access to cleaner and more affordable electricity in East Anglia.
At his first PMQs, Mr Ramsay asked the prime minister to “show leadership personally” on the “existential issue" of nature depletion and biodiversity.Sir Keir said his government was “committed to nature recovery”, and then challenged Mr Ramsay about the pylon project."I would ask him to show some [leadership], because it is extraordinary that having been elected to this House as a Green politician, he is opposing vital clean energy infrastructure in his own constituency.“We will put the plans before this House. I ask him to back those plans,” the PM said.
In response to Mr Ramsay's call for the project to be paused, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: "Securing Britain's clean energy future requires improving outdated infrastructure to get renewable electricity on the grid and unleash its true potential."National Grid has put the Norwich to Tilbury proposals out for public consultation and like all infrastructure, these proposals would be subject to a rigorous planning permission process."
