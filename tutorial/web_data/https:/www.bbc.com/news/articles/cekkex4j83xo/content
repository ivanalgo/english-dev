Plans have been submitted to transform part of a former newspaper site into a centre for hairdressing and beauty boutiques. The Express & Star vacated its longstanding home on Queen Street in Wolverhampton city centre in December and moved into its new offices in Mander House.Plans have now been submitted by Sculpt design to convert part of the former print works into a centre for small businesses offering hairdressing and beauty services.The plans would also see the original Express & Star canteen be turned into a cafe while the first floor would be kept as office space.
In its planning statement, Sculpt design said: "The original use as an industrial building is no longer suitable for this city centre location. "These proposals will help to revitalise a currently neglected part of the city centre with spaces to support multiple new and expanding businesses."The previous class use is no longer relevant to the area and would be unlikely to be supported by the council if it were to be built today."
Stretching across Queen Street, Castle Street and Tower Street, the site comprises office space, the old press hall, and a multi-storey car park with 350 spaces.In January, it was also earmarked as a potential site for 145 houses by City of Wolverhampton Council, which estimated the plot could be developed between 2031 and 2036.The Express & Star moved out of the site six months after it was listed for sale with property firm Knight Frank.The move came shortly after the Express & Star and Shropshire Star were sold from the family-owned Claverley Group to National World.
