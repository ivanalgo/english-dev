Concerns have been raised about possible "limitations" regarding a new review into paedophile head teacher Neil Foden.    Cyngor Gwynedd's cabinet member for education Beca Brown said an independent child practice review might not be enough and a public inquiry could be needed.Foden, 66, from Old Colwyn in Conwy county, was jailed for 17 years on Monday after being found guilty of sexual abuse involving four girls over a four-year period. These included 12 counts of sexual activity with a child and two counts of sexual activity with a child while he was in a position of trust.
In an interview with Newyddion S4C, Llanrug councillor Beca Brown shared her concerns about the current review, which is being carried out by the North Wales Safeguarding Board. Although not part of a "criminal or investigative process" it is intended to "examine agencies' involvement and identify lessons to be learnt"."You can't force evidence or witnesses to take part, and people won't contribute under oath," said Ms Brown. "But I would expect everyone who is called to contribute will do that fully and be fully cooperative."She added more than one inquiry needed to be considered, "possibly a public one"."If the Welsh government or the children's commissioner felt the need for a further, wider investigation I would fully welcome that."
Jenny Williams, chair of the North Wales Safeguarding Board, said that the review is "an important opportunity to collate and analyse all the information".She added that the "report will highlight learning from the case, areas of good practice and recommendations to improve future safeguarding". Ms Williams described it as "a vital step in protecting vulnerable children in north Wales".Foden, who was head of one Gwynedd school and strategic head of another, was convicted in May of 19 charges in total.Sentencing him at Mold Crown Court, Judge Rhys Rowlands said he was "depraved", "arrogant" and a "bully".It emerged during his case that several people had raised concerns about Foden's closeness with one child in 2019.
The concerns raised were emailed to Gwynedd Council's then head of education Garem Jackson, a role he left for personal reasons shortly after Foden's arrest last September.He told the court he had passed them to a safeguarding officer but was told, as no specific allegations had been made, that no formal investigation would take place.Instead he was instructed to speak to Foden on the phone, reminding him to "keep an appropriate distance" from young people.He explained that Foden told him the concerns were "over-dramatic" and assured him there was nothing going on.He told the court no written record was made of these exchanges.At Foden's trial, the judge criticised the council's failure to investigate, calling it "very concerning"."I take his words with the utmost seriousness," said Beca Brown."I accept that the magnifying glass is going to be everywhere - it needs to be."There's nothing more important than getting to the bottom of what's happened here," she added, praising the victims "determination" and "resilience" in giving their evidence in court.In a statement Garem Jackson called safeguarding a "key priority" for him as head of education."In rare circumstances where concerns were raised directly with me I reported them to the appropriate officer whose advice I followed," he said, adding that he would cooperate fully with the independent review.The child practice review is expected to take around six months before being submitted to the Welsh government.
