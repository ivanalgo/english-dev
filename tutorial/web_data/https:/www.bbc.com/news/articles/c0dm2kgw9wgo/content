A group of patients have been the first to be transferred to a new mental health ward in Somerset. The NHS said it made the decision to move services from St Andrews in Wells to Yeovil due to the challenges of getting patients to an emergency department when required.The new ward, named Rowan 2, has 15 in-patient beds with a round-the-clock mental health team.Staff will care for those with acute mental health needs and a range of community-based mental health services will also be offered.
The new ward is one of four in Somerset - with two in Yeovil and two in Taunton.It is located next to the existing Rowan 1 ward, which has been refurbished.
Hazel Armstrong, clinical services manager for both Rowan wards said: "We know that it isn't an easy move for some of our patients and their loved ones, and our teams will be on hand to welcome and support our patients in their transition on to the new ward. "We are very mindful about the potential impact of this move, and we will continue to work alongside people that matter for our patients, and maintain the close links that we have with local mental health services in Mendip".
