A person who stole the notes of comedian Dara Ó Briain after a gig in Guernsey has apologised and made a donation, the venue has said. The Irish stand-up took to social media to detail how his notes were stolen from the stage at St James after his performance on 19 July. Venue staff found the culprit on CCTV, who happened to have invited Ó Briain for a drink after the show, where he was able to meet them and retrieve his notes. St James' manager Jon Bisson said the culprit was "heartbroken" by the "misunderstanding" and made a donation to the charity which ran the venue. 
"Dara was able to get them back within an hour," said Mr Bisson. It was a "misunderstanding" more than anything else, as "they thought of it like taking a setlist," he said. He added that the comedian would probably use the experience for future material.
Ó Briain took to social media to reveal the detective work that went into tracking down the culprit. The stand-up titled the video on X as Comedian is Victim of Shocking Crime, where he shared CCTV footage of the notes being taken.He recognised the person on the surveillance footage as someone who he had met after the gig and knew where they were going for a drink. "So I went and I said: 'Hello, I’d like my notes back, please,' and they were a bit sheepish about it," he said.He added: “So, watch out if you’re planning a life of crime - there are a lot of cameras around".
