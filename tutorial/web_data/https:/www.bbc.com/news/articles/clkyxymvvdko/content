A critically endangered pheasant escaped from Plantasia Tropical Zoo in Swansea this week and had quite an adventure. Jack, now named Swansea Jack after his exploration of the city, was found on Friday morning after residents posted leads on social media to his whereabouts. Swansea Jack is one of the zoo's two male Edwards's Pheasants which are native to tropical rainforests in central Vietnam. The zoo said an internal investigation was under way to ensure "this is not repeated".
Kathryn Bulson, from Plantasia Tropical Zoo, said the species was listed as Critically Endangered in 2012 because of "deforestation, hunting, and the Vietnam War's defoliants [chemicals used in the war].""The wild population is estimated to be 50 to 249 birds, with no confirmed sightings since 2000. She said the species "thrives in human care under the international breeding programme".
Ms Bulson said the team received  "several leads" via social media about Swansea Jack being sighted around Swansea Marina. "This morning, following another lead reporting a sighting near the Civic Centre at 8am on Wednesday, Lucy and zookeeper Amy were able to locate and safely retrieved the pheasant. With the assistance of a back-up team, the pheasant was returned safely to Plantasia Tropical Zoo," she said. "He seems unfazed but glad to be home, and is currently being cared for in a quarantined area of the zoo so that he can be monitored by our zookeeper team. "He will be fully health-checked by our vet before being allowed to roam once more around our indoor hot-house with the rest of his family."
