The JFSC said: "As part of a minor maintenance update, a form that should not have been publicly available was categorised as 'public' in error."It added people affected by the data breach had been notified."Trust and confidence in the security and confidentiality of our registry system is a critical priority," the JFSC said."We are sorry this issue occurred and have undertaken a thorough review to pinpoint the exact cause to ensure this does not happen again."
It was the second data breach involving the JFSC this year after another incident occurred in January.During this breach, the JFSC said non-public names and addresses had become accessible.It said the leak, which became public in March, did not link any individuals to registered entities or roles held.
