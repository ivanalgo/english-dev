The fate of a childcare facility will be decided by councillors next week.Oscars, in Hartlepool, has provided families with out of school and holiday provision for more than 15 years.But the local authority-run facility operates at a significant loss and is facing potential closure, according to a council report.It recommended the centre be closed, which would save at least £18,000 a year, and added users could find alternative spaces elsewhere.
Currently operating out of Golden Flatts Primary School, Oscars has an average of about a dozen children a day using out of school provision and had 21 using holiday provision at the last Easter break.The service has an annual budget of £18,000 but operates at a cost far higher, with an estimated overspend for this year currently standing at £30,000.Demand has decreased following changes to the childcare market and recent promotional efforts have had "little impact" on the take up of spaces.
Hartlepool Borough Council's children's services committee will decide whether to keep it open and impose potentially prohibitive fee increases or close it.A report said the facility would create a financial risk for the Labour-led council if kept in operation."The provision of Oscars' childcare is at a cost to the local authority and despite changes to make the service financially viable, this has not been achieved," it added."An analysis of the childcare market has concluded that there is sufficient provision of childcare to meet demand should Oscars close enabling the council to meet its statutory duties."Where schools do not offer their own out of school provision, voluntary and community sector providers are "stepping in to fill that gap" locally, the report suggested.As a result, there are out of school spaces across Hartlepool, though "work would need to be undertaken" to ensure there is enough holiday provision available.While the closure is likely to cause disruption for users, the council's childcare team will work with affected families to source alternative provision, the report added.Five members of staff would be affected if the centre closes.
