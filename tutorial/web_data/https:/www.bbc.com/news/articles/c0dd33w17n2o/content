Drugs charges against a former football manager have been withdrawn by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).It told Worcester Crown Court that after a review it would not be proceeding with the case against Matt Clarke, who was formerly of Redditch United.The 50-year-old from Bromsgrove had pleaded not guilty to charges of supplying cocaine and cannabis and possessing an offensive weapon.Two co-defendants pleaded guilty to drugs charges and will be sentenced on 25 August.
Mr Clarke appeared before the court on Friday to plead not guilty to the charges of being concerned with the supply of Class A and Class B drugs and of possessing the offensive weapon, a wooden rounders bat.He had always maintained his innocence and in a post on Facebook said he “wasn’t in any way, shape or form involved in anything illegal and never involved with drugs of any kind”.A charge of criminal damage was dropped last month.The CPS did not say why it decided to discontinue the case and has been approached for a comment.It also withdrew some charges relating to the other two men.West Mercia Police was also asked for a comment, but said it was a matter for the CPS.When charges were brought in February, Redditch United announced Mr Clarke had taken an "immediate break" from his role due to "personal reasons".At the time it added: "At this stage, we anticipate this to be a short break."The BBC has approached the club to ask if he will now be reinstated.
