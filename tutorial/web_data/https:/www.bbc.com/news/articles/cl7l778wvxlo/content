Her Majesty Queen Camilla took centre stage at an event celebrating literature in Sussex.The Queen shrugged off the rain in Rye to greet waving crowds who lined the cobbled streets.She bowed to shake hands with two-year-old Bobby Neal, who was wearing a yellow rain coat.Bobby’s mother, Emma Russell, said: “It was amazing - what a memory to have for life. He’s a bit overwhelmed.”
Rev Paul White, the Team Rector of Rye, told the Queen that when Queen Elizabeth I visited Rye in 1573 she dubbed the coastal town “Royal Rye”.“So if you felt that was in your gift today, Royal Rye it is once again,” he said.The Queen met members of local organisations including the Royal Voluntary Service and Mothers’ Union at the church before walking along the street to residence Lamb House.She took flowers from well-wishers who waited to see her.Among them was Julie Barker, 59, who said: “We are so excited to be here today. We really love her she’s an amazing lady.”The Queen then viewed a literary collection Lamb House, once home to novelists Henry James, Rumer Godden and E.F. Benson.
She then attended a garden party where Oscar-winning actress Hayley Wills and actor Timothy West read extracts from E.F. Benson's novel Mapp and Lucia, which is set in Rye.Writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth guided the Queen to her seat, saying: “You’re centre stage with a cup of tea. This is a tea time performance.”Earlier in the day, the Queen attended the Charleston Festival, on the Firle Estate, where she spoke at its opening event.
