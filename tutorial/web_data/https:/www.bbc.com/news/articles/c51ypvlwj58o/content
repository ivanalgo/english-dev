Two British men reported missing in Sweden have been named, as their families launched an appeal for help locating them. Juan Cifuentes and Farooq Abdulrazak went to Denmark on Saturday and were expected to return to the UK on Sunday evening, but failed to do so.The news comes after Swedish police said two people, not yet identified by police, were found dead in a burned-out car on Sunday afternoon in Malmö. The deaths are being investigated as a suspected double murder, police said.  Asked about the incident, a Foreign Office spokesperson told the BBC it was "supporting the families of two British men reported missing in Sweden and are in touch with the local authorities". Police spokesman Patrtic Sors told the BBC he would not confirm the identity of the two men after reports in local media that they were believed to be British citizens.Mr Sors said he believed a British man had rented the car, a black Danish-registered Toyota Rav 4, at an airport in Denmark hours before the bodies were discovered in the Fosie industrial area of Malmö. Police said they were interested in any information and observations the public may have made of the car and the scene between 11:30 local time (10:30 BST) and 14:00 local time (13:00 BST) on Sunday.
