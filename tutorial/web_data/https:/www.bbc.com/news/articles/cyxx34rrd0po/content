A new Labour leader of Thurrock Council has been sworn in after the party won 27 seats at the local elections.John Kent began the new administration's premiership at the annual council meeting on Wednesday and promised "openness and honesty".Kairen Raper also took the chains of office as the Essex borough's new mayor after she was nominated for the role.The previous Conservative leader of the council, Andrew Jefferies, wished Ms Raper good luck and added: "Please try to enjoy your year as mayor."
Mr Kent admitted there would be tough times ahead, with the authority effectively declared bankrupt in 2022 after borrowing £1.5bn.“We need to be clear that Thurrock Council, although on an improvement journey, is a failing council," he said. "We are a council in the grip of government intervention and what we do is being overseen by commissioners."
Mr Kent said the council's debt remained at more than £400m."It can’t be business as usual as we set out to give Thurrock the fresh start it needs and that everyone voted for," he added.Following the council meeting, Ms Raper said she was delighted a "Tilbury girl" had been handed the prestige of becoming mayor."It’s a fantastic honour and I’m humbled to have the opportunity to serve Thurrock as mayor," she said.Outgoing mayor Sue Little said she would "shed a few tears as I have loved it so much", following her departure.Sue Shinnick was appointed as deputy mayor.The Conservative group, which is now the opposition party, has been contacted for further comment.
