Young people in North Lincolnshire will only pay £1 for single bus journeys this summer.The fare applies to those aged five to 19 during the six-week school break.Councillor Tim Mitchell, the cabinet member for connectivity, said North Lincolnshire Council was working with Hornsby Travel, Stagecoach East Midlands and East Yorkshire Buses to make improvements to bus services across the county.“This scheme is the latest development to support our young people in North Lincolnshire and encourage them to use public transport more," he added.
"There is a programme of school summer holidays activities... including free swimming sessions at our leisure centres that young people will be able to catch the bus to get to.“We have made significant improvements to our bus networks recently by extending services with extra days, later and earlier buses, and widening the network to reach more communities more often.”In addition to reduced bus fares, under-16s can also enjoy free swimming this summer at council-run leisure centres.
