Businesses in a West Sussex town are hoping for a Christmas trading boom after months of disruption following a huge fire. The blaze in March spread to the 400-year-old Angel Inn in Midhurst, which was housing Ukrainian refugees at the time. North Street remained closed to traffic for more than three months and businesses complained of lost income. Traders in Midhurst are hoping their annual Christmas street party on Friday will attract shoppers back to the town.
The fire started in a property in North Street on 15 March before spreading to the roof of the historical Angel Inn hotel next door.The repair work, involving specialist contractors, was commissioned by a multi-agency group to shore up the hotel and adjoining properties.Residents and traders have expressed frustration at how long the repairs have  taken.Audrey Cleeve owns a clothes boutique a few doors down from the Angel Inn. She said fewer people come through her doors compared to before the fire, although footfall was "picking up gradually". She also runs a B&B and "lost months and months of summer trade" from tourists. She said: “It’s absolutely devastating, because you rely on the summer months.”
Emma Harrison, who works at the Macmillan charity shop on North Street, said: "Yes, it has been traumatic. But we're on the up, I hope.”David Rudwick, curator at Midhurst Museum, said he thought "businesses are slowly bouncing back".He said: “Things are starting to creep back and we have two new cafes opening shortly."So we’re hoping come the summer, we’ll be a hub of interest again for tourists.”Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.
