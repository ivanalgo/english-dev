Clear skies meant hundreds of people across the south of England were able to see the spectacle of the Buck Moon as it rose on Sunday.Each full moon of the year is given a nickname and Buck Moon is the name given to the full moon in July.The name comes from the time of year when buck deer grow their antlers.The full moon rose at about 22:00 BST and set during the early hours of Monday.
The moon looks larger when close to the horizon due to an optical illusion.It also appears orange due to the angle it is viewed through the Earth's atmosphere.
