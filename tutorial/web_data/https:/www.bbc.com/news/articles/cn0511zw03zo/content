A primary school pupil has composed an original orchestral piece that will be premiered at a church in Somerset.Elliott's composition, called Galactic Procession, will be played for the first time at the St John the Baptist Church in Wellington at 19:30 BST on 23 July.The 11-year-old wrote the piece as part of an initiative called On the Record run by Actiontrack Performance Company.Elliott said his musical journey began when he started playing the trumpet aged five.
"I've heard lots of film music in the past, and I just really enjoyed it because of how it fits to what it's written for," said Ellliott."I kind of wanted to write something like that to surprise myself."His coach Nick Brace, who runs the On the Record project and has been working with Elliott for six months, said he is "very motivated" as a young musician.The project creates opportunities for young songwriters and composers to record music which becomes part of an album.The albums are released online, with two releases each year.Elliott was originally involved in a street band, playing the trumpet alongside his friends, and was working on a piece that made its way into one of the On the Record releases.
Elliott said he is very grateful for his family's support on his journey into music.His mum, Kristy said the rest of the family are not musical."It's alien to the rest of us in the family because none of us are musical," she said."Sometimes when he talks, we haven't got a clue about what he's going on about."But obviously very, very proud of him. "We do look at him sometimes and we just think how? How do you do it?"
