Dundee City Council has issued £187,650 of fines to non-compliant vehicles in the city's new Low Emission Zone (LEZ) in the scheme's first eight weeks.In total 3,846 fines have been issued to drivers since the LEZ was introduced on 30 May.The zone is an area only accessible to vehicles that meet minimum emission standards.The council said £53,430 of the fines issued had been paid, with £134,220 still outstanding.
Two vehicles, either a bus, minibus or lorry, breached the rules five times and were each fined £960.Thirty five other vehicles, which breached the rules four times, have been issued fines of £480 each.The majority of vehicles (3,425) were fined the initial charge of £60, which is reduced by half if it is paid within 14 days.The penalty charge rate doubles with each subsequent breach of the rules detected in the same LEZ. The rates are capped at £480 for cars and light goods vehicles, and £960 for minibuses, buses, coaches and HGVs.
The council's Fair Work, Economic Growth and Infrastructure Convener Steven Rome said: "In addition to making the city a more pleasant place to live, work and visit, the LEZ also provides health benefits to children, older people, those with existing underlying health problems, and everyone who breathes in the cleaner air."The majority of vehicles in the city comply with the LEZ requirements and will be able to carry on as they always have. "Drivers of non-compliant vehicles are encouraged to utilise the multi-story car parks situated on the periphery of the zone, and blue badge holders who are exempt are encouraged to register their vehicle online if its uncompliant.”
