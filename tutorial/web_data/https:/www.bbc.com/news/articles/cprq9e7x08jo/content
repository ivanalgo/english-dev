She found out about the blaze from the manager of the garden centre where her studio is based.Ms Dobson said: "Working with young kids I have a lot of equipment in there, which just isn't useable now, and the space itself can't be used. "I've only got a couple of weddings, so it's a tricky situation for income right now."I'm heartbroken because it's not just about income for me, I love my job. I don't have a huge amount of reserves and I've lost all my stuff."It's my main source of income."Ms Dobson thinks she won't be back up and running again in her studio until at least September.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
