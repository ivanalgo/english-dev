About 100 cats have been rescued from a property in Kent. The cats, the majority of which were black, were found at a house in Dartford by staff from the Safe Haven Animal Rescue. The rescued animals included pregnant females and kittens, according to the charity. Elise Bradley, from the Chelsfield-based organisation, said finding so many black cats in one property was "very strange" and "not normal". 
She told BBC Radio Kent: "We do find that more black cats come in for rescue than any other type of cat."It's true that lots of people are superstitious about black cats, or don't think they're pretty enough to adopt. "Sometimes people don't want black cats because they think they are more likely to get run over at night".
The cats were retrieved from the four-bedroom house on 29 May.Around 20 were found inside the property, with many more in the bushes outside. The charity said they have had to leave some of the cats while they wait for others to be rehomed.Ms Bradley said: "It definitely takes longer to rehome black cats. "And 100 is a lot."
