A van driver has appeared in court accused of killing a leading figure in shinty in a road crash.Malcolm Murchison, 70, is charged with causing death by dangerous driving, following the collision on the A87 near Portree on the Isle of Skye which resulted in the death of Donald Martin. Prosecutors say a loaded trailer that "exceeded the maximum towing capacity" detached from Mr Murchison's van and collided with Mr Martin - who was driving on the other side of the road at the time on 5 May 2022.His lawyers pled not guilty on his behalf to the charge. 
Prosecutors allege Mr Murchison did not attach the legally required "breakaway cable" to the trailer, and did not adequately distribute and secure the load.The indictment says that the tow bar "failed" and the trailer then detached from the van, going onto the opposite side of the road as a result.The case called for a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow and Lord Scott fixed a trial date of April 2025.Mr Murchison, of Skeabost Bridge, Skye, remains on bail meantime.Members of the shinty community described Mr Martin - who was 65 and known as Donnie - as a legend in the sport following his death.He was a former player and held the honorary title of chieftain of Skye Camanachd, the island's shinty club.
