The councillor in charge of education in West Northamptonshire has been urged to quit over a critical report into services for children with special educational needs.Inspectors from Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission found "widespread and systemic failings" in the service.Wendy Randall, leader of the Labour group on West Northamptonshire Council, said the report "brings absolute shame" on the Conservative-led authority.But leader of the council Adam Brown said he had "every confidence" in the current cabinet member Fiona Baker.
Services for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) in West Northamptonshire are provided by a partnership of the local council and the NHS Integrated Care Board.The report of the inspection, carried out in March, said the failings identified "must be addressed urgently".
Ms Randall said: "The report only echoes what SEND parents and families have been telling the council for years, which only fell on deaf ears."The blame for this must lie with the policies of the cabinet and the member for children and education, Fiona Baker."She called on Ms Baker "to resign and for the cabinet to appoint someone who is willing to listen to SEND parents and begin a clean page for the council's SEND provision".
In response, council leader Mr Brown said leading children's services for the council was "incredibly challenging" and the authority was facing "unprecedented demand".He said Ms Baker "has been instrumental in bringing forward the proposals which will see our SEND services make significant improvements in the coming years"."Furthermore, she has overseen improvements in performance across the other Ofsted-rated areas within her portfolio and has a passion and understanding that few could match," he said.Ms Baker has previously said there is an improvement plan in place to address the concerns raised in the report.
