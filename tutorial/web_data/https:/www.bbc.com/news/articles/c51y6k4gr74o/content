Disruption is expected as major roadworks get under way on the "old A14".An inspection of the A1307 in Cambridgeshire showed that drainage work was needed.There has been a temporary 40mph speed limit on the section between Fenstanton and St Ives since February.The county council hopes the restriction will be lifted in August.
The council took over responsibility for the A1307 from National Highways in February, following the major reconfiguration of the A14 between Cambridge and the A1.A coroner raised concerns about water on the road in May following the death of a 62-year-old man a year earlier whose car hit a patch of water.The council imposed the 40mph limit due to those safety concerns.From 29 July, one lane will be closed in both directions so soil samples can be taken and the vegetation stripped back, which will allow the drains to be cleared.The work is due to last four weeks and the lane will closed day and night on both carriageways.
If the work to clear the drains is successful, the reduced speed limit could be lifted at the end of August.Neil Shailer, vice-chairman of the highways committee at Cambridgeshire County Council, said: "We’re fully aware of the fatal incident, and the coroner’s concerns, which is why this drainage work is so important. "We’ve investigated the issues, with input from National Highways, and we’re now ready to carry out the necessary work."This area is visually going to look very different, for a while. "We’ll need to clear the vegetation right back to the soil. However, new seeds will be planted once this work is complete."Work will also start in September on the Godmanchester to Huntingdon section, where a 40mph limit is in place because of safety concerns about the barriers.
