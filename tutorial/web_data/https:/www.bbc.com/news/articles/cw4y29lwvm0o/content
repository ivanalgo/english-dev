The court heard the mother of the alleged victim contacted police to say that her daughter was with the defendant in a car and he would not allow her to leave.She also told police that the defendant had a machete with him.Police located the car and removed the defendant and a large machete from the vehicle. A subsequent search of the car also uncovered a baseball bat as well.The alleged victim was driving the car and the officer said she appeared "very distressed". In a statement, the woman said the defendant had "threatened to wrap the weapons around her throat" if she did not take him to Strabane.She also alleges on June 27 that Mr Doherty "slapped her multiple times", punched her on the back and also spat on her. At interview, Mr Doherty denied ever hitting the woman. He also claimed he was in possession of the machete for self-defence and the baseball bat because he was going to attend a game.Deputy district Judge Noel Dunlop said anyone found in possession of a machete "must face the consequences" and bail was refused.Mr Doherty was remanded in custody to appear again next month.
