Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar is attending what is likely to be his last Cabinet meeting before stepping down.Mr Varadkar announced his resignation last week.Speaking to reporters in front of Government Buildings, Mr Varadkar said this would "probably" be his last meeting, and based on a rough count it is his 650th one.He said it was "quite a busy one" as ministers aimed to get things approved before "the changeover".It is understood the Cabinet will discuss immigration, pension enrolment and a possible intervention on South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice.On Sunday, Simon Harris was confirmed as Mr Varadkar's successor as Fine Gael leader.The 37-year-old is now on course to become the country's youngest ever leader.He is not due to become taoiseach until the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) returns from the Easter recess on 9 April.However, he met Mr Varadkar on Monday to discuss the transition of power.
Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party formed a coalition government in the Republic of Ireland in 2020.On his way into Cabinet on Wednesday, Mr Harris said he aims to meet the other  party leaders, Micheál Martin (Fianna Fáil) and Eamon Ryan (Green Party). He added he intends to "turbo charge" the programme for government but he would not be drawn on a possible reshuffle among Fine Gael ministers."I'm not there at all in my head yet," Mr Harris said."I understand, respectively, why the individual appointments matter, and of course they do. But for me right now, the most important thing is policy, what can we get done for the Irish people, because I think there's a real sense out there that people want delivery."
Mr Varadkar said that rather than offer his successor advice, he would "just ask other people in the parliamentary party to give him a fair go"."There are lots of people who are going to be disappointed and that's just the nature of these things."Don't take it personally. Buckle down, work hard, and as I probably helped to demonstrate in the past couple of weeks, opportunities arise in politics all the time."Mr Varadkar added it was "too early to say" if he felt relief going into his last Cabinet."If there is one thing it is confidence, confidence that there's a really good team there and they will continue the work that I've been part of for the past 13 years. The country is in good hands."
