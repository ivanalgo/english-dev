Parents have called on Leeds City Council to put off making a decision to shut three nurseries until after the general election.The Little Owls sites in Kentmere, Gipton North and Chapel Allerton have been earmarked for closure because of "significant financial challenges".A decision on the proposals is due to be made before the election and campaigners fear decisions made now "may not be reversible".The council said it was continuing to engage with parents, carers and stakeholders.
The proposals to close three nurseries followed a review of all 24 Little Owls nurseries across Leeds, which the council said it had undertaken due to staff vacancies at the sites and financial pressures on the authority caused by the pandemic.Campaigning parents have already forced the council to delay implementing any closures until August at the earliest.But a final decision is to be made before the general election and campaigner Iain Dalton is urging the council to wait until after 4 July."It's a matter of waiting a few months to see the outcome of the election and what the immediate policy changes of a government would be," said Mr Dalton, 38."I fully expect parties to talk about childcare, because there clearly is a wider childcare crisis."The dad of one said waiting could mean a better outcome for parents, local communities and children."We think the council shouldn't be making decisions now that can't be a a reversed," he added.
A spokesperson said the council understood the concerns of those that could be affected.They added: "These are proposals at this stage and we are continuing to engage with parents, carers and other stakeholders before any final decisions are made.â€œAll views are important to us."
