Speaking to BBC Somerset, Mr Watson said: "We were hoping it would only take a year, but it's actually been amazing with all the support we've had from Jill and all the hard work of the musicians."We like to take a really active role in community events and played a concert recently for the D-Day commemorations."If we win this award, it will be mean a great deal to us to get our name out there and continue the great work that all brass bands in the country are doing," he added.
