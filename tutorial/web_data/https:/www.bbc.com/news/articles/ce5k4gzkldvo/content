A centuries-old street sport has been staged once again in a Scottish Borders town.The Uppies and the Doonies did battle on the streets of Jedburgh for its annual ba' game on Thursday.They compete to try to hurl a small leather ball to opposite ends of the town centre.There used to be hundreds of such events in the UK but only a handful remain.
