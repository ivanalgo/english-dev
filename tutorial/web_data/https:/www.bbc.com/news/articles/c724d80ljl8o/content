Lancashire's forthcoming Eden Project eco-tourism attraction has received a funding boost of up to £2.5m. The project is described as a "global garden" and will feature three large shell-shaped pavilions overlooking Morecambe Bay, becoming a sister site to the original Eden Project near St Austell, Cornwall.The money will come from the last government's Levelling Up funding.It will be used to secure external contractors to further develop the designs for the project ahead of the construction phase.
Councillor Catherine Potter said it was a "significant milestone" and brings the vision "one step closer".The cabinet member for the visitor economy, community wealth building and culture, said: "We’re all eager to see spades in the ground and there has been an awful lot of work taking place behind the scenes to ensure the project progresses as swiftly as possible." 
Phillippa Williamson, leader of Lancashire County Council, said: "This is an important step in securing the funding needed to bring this dynamic project to life."She said it will bring more visitors to the town and into the county. "This will bring undoubted benefits for jobs and growth, with a positive impact on the region," she added.It is estimated the attraction, which is expected to open in 2027, could create 1,400 jobs and attract almost a million visitors a year.
