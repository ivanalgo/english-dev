A new helipad has opened on Mull providing emergency access for air ambulances and coastguard helicopters. Construction on the landing site, adjacent to the Mull and Iona Community Hospital, began in May last year.The land for the project was donated to the local community, with the full Â£418,000 cost covered by the Helicopter Emergency Landing Pads (Help) appeal.The charity has funded helipads at both the Western Isles and Raigmore hospitals, as well as at a site near Applecross. 
A further landing site is to open on Gigha next week.  Senior charge nurse on Mull, Cheryl-Ann Paterson, said the helipad would make a huge difference to the health outcomes for patients on the island.
