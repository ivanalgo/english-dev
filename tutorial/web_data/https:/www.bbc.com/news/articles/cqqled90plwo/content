Plans to "breathe new life" into a town have been revealed months after politicians clashed over secrecy claims.A hotel, housing blocks and green space are at the centre of plans to redevelop Middlesbrough's Gresham area.The proposals from the mayoral-led Middlesbrough Development Corporation (MDC) were published ahead of a consultation period, which begins on 17 July.In December, Conservative Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen defended keeping early plans confidential "for commercial reasons" after the town's Labour MP Andy McDonald and mayor Chris Cooke called for more transparency.
At the time, Mr McDonald and Mr Cooke said they had hoped for a more open discussion around the plans after press and public were excluded from a vote to appoint developers.Mr McDonald also accused Mr Houchen of maintaining "absolute secrecy" around the proposals and criticised MDC, the planning authority for some parts of Middlesbrough, for withholding proposals from the public.In response, Mr Houchen said no detailed plans had been drawn up and said the MP's intervention was "astonishing" and an attempt to delay progress.
Initial plans have now been revealed and MDC is seeking opinions from the public on its "huge vision".The scheme includes "professionally managed, purpose-built" rental accommodation for up to 1,000 people, a hotel, green spaces and improved pedestrian links to Teesside University's campus.Work could begin in 2025 if plans are approved for the area, which has been subject to calls for improvement for several years.Mr Houchen said: "For far too long, Gresham has been a byword for the failure of those in charge to get a grip."Now we are grasping the heart of Middlesbrough with both hands."We’ve got industry experts with a brilliant vision of what is to come – but this means nothing if we don’t bring the town with us and work together."Mr Cooke said he was pleased people would have an opportunity to have a say."Creating the right kind of housing that will attract people to live in our town centre is in the best interests of everyone in Middlesbrough," he said."The site has so much potential and we’ve got to take the opportunity to deliver for the town."A public consultation event will take place in Newport Community Hub on Wednesday from 14:00 until 19:00 BST.
