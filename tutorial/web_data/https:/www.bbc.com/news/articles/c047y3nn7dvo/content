Plans for Cannock Chase to become a more bee-friendly district have been backed by councillors.Cannock Chase District Council has agreed to review "bee-friendly practices", and said it would encourage residents not to use insecticides in their gardens.It also pledged to take part in "No Mow May", an annual scheme which sees some grass areas left uncut, to encourage wildflower growth."We can make a difference; we can take a stand, we can save the bees in Cannock Chase District and, in turn, help ourselves," said councillor Andrea Muckley, who presented the motion.
Councillor Jo Elson, who seconded the motion, used the actions of Stafford, which was awarded Bee Friendly Town status earlier this year, as examples of what could be done.This included encouraging the growth of more flowers, shrubs and trees to provide nectar and pollen, supporting community groups to enhance their local spaces, and asking residents to sow wildflower seeds and bee-friendly plants.Councillors acknowledged the authority would need to publicise future "No Mow May" schemes more widely, after previous mowing delays sparked complaints from residents about the appearance of public areas."Residents who arenâ€™t aware of campaigns are likely to assume that grass hasn't been cut because of a lack of council resources or, more damagingly to our reputation, because the council does not care about their area," said Ms Elson."By making bee-friendly changes we could ensure that the whole mind-set of the council is changed; that nature and the environment become a central thread in our future decisions."
