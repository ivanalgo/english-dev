The family of the elderly man, whose age has not been released, have been informed and they are being supported by officers, GMP said. It said the force's professional standards directorate was conducting further inquiries due to concerns around the initial response. Anyone who was in the residential area between 22:30 BST and 23:30 on Friday is urged to get in touch with police. Det Ch Insp Andrew Naismith said there were a number of inquiries being conducted to establish what happened. He added: "Iâ€™m sure that news of this nature will also be concerning for our communities. "We have deployed additional officers to the area... Any information you may have, no matter how small it may seem, might be crucial to our investigation and help a grieving family get the answers they deserve."
