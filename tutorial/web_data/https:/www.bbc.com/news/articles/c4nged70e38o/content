A council has approved plans for legal graffiti walls to be created in parts of a town.Boston Borough Council's cabinet endorsed the policy at a meeting on Wednesday.Councillors said the move could help “brighten up” Boston and attract more tourists.The idea was first adopted by neighbouring South Holland District Council after a successful pilot project in Spalding.
The new policy would see a planning-style application process, with consideration given to factors including whether the artwork was offensive, or appropriate to a particular location, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.Councillor Emma Cresswell, portfolio holder for communities, said she was “really excited by this policy,” especially its focus on engaging with schools and colleges.Deputy leader Dale Broughton noted that this could also create a “positive talking point” for the town.“This opens up the whole borough to a lot of things,” he said.
A pilot project took place at the Castle Sports Complex in Spalding last year following a campaign by local graffiti artists Karl Barfoot and Adam Sadd.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram. Send your story ideas to eastyorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk
