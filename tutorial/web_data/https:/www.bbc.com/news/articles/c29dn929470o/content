A campaign has been launched to restore an "much loved" wooden sculpture after it suffered extensive damage.The Peterborough Arch at Thorpe Meadows, overlooking the Longthorpe Parkway, was commissioned by Peterborough Development Corporation in the 1980s and created by artist Lee Grandjean.Following an annual inspection last year, the artwork, made from rare iroko wood,  had to be removed as a safety measure to be investigated by specialist conservationists, with restoration works expected to cost £50,000.Nene Park Trust said the city’s sculpture collection had an "important role to play in restoring and preserving Peterborough’s cultural heritage" and it has started the Save Peterborough Arch fundraiser.
The trust has received "lovely feedback" from members of the public about the piece of art described as the "linchpin of the wider sculpture collection" and was voted as Peterborough’s favourite sculpture last year in an online poll.The trust also said it was "grateful" to have received funding from the Henry Moore Foundation and the National Lottery Heritage Fund but was now in need of additional public support.An appeal has been launched to raise £3,000 for restoration works as well as for the maintenance and development of the entire Sculpture Collection which comprises 30 sculptures, including works by Antony Gormley and Anthony Caro.Additionally, two public art workshops are being held at Ferry Meadows on the 8 and 12 August and a "creative competition" for children aged 4-17 running until 15 August to support the funding appeal.Matthew Bradbury, chief executive of the trust, said: "Nene Park Trust, as guardians of the Peterborough Sculpture Collection, has an important role to play in restoring and preserving our city’s cultural heritage for future generations and creating new opportunities for children and young people in the city to engage with art and our heritage.“With the public’s help this much loved and admired sculpture will be given a new lease of life. "It will be restored and reinstated. Whilst we will need to find the money to do so, we plan to protect and preserve this important collection for years to come.”
