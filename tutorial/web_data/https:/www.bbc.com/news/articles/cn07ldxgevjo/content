A runner who is raising funds for a military veterans' charity is due to end a 50-mile (80km) run at a circus.Darren Baker will finish later in his home town of Corby, Northamptonshire, after running in different towns and cities in England and Wales.He said he would exceed his distance target by about six miles (10km).His final stop will be the Ukrainian Cortex Circus in West Glebe Park.
Mr Baker's running challenge is raising money for Royal British Legion Industries, which provides employment opportunities for veterans and the families of serving military personnel.
As he neared the end of his run in the 80th anniversary year of the D-Day landings, he said he "felt it was important to do something to honour the people that took part". "There's hardly any people left, unfortunately, and I thought it might be the last time to come together as a nation," he said.
Mr Baker's work as a health and safety adviser takes him across the UK, so he has completed his run in stages, taking in places like Merthyr Tydfil, Manchester and Reading.He said: "The most challenging and picturesque part was Merthyr Tydfil, Ebbw Valley and Barry Island in South Wales."
The run will end at West Glebe Park, where the Ukrainian Cortex Circus is staging its latest show.He said the run had been "a challenge, but I've enjoyed it". "I've met some great people along the way and a lot of people have been supporting me," he said.
