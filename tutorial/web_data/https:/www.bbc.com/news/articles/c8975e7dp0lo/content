Rain gardens that slow down surface run-off after downpours have been introduced in Grimsby.North East Lincolnshire Council has replaced sections of grass in Broadway with flower beds containing channels to catch rainfall.Water is then funnelled into storage tanks, before it eventually reaches the sewer.The council said the scheme “lessened the flood risk”.
Councillor Henry Hudson, who has responsibility for the environment and net zero, said: “This a great idea and two-fold in providing a floral backdrop along Broadway along with lessening the flood risk.”Properties in the Scartho area of Grimsby were affected by flooding in the town in May.The council said then that it maintained the drains but added the rainfall was so severe it temporarily overloaded the drainage system.The rain garden on Broadway is the second such scheme carried out in North East Lincolnshire from a £3m fund awarded by the government.The money was ringfenced for flood and coastal resilience schemes that aim to address the challenges of the changing climate.The first scheme saw roof irrigation planters installed at four schools.  The planters  allow rainwater from the roof to flow directly into planter beds, increasing flood resilience by absorbing water and slowing the flow.Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
