A "dangerous sexual predator" who raped two women on separate occasions while they slept in their beds has been sentenced to 16 years in prison.Both victims reported to Essex Police that Ricky Lee, 28, had entered their bedrooms in South Ockendon and Benfleet and attacked them.Lee, of Coronation Avenue in East Tilbury, pleaded not guilty to three counts of rape, but was convicted in October following a two-week trial. He was sentenced at Basildon Crown Court.Police said the impact of Lee's attacks was "devastating", with one woman moving across the country to get a new start.
The offences happened in 2019 and 2020. Det Con Karen Miller, from Essex Police, said: "Results like these are exactly why we do this job. To put perpetrators behind bars and support the most vulnerable of victims."The bravery of these two victims to report what Lee did to them has protected other women from a dangerous sexual predator."In both these cases, Lee raped the vulnerable women in their own beds and attempted to lie when being interviewed by police."The impact of Lee's crimes is devastating, with one victim moving across the country to try and get a fresh start."Essex Police said Synergy Essex provides specialist support for victims and survivors of rape and sexual abuse of all ages and genders across the whole county.
