Power has been restored to hundreds of homes following an underground fault in Lancashire. Police and fire crews initially responded to reports of an "explosion" in the Broadway area of Fleetwood on Monday. Electricity North West confirmed 910 properties in the area were affected by a power cut at about 19:00 BST. The power failure was caused by a glitch with an underground electricity cable, the company confirmed. A statement said they were able to restore power to 442 properties nine minutes later and a further 130 properties within the hour. Teams carried out repair works to restore power to another 162 at about 21:20 BST, before all homes were reconnected.
