Park users are being asked to come up with ideas to decorate a bench which will be created from a landmark fallen tree.The sycamore, which stood in Graves Park in Sheffield, was toppled in December by heavy winds and rain during Storm Elin.Believed to be about 150 years old, the popular landmark was affectionately known to visitors as 'The Lone Tree' due to its isolated position.Kurtis Crossland, chair of the communities, parks and leisure committee at Sheffield City Council, said: “Our hopes are to create a bench that incorporates people’s memories of the tree."
A Facebook group was set up for people to share their memories and pictures of the tree after it fell.“We know just how important the ‘Lone Tree’ that stood in Graves Park was to local people and park visitors," said Mr Crossland.As part of plans to create a lasting memorial, a sculptor will be tasked with bringing people's tributes to the tree "to life" in a bench design.“We hope to finalise plans for the bench over the summer," said Mr Crossland.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
