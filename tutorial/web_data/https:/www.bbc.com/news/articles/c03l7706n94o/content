A parent has expressed concerns over the future of a new school in Surrey for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). Elizabeth Marett wanted a place for her son and said she was frustrated by the lack of progress with Betchwood Vale Academy near Dorking.Planning permission for the school, which would include support for autistic children, was approved by Mole Valley District Council (MVDC) on 1 March 2023, but a challenge means the proposals have been halted. MVDC said it recognised the need for SEND education provision and was assisting with a fresh planning application. 
“The delay leaves parents of disabled children desperately scrabbling around for some kind of alternative provision, in the hope that they will have a chance for an education,” Ms Marett said.MVDC decided not to proceed with the planning application as it said this was the "swiftest - and most cost efficient - manner in which to progress". “The chances are few and far between in this area and honestly, we are all losing faith in the hollow proclamations of politicians and councillors that disabled children really matter," said Ms Marett."If the children matter, then do something to help them."Margaret Cooksey, cabinet member for planning on MVDC, said the authority recognised the increased need for SEND school provision in Surrey, and the challenges and disappointment that a delay caused to local communities.
The school originally had a provisional opening date of September 2025.Residents from a private road near the site had previously objected to the application, claiming it would have an adverse impact on traffic flow and the approach to Dorking, and a negative effect on biodiversity.Planning officers had also recommended the plan for refusal because the site is in the green belt.Ms Cooksey said MVDC was working with the Department for Education to "assist them in bringing forward the additional information they wish to present for the reconsideration of the planning application"."Once this relevant information is submitted, MVDC will undertake statutory planning consultation in the usual manner," she added.
