A church has applied to install CCTV cameras to deter “sex, fighting and drug use” in its graveyard.All Saints Parish Church in High Wycombe has asked Buckinghamshire Council to grant it a certificate of lawfulness for the new cameras in order to improve security.Its application, submitted by the Reverend Anthony Searle, shows two points on the church’s exterior where they would be fixed.The Church of England has already given permission for the plans, on the condition that they meet planning rules.
According to its website, there has been a church on the Castle Street site for more than 900 years, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.In its application to the planning committee, it said: "The CCTV is to hopefully reduce the antisocial behaviour in the churchyard: drug taking and dealing; sexual activity; fighting."The cameras, which feature "ultra-wide angle lenses, 24-hour colour vision, 'human-vehicle classification', strobe lighting and audio", would be fixed either side of the far south-eastern corner of the building, overlooking the churchyard, path and nearby graves.The Diocese of Oxford has already said the installation of the cameras is work that can be undertaken with permission from the archdeacon.
