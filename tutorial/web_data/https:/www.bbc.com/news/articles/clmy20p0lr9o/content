The partners at a town's GP surgery have warned of an "impending crisis" due to being at full capacity when more housing is planned for the area.They called for investment into larger premises for Woodstock Surgery in a letter sent to patients, councils, and health service providers.West Oxfordshire District Council (WODC) said it looked "carefully" at health infrastructure with regard to housing planning applications.The Estate at Blenheim Palace, which is housebuilding nearby, said it would provide a "financial contribution".
In their letter, the doctors said they were "already managing patient loads that exceed those of comparable local practices"."While we understand the need for housing development to accommodate a growing population, this expansion presents considerable challenges," they said.Increased demandThe partners said the amount of patients was not sustainable, and it was putting a strain on the quality of care, and increasing waiting times. They added: "We are stretched thin in terms of medical resources and administrative support, making it increasingly difficult to maintain the high standards of care our patients deserve."The surgery said new housing and increased demand could mean it having to stop accepting new patients. It called for "transparency and engagement" with the community regarding future plans, and said "timely and co-ordinated action" could still "mitigate the negative impacts" of new developments.
One patient at the surgery, who did not want to be named, told the BBC that it was "getting increasingly difficult to get an appointment or get through on the phone"."When you do get through there are no appointments available for at least two weeks," they said."You find yourself phoning at 08:30 every morning hoping for an emergency appointment."The staff are really helpful, patient, and empathetic despite the obvious stress of the situation."A spokesperson for the Estate at Blenheim Palace said: "We have been and will continue to work with the doctors to help find a suitable location for a new surgery."WODC's local plan envisions 600 new homes in Woodstock.A spokesperson said: "We are aware that there are concerns in Woodstock over GP capacity.  "The ability of supporting infrastructure, including health infrastructure, to accommodate growth is something that is looked at carefully when we consider planning applications for housing. "The local doctors need to evidence their requirements by commenting upon large scale applications when they are tabled with us such that we can look to the applicant to demonstrate how they will address any infrastructure needs."The Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire & West Berkshire Integrated Care Board has not responded to the BBC's requests for a comment.
