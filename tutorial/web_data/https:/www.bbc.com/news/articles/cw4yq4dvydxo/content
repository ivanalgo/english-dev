Eight people have been arrested after Just Stop Oil protesters targeted Gatwick Airport's departure gates, Sussex Police say. The organisation said seven members of the environmental protest group entered the South Terminal at about 08:00 BST on Monday and "used suitcases with lock-on devices to block the departure gates".The action is part of the "Oil Kills international uprising", the group said, taking action at airports around the world.A London Gatwick spokesperson said: “London Gatwick is open and operating normally today. There are a small number of protesters at the airport who have now been arrested and are being removed from the airport.”
In June, 27 Just Stop Oil protesters were arrested by the Metropolitan Police, including four at Gatwick Airport.Earlier this month Gatwick secured a High Court injunction in an attempt to stop activists trespassing on its land after receiving police intelligence over protest plans.A spokesperson for Sussex Police said: "Police responded to a report that protesters were demonstrating near the security entrance at the South Terminal in Gatwick Airport."Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of interfering with public infrastructure, and a heightened police presence should be expected at this time."The airport is functioning as usual, and no disruption has been caused by protest activity."
Asked for the prime minister's message to the demonstrators, his official spokesman told reporters: "Obviously we recognise the democratic right of people to peacefully express their views, but obviously they should do so within the bounds of the law."And clearly being seen to significantly disrupt people's summer holidays is no way of winning people around to your cause."
