People are being encouraged to share their views on major regeneration plans for Wolverhampton that will see up to 1,000 homes built along with shops and public spaces.The City Centre West development covers a 12-acre (4.9-hectare) site linking School Street and Darlington Street and the area around Market Square.The council and the developer said they were beginning engagement events to "understand the challenges, opportunities and priorities of the community".Residents were told they could attend two events on 25 and 31 July at The Urban Room in Queen Square.
Under the plans, a "long-term, phased transformation" will see 800 to 1,000 homes  built along with leisure, retail, and high-quality public spaces, the council said.Earlier this month the authority made a development agreement with ECF - a public-private partnership between Homes England, Legal & General and financial services group Muse - to deliver the project.ECF will develop the proposal ahead of submitting a planning application for the first phase and then an outline planning application for the rest of the site will be submitted later this year. 
A new multi-million pound food and drinks space initially planned for a site in Bell Street will now potentially move to the Market Square area as part of the City Centre West plan, the council said.The relocation was subject to a final business case and approval by the council’s cabinet, the authority said.Detailed images or plans of the City Centre West development will not be on show at the two public events, the council said, but officials wanted to hear initial reaction from residents ahead of further planned events.Councillor Chris Burden said: “It’s a chance to engage with our delivery partnership, to share challenges and opportunities and help inform the designs and subsequent planning application."I encourage as many residents as possible to engage and share their views.”
