Earlier this week, the company's co-owner Sacha Lord - a night-time economy adviser to Greater Manchester Metro Mayor Andy Burnham - described the news site's claims as "defamatory and factually incorrect"."We vehemently disagree with information and statements presented in the article and strongly dispute the accuracy, reliability and transparency of its sources," he added. The Parklife and Warehouse Project co-founder is one of three owners of the firm, which was awarded £401,928 from the recovery fund that was administered by Arts Council England.
