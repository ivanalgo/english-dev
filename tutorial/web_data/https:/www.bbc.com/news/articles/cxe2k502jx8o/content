None of Nottinghamshire's recycling centres will close before upgraded alternatives are built, officials have promised.Concerns over the capacity of the county council's current network of 12 sites had prompted a review.Subsequent proposals, to close some existing centres and replace them with larger but fewer "supersites", were opposed by some councillors and also prompted a 6,000 name petition.Now a motion to keep the current network for the time being, while also seriously considering keeping all 12 current centres, has been adopted by the council.It also calls on the authority to “carefully consider” the distance users would have to travel.
The cross-party review began in 2022 after concerns some of the centres were cramped, congested and not “fit for purpose”.It said the new supersites would be easier to use, save £1.7m a year and still leave 97% of residents within a 20-minute drive of a centre.The new motion – originally submitted by the independents and amended by the Conservatives – was passed at a meeting by all parties to reassure residents, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service.But it does not confirm whether there will be a one-for-one replacement of the sites.Steve Carr, independent councillor for Bramcote and Beeston North, said: “Recycling rates in Broxtowe are plummeting, and I suspect it’s the same in other districts.“I’m concerned about the outcome of this proposal – will we have one replacement site covering where there used to be three?”Ashfield and Mansfield were highlighted as two struggling tips which could benefit from a supersite.Conservative councillor Nigel Moxon said he often saw vehicles queuing for an hour to get into the Mansfield centre, and change was urgently needed.Labour councillor Penny Gowland said: “The current situation is completely appropriate, and doesn’t work for places like Orston and West Bridgford.“But I don’t think this is the right solution. We need a broader root and branch review of how we are collecting waste.”The review recommendations will be studied by the council cabinet on 25 July.Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
