Communities in Cumbria are going dark to help reveal "thousands of stars" which are usually hidden by light pollution.Keswick is the latest to take part in the Dark Skies project, joining Ambleside and Grasmere in turning off its street lights.The initiative is run by the Friends of the Lake District, which is encouraging residents and businesses to join in and turn their lights off.The Big Switch Off will take place in Keswick on 8 February, and in Ambleside and Grasmere on 9 February.
Kay Andrews, from Friends of the Lake District, said: "A very small moon, and weather permitting, clear skies, will give us a really impressive view of thousands of stars after all the lights go off. "Each year more businesses and people take part, and we’ve produced a Dark Skies booklet for hoteliers to encourage their guests outside and help identify some of the major star constellations."
It will be the first time Keswick has taken part in the event, with the switch off scheduled at 19:00 GMT.The lights will go dark around Crow Park and Hope Park, with free activities taking place.Vanessa Metcalfe, tourism manager at Keswick Tourism Association, said: "We often see lots of fantastic night-time photographs of the Milky Way, whether above Derwentwater or Castlerigg Stone Circle. "So we’ve arranged for some experts with telescopes and cameras to show us the wonderful displays from Crow Park next to Derwentwater, which has a fantastic dark sky free from light pollution."Activities in Crow Park include stargazing, night-time photography and a "stargazing and forest bathing" session.
