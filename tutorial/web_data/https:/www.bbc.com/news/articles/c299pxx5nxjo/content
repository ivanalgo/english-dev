A convenience store has been ordered to close after selling illegal cigarettes, tobacco and vapes.Durham County Council secured the closure of Shop & Go in Annfield Plain for three months, following a court order.A total of 246 cigarettes, 106 pouches of 50g (1.8oz) hand-rolling tobacco and 187 vapes were seized.The cigarettes, tobacco and vapes were without the correct packaging and health warnings.
The shop was shut down after two test purchases and several inspections.During one of the inspections, the items were found in the engine compartment of a  car next to the shop.
Gary Carr, Durham County Council’s strategic regulation manager, said illicit tobacco had a "detrimental impact on our communities"."It has links to organised crime, can harm people’s health, and makes it easier for young people to obtain unsafe items," he said."It also has an impact on businesses in the area which are compliant."The estimated value of the cigarettes and tobacco was £2,502. If sold legally, they would have had a rough price of £6,328.36.The value of the vapes was £1,860."This case should serve as a warning to non-compliant businesses that they face the risk of closure and being taken to court if they are found to be selling illicit products," Mr Carr added.Newton Aycliffe Magistrates Court granted a three-month closure order for nuisance in relation to the sale and possession of illicit tobacco and non-compliant vapes.Shop & Go were also ordered to pay £1,398 in costs.
