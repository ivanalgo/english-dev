A driver who killed a 13-year-old boy in a hit-and-run has had his sentence increased after High Court judges ruled it was "unduly lenient".Kaylan Hippsley died three days after being hit by a car driven by Harley Whiteman on Brecon Road in Hirwaun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, on 29 February.In April, Whiteman, 20, was sentenced to six years and nine months, as well as being banned from driving for eight years and four months. Whiteman, who had been drinking and taking cocaine before the crash and later returned to the scene, swearing at people who were trying to help the dying boy, has now had his sentence increased to nine years.
On the day of the crash, Whiteman swerved to avoid hitting another car, which caused him to mount the kerb and hit Kaylan, throwing him into the air.A hearing at the High Court in London on Wednesday heard the original sentence gave too much weight to the defendant's age and should be increased.Kelly Brocklehurst, representing the attorney general, said Judge Jeremy Jenkins at Cardiff Crown Court had identified aggravating factors such as Whiteman driving in a "highly impaired state" at speeds "highly inappropriate for a built up areaHe said Kaylan "was a pedestrian and a young one at that, standing in a place he should have been safe".Mr Brocklehurst argued maturity and age should be "limited" mitigating factor, as the offence was "so serious".But James Hartson, representing Whiteman, said the original sentence was "in no way lenient".The court heard Whiteman had been undertaking a carpentry apprenticeship at college and was described by a youth worker as an "exemplary young person".Mr Hartson added the incident had been "wholly out of character for him".
Quashing the original sentence, Lord Justice William Davis said it had been "unduly lenient" and should be increased.He said, while the original sentencing remarks referred to the defendant's age, there was "no evidence that the offender was particularly immature"."In this instance, it was not of such significance to outweigh the aggravating mitigating factors,” he added.Whiteman was told he would now spend at least two-thirds of his nine-year sentence custody, up from half of his previous sentence.His disqualification from driving was also increased to 11 years.Whiteman appeared in court via video link from the young offenders institution where he is serving his sentence and spoke only to confirm his name and that he had understood the court’s decision.Kaylan's family also attended court.Speaking after the hearing, his cousin Julie Craig said the family felt "justified" in appealing the sentence, adding: "But it doesn't take away from the fact that we miss Kaylan immensely."
