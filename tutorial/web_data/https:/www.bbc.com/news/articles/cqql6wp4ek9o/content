Strike action is set to cause disruption at three Derbyshire schools.Staff in the National Education Union (NEU) will walk out on Tuesday for three days over a pay dispute with the QEGSMAT trust.The action will mean the City of Derby Academy, Chellaston Academy in Derby and Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Ashbourne will have to close to most pupils for three days.The NEU said talks over an alleged five-month delay to a pay rise broke down this week.
Following an ongoing dispute over back pay, a meeting on Wednesday was described by the union as “fractious”.Members said Anne Martin, the trust’s chief executive, promised to make an offer in writing that they say was never made.In letters to parents and guardians of pupils, head teachers at two of the schools have stated they feel there is no legal basis for the industrial action.
Scott Garrity, head teacher at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, said: “Despite the significant concessions made by the trust, the NEU has taken the decision to strike on the issue of back pay for some support staff.“We are saddened and disappointed by this, particularly for our students, whose learning will now be disrupted.”Nick Raine, NEU senior regional officer in the East Midlands, said: “Staff at the schools are simply asking to be treated as other staff are under nationally-agreed terms and conditions, and receive the back pay they are entitled to."This isn’t a huge amount of money.”The NEU said it planned to picket all three schools over the three days and leaflet in the areas.It added further strike action could be considered should an agreement not be reached.In a statement, QEGSMAT said: "Any delay has not been due to a lack of engagement from QEGSMAT, or a reluctance to negotiate and make change. QEGSMAT is committed to conducting itself professionally and values respect, honesty and fairness."Children and young people are at the heart of every decision made and action taken by QEGSMAT."Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
