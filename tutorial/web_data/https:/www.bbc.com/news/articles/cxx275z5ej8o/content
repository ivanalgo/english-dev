Rain-soaked crowds gathered to watch as the 138th Durham Miners' Gala wound its way through the streets on Saturday.This year's event marked the 40th anniversary of the miners' strike and saw brass bands, trade union groups and pit banners come together in a lively parade.On the eve of the annual gala, organisers launched a fundraising appeal to help meet its rising costs.Friends of Durham Miners' Gala (FODMG) chair Dave Anderson said: "The gala needs the solidarity of the people more than ever."
FODMG said the free to attend gala is thriving again following the impact of mine closures that began in the 1980s, but needs all who value the event to help safeguard its future.Mr Anderson described the event's survival since the 1984 strike and "subsequent destruction of the coal mining industry" as remarkable."This is due to the solidarity shown by the people who were determined it must continue," he said.For more than a century, the event was funded by Durham's working miners through subscriptions to their trade union, the Durham Miners Association (DMA).Now, it is funded by donations and subscriptions through FODMG, with contributors known as "Marras"."I urge everyone who values the gala to chip in and join our band of Marras," Mr Anderson added.
Ahead of the event, also known as the Durham Big Meeting, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) called on the government to quash the convictions of miners prosecuted as a result of the strikes.General secretary Matt Wrack said: "Miners faced the brutal force of the state to crush the strikers and their communities. Thousands were arrested or injured by police. "We call on the Labour government to take this historic opportunity to do whatâ€™s right by announcing a plan to quash their convictions and offer compensation."The BBC has contacted the government for comment.
