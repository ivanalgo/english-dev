Thousands of paper doves have been unveiled at Durham Cathedral in a new exhibition.Peace Doves, an installation created by Peter Walker, is suspended from ribbons above the cathedral's nave.Made by visitors, community groups and schoolchildren over recent months, each dove includes a personal message of hope.The display will run until 4 September and is accompanied by music from composer David Harper.
Julie Carr, from Stokesley, was among the first visitors to see the artwork and described it as "stunning"."It's such a breath-taking installation," she said. "The movement in it is lovely and so very peaceful."Peace is such an inclusive topic that people of all ages and different communities can engage with, so its wonderful to see."
John Garside, one of the volunteers who helped visitors make the doves, said it was "great to see what we've been creating for the past few months finally come to life".
Chaplain John Gilbert added: "It's truly amazing what can be achieved with something so simple as paper and messages of hope."A programme of peace-inspired events will accompany the installation, including a special Evensong on Sunday, 28 July to reflect on the artwork.Peace Doves has been staged at venues across the UK since 2018 when it marked the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One.
