A volunteer has said he will "fight" a council's plans to charge people to play the sport they love.Users of tennis courts in four parks across Kirklees will have to pay to access facilities that were previously free once a refurbishment programme has been completed.Among those affected are members of Huddersfield Pickleball, a club which holds regular sessions at Greenhead Park.Although Kirklees Council said the fees would pay for the courts' upkeep, the club's organiser Roger Wigram called their decision "crazy".
The weekly sessions are popular with retired people as the sport is suitable for all ages and fitness levels. It is played on a smaller court with plastic balls and paddle-style bats.Mr Wigram said he had introduced around 60 players to pickleball and that he wanted the council to "honour" their agreement that the club could use the tennis courts for free.Nineteen public courts in Huddersfield, Batley, Dewsbury and Heckmondwike will be upgraded during the summer with funding from the Lawn Tennis Association.Retired brewery worker Mr Wigram, 84, said the fees would "shut the door" on prospective players."People who have never played the game before aren't going to risk paying for something in case they don't like it," he said.The council said some free slots would still be available, but added that their number and frequency had yet to be decided.Mr Wigram said he had paid for bespoke markings to be painted on three courts at Greenhead Park and supplied all the equipment needed for the sessions.The group currently has an agreement with the council to use the courts for two hours each Thursday."All we are asking is for the continuation of what we have," said Mr Wigram."I want to fight this. I expect them to honour their agreement."
Kirklees Council said that court hire charges had been in place for "a long time" but were difficult to enforce without lockable gates, which would be installed as part of the refurbishment.A spokesperson added that discounts would be available for block bookings and "free play" slots at selected times could be reserved.The £206,427 investment in the courts is part of a programme funded by the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) and the government to make tennis more accessible.An LTA spokesperson told the BBC: "The LTA does not require local authorities receiving investment through the Parks Tennis Project to charge for the use of their courts. "It is a requirement of funding that there be a long-term sustainability plan in place to ensure that refurbished courts can be maintained for the benefit of local communities for many years to come."The spokesperson added: "We're collaborating with local authorities to ensure that effective operating models are in place for facilities and sinking funds are generated to finance future renovation works."Pickleball England estimated that the sport now has 30,000 regular participants.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
