Keele University is holding its third annual football tournament for refugees and asylum seekers on Thursday.The tournament will see 11 teams battle it out for trophies and medals.The university will also provide an outreach session, to show participants how to access further and higher education."There's so much more to it than just having a nice game of football," said organiser Russell Clark.
"It helps the refugees realise that there is support for them, that they are welcome in the community."The tournament is organised by Mr Clark, who is the head of the university's language centre, with help from local refugee charity Asha North Staffordshire, which helps to bring in participants.In its first year, eight teams took part, in its second, it rose to 16."This year, we've got 11 teams, mainly because some of the hotels that were hosting asylum seekers and refugees have closed down," Mr Clark told the BBC.On Thursday morning, the university will gather the teams to highlight the educational opportunities available to them.
"A lot of them come to the UK having left behind well-trained positions," said Mr Clark."They've got skills, what they don’t necessarily have is the qualifications, or they may want to retrain."He added that the six-aside competition in the afternoon offered a "bonding experience"."The players are very keen to win this. We have some very high standard players as well."With about 25 volunteers from the university and local community helping out, Mr Clark said it showed the players that they could integrate into local society."It’s nice for the asylum seekers and refugees to, in many cases, practice their English," he said."One of the people who took part in the first competition is training to be a physiotherapist at Keele."
