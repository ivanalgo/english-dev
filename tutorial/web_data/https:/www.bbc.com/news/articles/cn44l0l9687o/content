Nearly a hundred beach huts will be erected on a stretch of seafront in Kent.The 93 colourful wooden structures will be on the edge of Coast Drive car park, in Greatstone, facing towards the sea.Folkestone and Hythe District Council said the project will help to reduce the list of 700 people currently waiting for a beach hut in the area.The development also includes a new visitor centre, water sports facilities, a 121-space car park and funding to protect the natural habitats of bird nesting nearby in the winter months.
The visitor centre will include an education space, a caf√©, public and accessible toilets, showers and changing rooms.Initial designs would have seen the new huts placed at the top of the beach, however it was agreed that they would sit on the edge of the car park to ensure the shingle is not disturbed.
