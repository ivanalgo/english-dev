Brighton and Hove has elected its first ever South Asian Muslim mayor.Councillors unanimously voted for Mohammed Asaduzzaman, who was elected to Brighton & Hove City Council in the Hollingdean and Fiveways ward last May.Council leader Bella Sankey said Mr Asaduzzaman was “warm, kind, funny and ambitious for our city”.“Brighton and Hove can look forward to a mayor whose compassion has already left a mark on the city’s social, cultural, economic and political landscape,” she said.
Mr Asaduzzaman, who has lived in the city for 30 years, previously worked with the state minister for irrigation and water development in Bangladesh, and has a degree in political science.During the Covid-19 pandemic, he provided 500 free meals to essential service providers.He also pushed for vaccinations for those with uncertain immigration status, acted as an interpreter for those in legal need and gave support to victims of crime.Ms Sankey added: “With three decades of residency in Brighton, he has woven himself into the very fabric of the community.“His journey from Bangladesh to Brighton exemplifies a life dedicated to public service and community betterment.”
In Brighton and Hove, the mayor has a largely ceremonial role as first citizen, as well as chairing meetings of full council.Each year, the mayor traditionally supports local charities. The 63-year-old has chosen BHT Sussex, the Sussex Cricket Foundation, Chomp Brighton, My University Hospitals Sussex, Brighton Students’ Union and the Royal Pavilion and Museums Trust.Labour councillor Amanda Grimshaw was elected as deputy mayor and is expected to take over the mayoralty in a year.
