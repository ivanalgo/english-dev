Children who qualify for free school meals in one borough could be enrolled in the scheme automatically.At present, families in Middlesbrough must apply, meaning some pupils slip through the net.Under auto-enrolment, parents would still be invited to apply for free school meals and remain able to opt out. Middlesbrough Council's executive will be asked to approve the pilot on 26 June.
The council estimate that free school meals save families an average of £400 per year, but some do not apply due to low levels of literacy, language barriers or stigma.A report for the executive also explained that free meals triggered pupil premium funding to help disadvantaged students reach their full potential.In 2024-25, this will come to £1,480 of extra government funding per year for each primary schoolchild and £1,050 for a secondary school student.
South Tees joint director of public health Mark Adams said: "We want to ensure as high a take-up as possible for free school meals, so that eligible children are getting access to a healthy meal that is so important to their development."He added that the pupil premium funding helped support the "incredible" work schools did.
