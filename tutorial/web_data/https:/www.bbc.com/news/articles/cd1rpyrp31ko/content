A bar has had its alcohol licence suspended following a number of violent incidents at the premises.Peterborough City Council took the action against Bar 42, on Broadway, following an application by Cambridgeshire Police. A licensing hearing took place on Wednesday.The authority said a woman was subjected to a serious sexual assault within the bar last November - and two further violent incidents took place on 11 and 20 July, when a man was hospitalised with a bleed on the brain.Insp Sam Tucker, from Peterborough’s Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: “We note the decision of the committee and believe there was no option but to take this action following the recent serious incidents of violence."
Bar 42 director Yasir Ali told the BBC: "The safety of our customers is our number one priority."
The application was submitted by the police to the council’s Regulatory Services Licensing team, who are responsible for issuing licences for the provision of music, late night refreshments and the sale of alcohol at more than 500 venues in Peterborough."Despite licensing officers from both the council and police advising the premises over many months, concerns have escalated," the city council said.The suspension of the Premises Licence - or permission to serve alcohol - will remain until a full hearing on 20 August at Peterborough Town Hall.
Insp Sam Tucker added: "We have worked with the licence holder with advice being given to address issues, however we are still concerned for public safety within the venue."Dennis Jones, the leader of Peterborough City Council, said: "The sub committee decision supported by the licensing and legal team is the correct and appropriate action to take as we will not accept or tolerate licensed premises failing to consider public safety in the city."
Mr Ali said the recent instalment of an ID scanning machine at the venue had been "a great asset"."Though we are saddened at the decision that has been made, we respect the paths that have to be followed and hope we can work with the relevant bodies to make Bar 42 a safe place for our customers to enjoy once again," he added.
