A local authority has elected its first new leader in two decades.Liberal Democrat councillor David Hingley will now lead Cherwell District Council, having been the only person nominated for the position.The Lib Dems became the largest party on the council at the recent local elections.Conservative Barry Wood had previously lead the authority for 20 years, but his position became untenable after his party fell to the third largest on the council.
The Tories lost nine seats at the elections, while the Lib Dems gained seven - meaning the council remains under no-overall control.
The Liberal Democrats will enter into a minority administration with Green and independent councillors.Mr Hingley said he was “confident" that he and his Liberal Democrat and executive colleagues would "rise to that challenge for residents to deliver for the whole district".“I’m proud to be here as the new leader: the first new leader for 20 years. And I’m proud to represent Cherwell, my home," he added.Cherwell Labour, which is the second largest party on the authority, said it had been approached by the Liberal Democrats about how they might work together to run the council.“During those discussions we made it clear that we could not support their agenda on important issues like the Local Plan," a statement said."They also do not share Labour's priorities of getting more homes built to tackle local need and for continued investment in Banbury town centre.”The party said a formal deal with the Liberal Democrats was therefore not possible.
