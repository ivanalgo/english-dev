Darts has soared in popularity since Luke Littler's world tournament success - with a waiting list of young people wanting take up the sport in Staffordshire, a coach says.Shaun Rogers was teaching a handful of children in Longton last year but his Monday night sessions are now way over-subscribed.Mr Rogers has young players travelling from as far afield as Sandbach, Stockport and Nottingham to take up one-to-one tuition."It's gone ballistic this year, to be honest. It grows by the day."
Mr Rogers said he was pleased to see the growing popularity of the sport and believes schools should capitalise on the enthusiasm of young people."I think the maths side of it is obviously massive," he said."The likes of Michael Van Gerwen and Wesley Plaisier, these guys have done darts at school - they've learnt the numbers and the check outs."The young players at his academy agreed with their coach and said their classmates would be keen to get involved."Loads of people at school want to get into it but they have nowhere to go because everywhere's full," said Kaylub, 15.Mr Rogers said he acknowledged the potential for darts to be used as a weapon puts schools off from using them in the classroom.However, he still hopes that schools in Staffordshire - the home of Phil "The Power" Taylor - can get on board with the idea from September.
