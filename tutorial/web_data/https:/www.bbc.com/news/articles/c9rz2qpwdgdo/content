The director of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story has said a mural dedicated to him and the film in his hometown is "better than an Oscar". Gareth Edwards, who hails from Nuneaton, FaceTimed from Los Angeles with the two artists who were making the mural, after his mother spotted it being created.Nathan Parker, who co-created the mural with an artist called Si W, told the BBC that Edwards' mother, Yvonne, had only seen the mural due to an evacuation caused by a bomb threat in the town centre."She saw stormtroopers appearing on the wall so she walked over and introduced herself," Mr Parker said.
"We wanted to do it to celebrate Star Wars Day - May 4 is traditionally Star Wars Day - so we thought we'd paint a nice wall to celebrate the fact that Gareth comes from Nuneaton."Yvonne had tried to FaceTime her son when she first saw the mural on 3 May, but when he did not answer the phone, she returned on Star Wars Day itself so Mr Edwards could see the mural over FaceTime and speak to the artists."He was really pleased with what we'd done so it was really nice, it really made our day," Mr Parker said.
"His friends had told him it was better than getting an award, but he looked at the phone and said that's better than getting an Oscar. He was incredibly humble."Yvonne also gave the two artists signed copies of the concept art books for the film Rogue One.
