Young people in North Yorkshire have been offered free skateboarding lessons thanks to a donation from a bereaved family.Harry Taylor-Robinson, 14, died from acute myeloid leukaemia in 2020 and regularly used the skatepark in Norton-on-Derwent, Malton.His family provided £2,000 to fund lessons from Ryedale Skate School, with a skateboard festival being held on Saturday in memory of Harry.Harry's uncle, Andy Taylor, said his nephew would be "over the moon" that other children could learn the skills he picked up. 
Mr Taylor said Harry loved riding his scooter at the skatepark, adding: "He did it in all weathers, even in the rain and snow.  "He really enjoyed it, the atmosphere and adrenaline of being on the halfpipes and ramps - if he'd lived longer he'd probably have gone further ahead with it."Ryan Swain, who is providing the skateboard lessons and organised the Skatefest event, said: "Harry's family kindly donated some money which we've put into the event, the skatepark and into future lessons.  "If people in the community are interested and want to learn how to use the skatepark safely then they can come and do that for free."
Mr Swain said Skatefest would be a celebration of action sports and culture, featuring live music, demonstations from professional skateboarders and skating workshops.Stanley, 11, who has been skateboarding for six months, said: “I like skating because it’s exhilarating and I like the adrenaline."It's important to me because its something that I can do that makes me happy and I can’t really get bored when I’m doing it."“I like learning new things and new tricks," said 10-year-old Henry."I always come home and show them to my family and friends."
