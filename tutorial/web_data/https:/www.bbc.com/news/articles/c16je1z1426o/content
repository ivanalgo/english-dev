Crowds have turned out to celebrate 20 years of Pride in a Greater Manchester town.The annual LGBTQ+ event returned to Oldham with a parade through the town of mascots and performers led by a samba group.The party continued at Queen Elizabeth Hall with local singers Samm Hewitt and Violet Blonde taking to the stage. Councillor Peter Dean said Oldham Pride had been "a symbol of inclusion, acceptance, and visibility" for two decades.
"The LGBTQ+ community is an integral part of Oldham, and I am delighted that this event is taking place in our town centre," the cabinet member for thriving communities and culture said.“We aim to ensure that everyone who identifies with this community feels included, accepted, and valued."Event organiser, Councillor Louie Hamblett, told BBC North West Tonight: “We’ve tried to put on a big event this year."With music and celebration, with a big parade through the town centre."We want to celebrate how far LGBTQ+ matters have come."He said the town's Pride event 20 years ago was a bit smaller. "Back in 2004 it was a little event outside Oldham Library but now we have lots of traders, homegrown talent on stage and even world famous drag artists," he said.  Singer Nicole Green and country singer, Niall Barnes also performed for the crowds.Learning disability charity Pennine Mencap brought the sounds of their Rhodes Bank choir, along with Gabrielle Gee, the Oldham-born indie folk singer songwriter.
Isaac Quinn, Youth Mayor of Oldham, said it was an important event because the LGBTQ+ community had "largely been marginalised over the last 50 years and now everyone can be themselves and be in parades and they can have that solidarity and show it without fear of being marginalised again". There will be a service at Oldham Parish Church on Sunday, as well as an artisan market and live music at Billingtons to continue Oldham's Pride weekend.
