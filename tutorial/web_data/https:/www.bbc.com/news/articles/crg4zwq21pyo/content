A teenager said it was "a dream come true" that British Superbike star Ryan Vickers gave her a lift to her school prom, after her mother arranged a surprise ride.Scarlett Alexander, 16, was driven to Caistor Hall Hotel in Norwich on the back of a replica OMG Yamaha bike.She said she was stunned that her favourite superbike rider would give up his time for her."I am so amazed and so shockedâ€¦ I have followed him for so many years, I just love it," she said.
Vickers, 25, who is from Thetford, said he was happy to give something back to local fans."It's great," he said. "These people dedicate so much, going all over the country to go and watch. I appreciate the time and money it costs."It's nice to come back and give a little back, and hopefully make Scarlett's day special."Scarlett's mum Sharron was behind the idea after she met the OMG team at one of the British Superbike rounds earlier in the year.She said: "I am so proud of her. She has done amazingly well to get to the end of the school year, and what more could I wish for than BSB rider Ryan Vickers to drop her off at her prom. Absolute dream."She added: "I cannot believe it, I am so grateful and thankful for everyone who has made this happen."
