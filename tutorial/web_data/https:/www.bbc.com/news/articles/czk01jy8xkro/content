All appointments at a dental practice in the south of the Isle of Man have been cancelled following a fire overnight.Manx Care confirmed slots at Port Erin Dental Practice had been scrapped for the “foreseeable future”.It follows a blaze at the surgery on Orchard Road at about 01:00 BST, which was attended by crews from Rushen, Castletown and Douglas.A spokesman for the fire service said flames were “coming out of the windows of the ground floor and cylinders were exploding”, but everyone was evacuated out of the building.
Crews spent about four hours putting out the blaze, checking for spread to adjoining buildings and clearing the property of smoke.Manx Care said it was working closely with the practice, which would "be in touch with their patients in due course with regards to their future appointments”.Patients experiencing pain, bleeding or swelling should contact The Square Dental Practice for an emergency appointment, the healthcare provider added.
