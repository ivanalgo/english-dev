Children at a school in Kenya set up by a Lincolnshire charity will be cheering on  Jude Bellingham and his England team mates as they go up against Spain in the Euro 2024 final.The Miche Bora nursery and primary school in Mombasa is supported by England and Real Madrid star Bellingham.The 21-year-old, from Stourbridge, had been involved since he was 15, said founder Rita Fowler.She said the children were "absolutely bowled over" knowing "someone like Jude was supporting them".
The retired teacher, from Market Deeping, said she and her late husband Geoff had set up the project in one of the most impoverished parts of Kenya after visiting the area on holiday in 2009, and first met the England star about five years ago."His father, Mark, worked with my daughter, and he talked to Jude about our charity and Jude said he wanted to help," she said.She said he knew he was going to have the opportunity to make a difference, adding that it was "obvious at that stage he was going to become quite famous"."I would be very proud if he was my son, and not because of the football, he just cares about other people," she added.
Jude Bellingham previously launched a fundraising campaign to buy laptops for the school.Mrs Fowler said the player had also made a number of "generous donations" and donated his boots to raise money.She said it was unlikely most of the children would be able to watch the game live as it would be late, and it was not safe to be out after dark.However, she said the "football-mad" youngsters would definitely be lending their support to England."They are mad about watching him [Jude Bellingham], and knowing somebody like that is supporting them," she added."It makes a big difference."England take on Spain in the final at 20:00 BST on Sunday.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
