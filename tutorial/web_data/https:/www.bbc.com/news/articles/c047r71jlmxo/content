A family that was cut off by the tide had to be rescued by the RNLI.The lifeboat crew found two adults, three children and two dogs treading water in Fleetwood at about 14:50 BST on Sunday.The charity’s lifeboat was able to locate the group and return them safely to shore, where they were passed into the care of the North West Ambulance Service. Neil Atkinson, who was at the helm of the lifeboat, said: "In situations like this every second counts, and we were fortunate to reach this family when we did."
"It reminds us all to check tide times and stay aware of what’s happening around us, and most importantly to carry a means of calling for help - if you find yourself in danger call 999 and ask for the Coastguard," he said.The crew had been at a service of thanksgiving for 200 years of the RNLI and 165 years of the RNLI in Fleetwood when they were called.
