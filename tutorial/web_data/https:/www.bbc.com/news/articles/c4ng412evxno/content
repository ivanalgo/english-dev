The mayor of Mablethorpe has said a Which? survey on seaside towns that ranked the town second from bottom was “a slap in the face" for the resort.The consumer magazine surveyed more than 4,700 people about their experiences, asking for their views on a range of criteria.Bamburgh in Northumberland took the top spot with a score of 86%. Mablethorpe scored 46% - four percentage points above Bangor in north Wales at the bottom of the table.Skegness received a 48% score, and Cleethorpes 54%.
Which? asked tourists to rate the locations on the quality of the beaches, food and drink offerings, tourist attractions and value for money.Claire Arnold, Mablethorpe’s mayor said the survey was not a “true reflection of what our town has to offer”.She said: “We have a beautiful promenade where people can walk from the coastal town of Mablethorpe right over to Sutton and back again, we've got a free public paddling pool and we've got blue flag beaches.”“It couldn't have come at a worse time because the kids literally just broke up."Ms Arnold pointed out the town has a lot to offer both residents and visitors, highlighting the recent opening of a long-awaited new leisure and learning centre.Ms Arnold added: "It feels like a bit of a slap in the face. It’s heartbreaking."
Some respondents to the survey noted that Mablethorpe felt run down in places, but it drew praise for its “lovely, enormous, clean beach”, with multiple visitors enjoying the traditional atmosphere of the town.One repeat visitor enthused: “It has great character and such a relaxed feeling to it … you just enter into the spirit of the place and it really takes your mind off everyday worries.”Ms Arnold described Mablethorpe as traditional, adding: "We've got the amusement arcades, and bowling, a cinema; there's plenty of family entertainment to be had”.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
