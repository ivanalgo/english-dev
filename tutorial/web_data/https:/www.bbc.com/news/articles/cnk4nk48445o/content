A free advice line that "reassures" those involved in the adult care system is being extended.Over the next two years, Â£136,000 will be invested into Gloucestershire's Care Advice Line, which supports care recipients, as well as their unpaid carers and family members.The telephone line, funded by Gloucestershire County Council, offers people advice and information to address their questions and concerns.Jenny Cooper, the council's head of commissioning for older people, said: "People can feel so lost and they finally feel like they've got someone who can help them find their way through."
Ms Cooper said the care line means people can "actually have a telephone call with a human being"."People feel reassured when they're actually speaking to a person at the other end," she said."If they didn't understand something, the other person can go back and qualify that for them."Ms Cooper said it is hoped there will be an online service in the future, providing recorded information on common topics such as setting up power of attorney.
Ms Cooper said the council has "had almost nothing but positive feedback" regarding the care line over the past eight years."The people on the other end of the call are experts in this field, they have a lot of skills and experience," she added. The care advice line is open between 09:00 and 17:00 BST from Monday to Friday."We're very proud of the service in Gloucestershire. I wouldn't say it's necessarily unique but there aren't very many local authorities that commission this telephone advice line, very often it's an online service," Ms Cooper added."There's a risk otherwise that people might be a bit lost by the system."
