A 16-year-old hammer thrower is aiming to compete in the 2032 Olympics just five years after taking up the sport.Jack Burgess, from Fareham, Hampshire, started throwing the hammer after his PE teacher encouraged him to get into athletics when he was 11.He is now working with the Hampshire Talented Athlete Scheme (HTAS) and is currently ranked third in the UK, and is hoping for a podium spot in this weekend's England Athletics Championships in Birmingham. "I should come out in second place behind the European champion," he said.
Sharon Robertson, of Hampshire and Isle of Wight charity Energise Me which runs HTAS, said it was designed to support up-and-coming athletes."Athletes on a pathway can apply and receive free access to leisure centres and fast-track physio sessions, as well as wrap-around support through fitness testing and nutrition," she said.She said the programme had shown him how training and fitness testing had enabled him to use his body correctly, but added "having naturally long arms has helped"."With hammer [throwing], if you get the first turn right everything will go, and it feels like an art - its amazing," she continued.
Jack said the scheme had also been useful at helping to him overcome the mental challenges associated with competing at the highest level. "Mental health and mindset were a really big challenge for me, and I went to sessions on recovery and setbacks," he said."In a week, I was more confident and able to push through competitions without being worried."Speaking of his hopes for the 2032 Olympics, Jack said age was on his side. "I'll be 24 then," he said. "Most throwers peak in their late to early 30s so I hope to get in there as soon as possible."
