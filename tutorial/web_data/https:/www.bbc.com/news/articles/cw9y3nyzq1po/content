A driving instructor has said he is on a “one man crusade” to improve the quality of the roads around the Surrey town where he teaches his clients.Martin Pitchley said he was “shocked” at the state of the streets around parts of Redhill.He said he has contacted Surrey County Council (SCC) about what he says were "illegible road markings, overgrown hedges blocking speed signs and poor road conditions".A SCC spokesperson said they "appreciate the concerns raised" and they had been in touch with Mr Pitchley to "talk through the issues".
Mr Pitchley said: “It’s not very fair for students taking their test with all these problems which are caused by poor road management by the council.” He told the Local Democracy Reporting Service that a speed sign near a test centre had been knocked over and had been "lying down in a hedge for over six months".He said: "Students who are just about to take their driving test come out of the centre not knowing what the speed limit is on that road."
Mr Pitchley said he was also concerned for pedestrians, cyclists and other vehicles.A SCC highways maintenance officer said vegetation covering road signs will be removed as part of the rural cut back of Earlswood and Reigate South on 19 July. A spokesperson said: “The grass verges in question will be cut as part of our twice per annum rural cuts. “Requests to replace speed signs in the area have been raised, however these need to be prioritised against other requests across the county and officers will review this as soon as they can.”
