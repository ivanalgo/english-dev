For years the Secret Garden Party leaned into its persona as the home of hedonism near Huntingdon.At its peak the festival attracted 35,000 revellers but has been rebranded as a smaller event with a different focus.Founded in 2002 by Freddie Fellowes as an event for friends, it grew in size over the years, but this year has a maximum capacity of 10,000 and is focussing on up-and-coming acts rather than big-name headiners.Fellowes said this year's event - Secret Garden Party: Roots - would be "a much more intimate show".
In 2017, the Cambridgeshire festival had a five-year hiatus, but "Head Gardener" Fellowes could not resist bringing it back in 2022.This year, however, the focus has shifted to support of the grassroots independent music scene, opting to forego large name headline artists in favour of more undiscovered talent. Fellowes said the intention was to hold "a much more intimate show, going back to our original intentions and ideas... really leaning into what we can then do with supporting new talent and giving them the slots they deserve".He added: "I think thereâ€™s a lot of festivals out there and we have to stick to what we do best and what we always did differently."The shift is in response to the pressures both punters and those behind the scenes in the music industry are facing.This year alone, at least 42 festivals have said they cannot go ahead.
By reducing capacity and spending less on big names, Fellowes has banked on not only a loyal established fan base, but a hope that the festival might well unearth future headliners that will return in the years to come.Acts such as New Zealand's Fat Freddy's Drop and drum and bass duo Chase & Status have repeatedly returned.One of the event's regular features is its "secrets", including surprise attendees, revealed through the weekend.
Even in its reduced form, the event still has a few surprises up its sleeve, such the  announcement of Welsh viral star Ren who brings a specially designed show. Beset with health issues, this is his first show in five years and the Anglesey resident has even bought a small amount of day tickets himself to help out fans who might not be able to afford full-price tickets.  In a social media post he said: "Festivals like The Secret Garden Party are integral for the development of independent artists as well as providing a platform of opportunity to grow their audiences."
