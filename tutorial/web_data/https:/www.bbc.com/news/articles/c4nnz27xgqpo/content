A woman who suffered a severe injury while giving birth has described the “turmoil” caused by a six-month delay in diagnosing the problem.Ashley Roper, 37, from Heckmondwike, suffered what is known as a buttonhole tear of her perineum while giving birth at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield in 2017.In total, she needed seven operations over five years to repair the damage, including having a stoma fitted and reversed.The hospital trust which runs Pinderfields has now apologised for the delay in diagnosis, saying aspects of the care Ms Roper received “should have been better”.
Ms Roper underwent surgery immediately after giving birth, but had to be readmitted to hospital four days later with continuing symptoms, including incontinence.At that point, doctors failed to diagnose a gap which had developed in her perineum, instead advising her to carry out pelvic floor exercises and get physiotherapy.She was eventually referred to a colorectal surgeon, six months after she gave birth, who diagnosed the injury as what is known as a rectal buttonhole - a rare injury that occurs when there is a hole between the back passage and the vagina.
Ms Roper said: “The last six years have been the worst six years of my life when they should have been the best six years of my life.""I’ve obviously suffered massively - physically and mentally," she added.“I feel hurt and let down. I think things could have been prevented if I’d have been listened to."Ms Roper said: “Receiving my stoma bag almost broke me. To think childbirth could lead to something like that has just really affected me."
Mid Yorkshire Teaching NHS Trust, which runs Pinderfields Hospital, has admitted a breach of duty relating to the delay in diagnosis and has agreed a settlement.Rebecca Tramaseur, a solicitor with law firm Irwin Mitchell, representing Ms Roper, said: “Ashley was raising her concerns - she knows her own body best - and she was told that was normal.“As a new mum with a new baby, that’s a very new, emotional time for anybody. When you have those distressing symptoms and to be told they’re normal, it adds to that distress.”Ms Roper said she had spoken out to raise awareness for other women in a similar situation.“Push and push if you think there’s something wrong because women need a voice,” she said.“You have to listen to your own gut and, when something is wrong, get somebody to listen to you.”
In 2023, it was revealed that 52 women who suffered third or fourth degree perineal tears between 2020-22 at Pinderfields Hospital did not get appropriate aftercare.Mid Yorkshire Teaching NHS Trust apologised to the women and has offered follow-up appointments.Talib Yaseen, chief nursing officer at the trust, said: “We are incredibly sorry Mrs Roper suffered complications following the birth of her son, and regret to have identified that aspects of her care should have been better. We sincerely wish Mrs Roper all the best for the future.”Ms Yaseen added: "We remain committed to providing the best possible care to our patients, ensuring they receive the right diagnosis and treatment they need to get better. "We take responsibility for our actions and remain dedicated to learning from any shortcomings to continually improve our services."In May 2024, a report by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Birth Trauma called for an overhaul of maternity care in the UK and safe levels of staffing.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
