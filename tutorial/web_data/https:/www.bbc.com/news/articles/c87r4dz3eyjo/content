A school's kitchen has been closed after the discovery of a mouse infestation.South Oxfordshire District Council environmental health officers found a dead mouse amongst pan lids and mouse droppings in food storage areas in an unannounced inspection at Sonning Common Primary School on 15 July.Officers issued a Hygiene Emergency Prohibition Notice, meaning the kitchen had to close and would remain shut until officers deemed the health risk has been removed.Alternative catering arrangements are being made until the school closes for the summer on Wednesday. Head teacher Chris Hirst said they had acted "swiftly" to tackle the issue.
The kitchen, which is operated by Kites Kitchen Limited, previously had a food hygiene rating of five before the routine visit last week.It caters for more than 300 children a day at the primary school and associated pre-school, ranging from two to 11 years old.
Mr Hirst said the school and Kites Kitchen had "acted swiftly and robustly" to tackle the issue "whilst ensuring pupils continue to have access to meals"."Kites Kitchen have complied with all the measures required by environmental health officers and pest control professionals," he said, adding there was "no suggestion" food had been contaminated.He said pest control officers were visiting frequently and the kitchen would be deep cleaned during the summer holidays."We are confident that we will soon be able to operate as normal," he said.Councillor Sam James-Lawrie, cabinet member for environment, said the infestation represented "a serious risk of disease and food poisoning"."Our environmental health officers and litigation lawyers took immediate action on uncovering such high levels of rodent infestation in the school kitchen environment," he said."We will continue to closely monitor the situation until we are satisfied there is no longer a risk at this site."Kites Kitchen has been asked to comment.
