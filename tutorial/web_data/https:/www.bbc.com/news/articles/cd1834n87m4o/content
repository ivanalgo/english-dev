They’re really passionate about it. Having something to look forward to is a really big deal."The team, nicknamed the Legends, meet every week to train and play football.One of the players, Jack, has cerebral palsy: "The clubs around didn’t really accept me for who I was. But this club accepts me for who I am."I also get the exercise as well, which I wasn’t getting before this."
Another player, Ollie, said it had improved his confidence.“ I used to play football when I was little. But I like it with pan-disability because it’s more about fun, really.”They hope to soon play against other disability teams in tournaments across East Yorkshire.The club received a special message of support from Hull City manager, Liam Rosenior.The Tigers boss said he was "excited" about their passion for playing football."Football is for everyone.
