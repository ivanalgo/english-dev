Lidl has withdrawn a controversial planning application for a supermarket in Bath, but said it plans to resubmit the plans in autumn.The supermarket chain was hoping to build a store in Larkhall, next to Bath Rugby's Lambridge training pitch.Residents and environmental groups opposed the application, voicing concerns about the detrimental impacts of the proposed development.Lidl said it will resubmit the plans, once they "are as robust as possible", adding that it remains "fully committed" to opening a new Lidl store in Bath.
Campaigners said the proposed site was "a vital part of Bath's identity"."The area serves as an essential habitat for local wildlife, including endangered species like European beavers, otters, bats, and various bird species," the Bath and North East Somerset Green Group said."The potential disruption posed a serious threat to biodiversity, undermining our efforts to protect these vital ecosystems."
Residents also mentioned concerns about traffic congestion and air quality.National Highways recognised the impact that this site would have on the strategic road network.Local businesses in Larkhall, Batheaston, and along the London Road, said they would also face significant challenges from a large supermarket, jeopardising their vitality and community roles.Lambridge councillor and leader of Bath and North East Somerset Greens, Joanna Wright, said: "We need to support our local shops, which are the heart of our community, a supermarket here would only dilute that support and threaten local livelihoods.“Lidl have withdrawn this application, because they don't want to be seen to lose. "The fight will continue to stop any supermarket being built on this site, what we need is a new vision to ensure this green field site is protected.”A spokesperson for Lidl said: "To ensure that our application is as robust as possible and contains the results of vital highways surveys, we have withdrawn our application with a view to resubmitting it later in the year once we’ve had an opportunity to carry out these surveys. "We look forward to working with the local council on the updated application and to providing further updates to residents in due course."
