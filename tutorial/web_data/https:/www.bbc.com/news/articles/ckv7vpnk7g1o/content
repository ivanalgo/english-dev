A mother whose baby died after medical staff missed opportunities to save her has called for a public inquiry into an NHS trust’s maternity services.Chloe Vowels Lovett’s daughter, Esme, was stillborn at 38 weeks in 2022 after hospital staff dismissed stabbing pains 33 weeks into her pregnancy as normal.“To lose a child when you shouldn’t have lost a child is just unbearable,” she said.The University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust has apologised.
A post-mortem examination and internal investigation at Worthing Hospital found the 29-year-old, who was deemed a high-risk pregnancy, had placenta abruption and polyhydramnios, which increases risk in stillbirth.The findings also said medics missed at least six opportunities to have intervened before Esme’s death, according to law firm CL Medilaw.
Ms Vowels Lovett and her husband, Toby Lovett, from Southwater in West Sussex, are campaigning for an independent review into the trust and urging officials to “listen to mothers”.“There’s a group of us who have now come together who have all lost babies with this particular trust,” Ms Vowels Lovett said.“Meeting these other families, it’s kind of a timeline that proves that changes aren’t happening. So I think pushing for a review, hopefully we’ll force their hand.”The couple were expecting Esme after seven years of trying to conceive and six miscarriages.Robyn and Jonny Davis, from Steyning, are also backing the calls for a public inquiry following the death of their 14-day-old son, Orlando.The trust has apologised, stating that the investigation into Esme’s death had led to improvements in the service.Tim Taylor, of the trust, said since the investigation, it had offered urgent appointments for parents with complex medical issues and launched a centralised telephone triage service.“We have met with Esme’s family to express our deepest condolences and sincere apologies for their devastating loss, and I would like to repeat that apology publicly today,” he added.
