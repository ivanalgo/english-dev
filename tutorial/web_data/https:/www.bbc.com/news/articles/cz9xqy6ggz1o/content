The National Wax Museum in Dublin is "committed" to creating a new wax figure of Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor after significant public backlash.It comes after the museum unveiled a waxwork of the late singer and activist to coincide with the first anniversary of her death.O'Connor was found dead at the age of 56 in her south London home last July.The figure was first unveiled on Thursday as a tribute to the singer, but the museum has now said it will be removed in order to create "a more accurate representation".
Among those who criticised the original figure was O'Connor's brother, John.He said he was shocked when he first saw the waxwork online and said it was "inappropriate"."It looked nothing like her and I thought it was hideous," he told Irish broadcaster RTÉ's Liveline radio programme on Friday.He added that the figure looked "between a mannequin and something out of the Thunderbirds".
A statement from the museum said: "In response to the public's feedback regarding the wax figure, we acknowledge that the current representation did not meet our high standards or the expectations of Sinéad's devoted fans."We have listened closely to the reactions and agree that the figure does not fully capture Sinéad's unique presence and essence as we intended."
The museum said O'Connor's impact on music is "immeasurable" and its goal was to honour the late singer in the "most fitting and respectful manner"."With this in mind, we are committed to creating a new wax figure that better reflect's Sinéad O'Connor's true spirit and iconic image," it added."Our team of skilled artists will begin this project immediately, ensuring that every detail is meticulously crafted to celebrate her legacy appropriately."It said the museum looks forward to unveiling a new figure that "truly honours" O'Connor and her "extraordinary impact".
Sinéad Marie Bernadette O'Connor was born on 8 December 1966 in the affluent Glenageary suburb of Dublin.Her debut album in 1987, The Lion and the Cobra, was a storming success, earning O'Connor a Grammy nomination for best female rock vocal performance.But it was her 1990 Prince cover single Nothing Compares 2 U which saw her catapult to worldwide fame.O'Connor was outspoken on subjects including religion, women's rights and racism.In 1992, she tore up a photo of Pope John Paul II while performing on US television programme Saturday Night Live in protest against child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.
In 2018, she converted to Islam, changing her name to Shuhada Sadaqat. However she continued to perform under her birth name.On 26 July 2023, the musician was found unresponsive at her home in Herne Hill, south London and was later pronounced dead.A coroner ruled that she died of natural causes.
