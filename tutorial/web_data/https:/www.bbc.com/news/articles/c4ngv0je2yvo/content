“No-one should have to lose a child and events this week in London are a sobering reminder of the devastating consequences of knife crime and serious violence," Det Ch Sup Conway said."It tears families apart and robs our children of their futures.“We remain steadfast in our commitment to tackling these crimes and protecting young people across London."
The number of teenagers losing their lives to violence in the capital rose last year, from 14 in 2022, to 21 in 2023, figures show. However, it is a fall since the record number of deaths seen in 2021, when 30 teenagers were killed in London.
