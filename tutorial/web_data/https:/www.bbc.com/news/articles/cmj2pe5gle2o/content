Arrests were made and 13 people dispersed from Exeter city centre during a shoplifting crackdown by police officers dressed in plain clothes.Devon and Cornwall Police said a recent operation "aimed to raise awareness and focus on the issue which causes local shop workers and owners a financial headache". The force said police swapped their uniform for plain clothes to mix in with shoppers.Andrew Sharman, from Exeter Businesses Against Crime (EBAC), said: “The shoplifting action day saw policing at its finest with crime being disrupted."
Police said 13 people were dispersed under public spaces protection order powers, which meant they could not return to the area for a "given period of time".The force said: "Four Police and Criminal Evidence Act searches were carried out for being in possession of stolen goods, two of which were positive.

A third search was also positive but the store decided on taking civil action instead of criminal prosecution."A man was stopped and questioned in relation to selling illegal tobacco on Exeter High Street. The tobacco was seized and the offender was dispersed," police said.
