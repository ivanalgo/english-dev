A recently elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) is seeking the public's views on how to fight crime.Northumbria PCC Susan Dungworth, who was voted in for Labour in May, said she wanted to shape the force's priorities based on what the area's residents wanted.She is running an online survey until 31 August.It covers "key themes" including "fighting and preventing crime, building better systems and improving experiences", Ms Dungworth said.
She added: "I want to be doing everything I can to make our streets safer and our communities stronger. "To achieve this, I need to reach as many people as possible and to listen."So, I really want to encourage people to take just a couple of minutes to complete my short survey."She said the Northumbria force area was "overall a safe place to live and work" but it did have its "challenges"."From anti-social behaviour to violence against women and girls, there remain areas in which we need to see continued progress and there are new challenges we must take on," Ms Dungworth said.
