Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said she has reported a "sinister" threat to her life to police."Last night a threat to kill me was issued online," Ms McDonald posted on social media."The individual said he would shoot me dead."She added the threat "represents an escalation of targeted online abuse" towards her over the last year."It is totally unacceptable," she added. "I have reported this to An Garda Síochána (Irish police force)."The claim "was made to take my life, it was as blatant and blunt as that", she told Irish broadcaster RTÉ.Ms McDonald said the individual also "made a threat against a senior member of An Garda Síochána" - understood by BBC News NI to refer to Commissioner Drew Harris."May I say that is completely unacceptable and I expect that matter will be dealt with as well," Ms McDonald added.TikTok said it had removed the video from the platform.In a statement given to RTÉ, An Garda Síochána said it is "aware of footage posted to social media on Tuesday, 16 July 2024. An Garda Síochána is investigating this matter".
Speaking on social media, Ms McDonald said there was a "vicious, sexist, misogynistic" campaign.She said that these threatening acts "cannot stand" and that they play no part of political conversation."I’m no shrinking violet, I’m not a bit precious about people making all manners of commentary, but I’m drawing the line, I’ve had enough of it quite frankly, I’m upset by it naturally."It’s clearly not going to put my off doing my job and carrying out my democratic function and representing people to the best of my ability," she added.Irish Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee TD, supported Ms McDonald on social media saying she "strongly condemned the threat". "Threats of any nature should never be tolerated in our democracy," she added.
