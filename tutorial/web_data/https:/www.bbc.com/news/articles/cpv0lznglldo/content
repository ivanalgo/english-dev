A university has confirmed that it will be pulling out of its campus in Cheshire by the end of 2026.The University of Buckingham said its teaching activities at the Apollo Buckingham Health Science Campus in Crewe would be relocated to Buckingham over the next two years.The campus launched in 2019 and is run by the university with Indian health education firm Apollo Education UK.The latter has been contacted for a comment on its future at the campus.
Professor James Tooley, vice-chancellor at the University of Buckingham, said concentrating efforts on Buckingham would “create a more cohesive and enriching learning environment”.“This strategic focus enables us to better allocate resources, facilities and faculty expertise, ultimately providing the best possible experience for our students,” he said.“I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all those who have played such a crucial role in the development of our Crewe Campus in recent years.”
He said that its students would still be able to undertake clinical placements at NHS trusts and educational providers in and around Crewe.The university confirmed that some staff would remain in the area to support students on placements but most would be relocated.A spokesperson said it anticipated some positions may “regrettably” be made redundant as a result of the decision.
The campus opened its doors to UK and international students in September 2019.It took over the site that was formerly the Manchester Metropolitan University's Crewe campus.Before that it was the Crewe and Alsager College, which was once attended by Oscar-winning actress Michelle Yeoh.
