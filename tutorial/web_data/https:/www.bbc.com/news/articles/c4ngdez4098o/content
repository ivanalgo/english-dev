Dozens of protestors gathered in Birmingham on Saturday calling on the city's leaders to declare a state of emergency on its roads."No more deaths" were among the signs shown by members of campaign group Better Streets for Birmingham during the demonstration at Old Snow Hill.The group says at least 23 people have died on city roads since June last year and has called for speed limits to be lowered.West Midlands mayor Richard Parker said he would urgently meet with the leader of Birmingham City Council and the region's police and crime commissioner.
"I will also raise the issue with the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, in our meeting next week," he said.The group held up signs demanding safer roads at a pedestrian crossing.In the week leading up to the protest, three people died in collisions in the city."We are currently at a point where those travelling in the UK’s second city aren’t sure whether they will make it home alive," said the group in an open letter.On Friday, West Midlands Police said its goal was to reduce road deaths and serious injury to zero, as part of Vision Zero.It added that it was carrying out focused operations in key areas, tackling speeding, drink and drug driving, using a phone while driving, and not wearing a seatbelt."This is an issue that is blighting our region which is why immediate and unwavering focus is needed," said Mr Parker.
