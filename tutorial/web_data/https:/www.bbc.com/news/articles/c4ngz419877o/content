Traffic has been "flowing smoothly" ahead of the scheduled reopening of a section of the M25 in Surrey, National Highways said.The motorway has been shut between junction 10 (Wisley) and 11 (Chertsey) since 21:00 BST on Friday, and is due to reopen at 06:00 on Monday.It is the third of five weekend closures on the M25 this year which have been rolled out to allow for the construction and installation of a bridge on the western gyratory of the roundabout at junction 10.National Highways said: "We continue to strongly advise drivers to avoid the area where possible, allow plenty of extra time, and to follow the official diversion route – and not their sat navs."
The £317m project, which is due to be completed in the summer of 2025, is expected to increase the number of lanes at junction 10, which is one of the UK’s busiest and most dangerous motorway junctions.Between 4,000 and 6,000 vehicles normally use the M25 between junctions nine, near Leatherhead, and 11, in each direction every hour from 10:00 until 21:00 on weekends.The final two weekend closures will take place later in 2024.
