EasyJet has announced it will be operating from City of Derry Airport for the first time as it introduces two new routes.Flights to and from Edinburgh and Liverpool will operate twice weekly on Mondays and Fridays throughout the year.The airline has said the new flights will provide "stronger domestic connectivity" for its customers between Northern Ireland and key cities in the UK.The new routes will begin on 4 November.
Ali Gayward, easyJet's UK country manager, said the airline was "delighted" to announce the launch from City of Derry airport for the first time this winter."We are proud to be the largest airline in Northern Ireland and by expanding our network we are providing our customers in Northern Ireland even greater choice and UK connectivity, all with great value fares and friendly service, and we look forward to welcoming them on board," she added.
City of Derry Airport's managing director Steve Frazer said it is an“extremely significant step forward” for the airport and the wider north west region.He said these flight routes will be a key economic driver for business investment in the north west and inbound travel and tourism.“This is an operator [easyJet] that has never operated at the airport before and this fills routes that we have been looking to fill for about three or four years.“With easyJet, this has taken about three years to make this happen.”The airport's head of business development, Brenda Morgan MBE, said the new flights will offer connectivity to two key UK airport hubs."Services to Edinburgh and Liverpool have been in demand from both corporate and leisure travellers in the north west," she said."The flight schedule for Mondays and Fridays provides fantastic timings for business travel during the week and weekend breaks for the leisure market.”
President of Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, Greg McCann, said the news was "hugely welcome."He said it "delivers upon the expansion of connectivity that the North West region has long needed.""We look forward to the economic benefits these services will bring and to City of Derry Airport further expanding its offering through further moves," he added.
In January, Derry City and Strabane District Council warned that money from Stormont to help secure City of Derry Airport's long-term future was unlikely this year.The airport is owned by the council and it costs ratepayers £3.45m to help pay operational costs.Previously, the council said they were facing a funding shortfall of about £729,000 for the next financial year.Mr Frazer told BBC Radio Foyle on Thursday they also expect a decision regarding long-term future funding for the airport “in the coming weeks”."I have been involved in the talks and everyone can see the rationale," he said. "Everyone can see the council and the rate payers of Derry City and Strabane have funded the airport for a long period and that needs to shift to central government where the benefits of the whole north west in having the airport and the growth of the region can be achieved. "I think the level of fairness will be achieved and the government will support us."
