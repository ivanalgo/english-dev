Patrols on the River Medway and in Swale have increased by 150% this summer in a bid to stop dangerous and antisocial marine craft.Peel Ports is responsible for the safety on this stretch of water from Allington Lock to the mouth of the Medway at Sheerness, and has been enforcing byelaws since 2022.Jet skis capsizing dinghies, crashing into the seawall, intimidating bridge workers  and endangering swimmers have all been reported since the patrols began.Paul Clarke, harbour enforcement officer for Peel Ports, said: “We just quietly engage with people about safe practices and speed limits on the river here." 
Mr Clarke says the operation has now entered a new phase of enforcement."We will actively prosecute those who are repeat offenders," he said. “We’ve seen users of jet skis unknowingly capsize dinghies and we’ve had to go and rescue individuals from the underside. "There's also been a number of impacts with jet skis hitting other craft and hitting the seawall causing them to sink."
Richard Grad, lead marine operations manager at Pee Ports, says the patrols are now in their third year.“They’ve increased by over 150% in the last three years and have achieved a large reduction in the number of instances of speeding and misuse on the River Medway and Swale.”He says Peel Ports is working with Kent Police to clamp down on antisocial behaviour, with fines reaching £2,000 for those who break the law.Mr Grad says all craft using the water must be registered and that courses are available to those wanting use their jet ski safely."The maximum speed for this stretch of river is 6 knots however there are no restrictions in the open water beyond the marker buoys."
