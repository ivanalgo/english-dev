A hedgehog with a "painfully tight" cable tie around its body has been freed by the GPSCA.Two hedgehogs were found on Sunday by a member of the public who took them to the animal charity.Staff believe the hedgehog with the cable tie is the mother of the healthy juvenile found alongside her.The GPSCA shared photos with a plea for islanders to keep the islands "safe and free from waste".
GSPCA manager Steve Byrne said: "Both, for their size, were in fairly good condition but the larger of the two could barely move due to a cable tie which was extremely tight and making it impossible for ‘Riley’, as the hog has been called, to even roll up let alone move.“We quickly removed the cable tie which was painfully tight and if she hadn’t have been rescued she would have slowly perished.”The GSPCA regularly sees animals injured by human waste, he said.He added that both hedgehogs were doing well and would be released into the wild soon.The animal charity said it had 55 hedgehogs in its care and had rescued 184 this year, bringing the total since 2011 to 6,341.
