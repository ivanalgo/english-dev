A day of workshops to help people communicate "more effectively" with the island's deaf community will promote inclusivity, a charity has said.The Manx Deaf Society (MDS) will teach British Sign Language (BSL) and lipreading on 11 May to mark Deaf Awareness Week.The society has been providing support and services to the deaf community on the Isle of Man since the 1920s. Chief executive Lucy Buxton said deaf people often faced "significant barriers to communication", which could lead to "social isolation, limited employment opportunities, and reduced access to essential services". 
Ms Buxton said: "We hope the sessions will encourage more people to get involved and support the deaf community.""We believe that everyone should have access to the tools and resources they need to communicate effectively, regardless of their hearing ability". "Improving communication is important for members of the public, businesses, and organisations".
The awareness week was "a fantastic opportunity to celebrate the achievements and contributions of the Deaf community and to promote understanding and awareness", Ms Buxton added. Three sessions with 12 places are set to be held at the charity's headquarters on Somerset Road in Douglas.The workshops are for anyone interested in learning more about deaf culture, communication and inclusion, the charity said.MDS also offers deaf awareness training throughout the year for businesses and organisations, alongside a range of BSL courses.
