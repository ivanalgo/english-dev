Calls to ban face coverings in a city in an effort to reduce anti-social behaviour were rejected over concerns the proposals would be “unenforceable”.A motion put forward to Southend-on-Sea City Council at a full council meeting sought to ban the wearing of face coverings on the high street and seafront by groups of youths.The ban would have been part of an update to the city’s public space protection order, but wearing them for health, safety and religious reasons would be allowed.Jack Warren, a Conservative councillor who put forward the motion to the Labour-led authority, said: “No-one needs to wear a ski mask or balaclava in the height of summer. This is about protecting our public spaces for the law abiding majority.”
Councillors in support of the motion citied disorder last summer, when groups of young people filmed themselves engaging in anti-social behaviour in the city and posted it on social media.James Courtenay, a Conservative councillor for Chalkwell, spoke in support of the motion and said: “My inbox was full of people writing to me about anti-social behaviour on the seafront. "Tik Tok was full of videos of people fully masked up causing mayhem on the seafront," he added.
Labour councillors were concerned a ban would not work. Matt Dent, a Labour councillor and the cabinet member for culture, tourism and business, said: “I do have serious doubts over enforceability. "Whilst I am very keen to address anti-social behaviour and retail crime, I don’t think this does anymore then increase the burden on community safety teams."He added: “Anyone challenged could simply say it was for health or religious reasons."After voting down the motion, Daniel Cowan, the Labour council leader, said: “We totally agree with the intention of stopping this behaviour, but not through this motion.”
