A bungalow is set to be converted into a respite care home for young adults with severe disabilities.The eight-bedroom property on Springhill Lane in Lower Penn would offer short-term care, enabling families and carers to take a break from their duties.South Staffordshire Council approved the plans amid 10 objections that highlighted residents' concerns about noise and light pollution, as well as the site’s location along a narrow rural road.But Progress Care Group said it had an excellent record in "maintaining quality care" in small environments. 
Planning permission was previously granted last year for demolition of the property and construction of a replacement home, garage and gym building.But the latest application proposed care for residents ranging from a period of two or three days to a few weeks.Lower Penn ward councillor Victoria Wilson said the application contravened a key policy relating to building in the Green Belt and a change of use had now been considered compared to the previously-allowed development.Dr Neel Barchha, who spoke against the application at Tuesday’s planning committee hearing, said there was no footpath that linked the site to Springhill or Wolverhampton and staff would be arriving and departing by car given a lack of public transport.Bal Dhanoa, chief executive of Progress Care Group, said it was an established provider of care over the last 20 years in the area, with a head office based in Wolverhampton.“In terms of the pavement that is being referred to, our young people are so disabled that they would not be using the pavements without support. "We will invest in and we will have access to transport that is a normal vehicle with mobility access to our homes – that is how we operate all our homes.“We invest in quality areas because we very firmly believe our young people have the right as citizens to live in their communities. They come to us for respite to enable breaks for their parents and carers – this is an essential resource."
