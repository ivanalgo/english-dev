The full demolition of a city pool complex will begin at the end of November and last five months, a council has revealed.Work to prepare the Peterborough Regional Pool in Bishop's Road is already under way and should be complete by April 2025.The timescale was outlined at a full meeting of Peterborough City Council on Wednesday.Councillors were also told they could expect an update on a new facility in the autumn.
The complex has been closed since last year, following a number of problems, including the presence of asbestos, legionella - and the discovery of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete, or Raac.
In March it was decided to permanently close the building, demolish it and build a brand new facility in its place. At the meeting, city council leader Dennis Jones gave an update on the progress. He said that works were already "under way to prepare for demolition" with removal due to "start in late November and finish in April".Mr Jones also said work to provide a new replacement facility is under way.He was asked by Conservative councillor Steve Allen whether there would be a 50m pool and a hydrotherapy facility. Mr Jones responded by saying it was an "aspiration to have those facilities". He said the council was currently working with a leisure company and the options would be presented to the council in the autumn.
