About 1,700 households still do not have power in Cumbria following Storm Isha. Electricity North West said it hoped to restore power to as many households as possible before Storm Joceyln hits the UK later on Tuesday.The firm has been sending support vehicles out across the region to hand out hot meals. Meanwhile, the A66 is shut in both directions between Scotch Corner and the M6 at Penrith to high-sided vehicles, due to strong winds. 
More than 50,000 customers were affected by Storm Isha, according to Electricity North West, with the majority now having their power restored.The firm said it was focused on carrying out repair work "as quickly and as safely as possible" to restore power to the remaining 1,944 properties.There was a risk that some customers may be affected by power cuts until Wednesday due to poor weather, a spokesperson said. There are currently three flood warnings in the county including at the River Rothay at Grasmere in the Lake District as well as 18 flood alerts. Pete Mills from of the Environment Agency, said: "What we can expect is river levels to rise again."We are expecting some flooding in lower lying areas and we've got staff out there on the ground ready to react."He said it was expected that the number of flood warnings and alerts would rise throughout the evening. He also said staff were monitoring water levels at the River Eden. 
The Met Office has issued a yellow wind and rain warning for Tuesday."During the high winds it's unsafe for our colleagues to carry out repairs at height, so it is likely to take longer than usual to restore and repair the network," said Stephanie Trubshaw, a customer director at Electricity North West.Alongside food vans sent across the region, the firm has also been offering hot meals to affected customers in the Plough Inn, Carlisle, and the Crown Inn, Penrith.
