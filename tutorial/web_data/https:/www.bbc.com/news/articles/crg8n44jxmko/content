Highland Council has proposed charging for entry to its Hogmanay celebrations in Inverness this year.The Red Hot Highland Fling has previously been held as a free event.Councillors meeting next week will be asked to approve a charge to generate up to £50,000 to help cover the cost of putting on 31 December celebrations.Officials said other big events run by the council in Inverness - its bonfire and fireworks display and festive lights switch-on, would remain free.
The local authority uses money from the Inverness Common Good Fund for the Hogmanay party, but the council's budget for major public events was cut by 40% in February.Costs of staging the celebrations have also risen, and officials have recommended charging £10 per ticket.Highland Council's Inverness city committee will be asked to approve the plan.Officials said the charge should be affordable to ensure the Red Hot Highland Fling could remain a family event.The celebrations, which usually feature live music and fireworks, could have a capacity of up to 5,000 people this year.Public parks in the city have been used as venues over the years.
