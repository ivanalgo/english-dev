A man who has been sharing pictures of his hometown bins on social media is asking people to vote for their favourite.Andy Bailey from Congleton posts pictures of bins he sees in the town on Instagram, and is running the Bins of Congleton "World Cup".Thirty-two of the most popular have already been whittled down to 16 by his followers, and each has been given a nickname.A red bin leaning to the left is known as Jeremy Cor-bin, while two identical bins fitted back-to-back are The Kray Bins.
The bin tournament is being staged by "popular demand" said Mr Bailey, after "a lot of debate" about which is the best."A lot of people said I was rating the bins unfairly, so I thought, let's throw it back".He rates the bins in a Top Trumps-style, with a maximum score of 25 for the receptacles which impress him the most, and so far he has photographed 82.The hobby began during the lull between Christmas and the new year, when Mr Bailey said he noticed no two bins in his town looked quite the same.
Already knocked out of the world cup are bins with nicknames including Bin Kingsley, Luke Litter-ler and the Bin Reaper.The favourite is looking like the Exter-bin-ator, stated the bin fan, who said the final will be in a "couple of weeks."
