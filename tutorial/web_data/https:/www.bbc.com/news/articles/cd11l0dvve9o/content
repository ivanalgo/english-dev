A baby giraffe at West Midlands Safari Park has taken its first public steps.The calf named Mtembei was born 29 May, with CCTV capturing the special moment.The Rothschild’s giraffe was introduced to the rest of the herd after being snuggled up next to his mum for the first two weeks of his life.The excitable calf has since been seen having "zoomies" - racing around other giraffes who seemed interested in their new family member.
Head keeper of ungulates, Lisa Watkins, said: "He really enjoyed galloping around, having a stretch, and the rest of the herd were very excited to say ‘hello’.“He is starting to show some of his personality, but I have no doubt we will see more of his character now he is exploring his new surroundings. "He’s a relaxed calf and takes everything in his stride, just like his mum, Arusha, who is very attentive.Giraffes are recognised as a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and poaching.The arrival of Mtembei brings the number of giraffes at the park to 11.
