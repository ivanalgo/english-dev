Leasehold flat owners in five Kent tower blocks will be made to pay up to £40,000 each towards the “essential” refurbishment of the buildings.Thanet District Council is improving building safety and energy efficiency at Invicta House, Margate, and Harbour Towers, Kennedy House, Staner Court and Trove Court, in Ramsgate.The council said some of the work is in response to new requirements in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster. It will cost £40m to complete, largely covered by council funds and government grants.Most of the 403 flats are social housing - but 32 are owned by leaseholders, who are being asked to pay the remaining costs.
The council said each leaseholder will pay between £25,000 and £40,000 towards its Tower Block Refurbishment and Retrofit Programme.
“Some of the works we are carrying out are essential for health and safety,” a council officer said.Costs have risen from £19.9m when the project was approved last year to an estimated £40.34m. “Most of the increased costs are due to the external wall system remediation as we have chosen a more expensive system for its improved fire rating, reduced ongoing maintenance requirements and greater durability,” the council officer said.The final cost to each leaseholder will depend on the size of their flat and the number of properties in their block, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.The council's housing revenue account, which includes the leaseholder payments, will cover £11.7m of the cost and the government will pay £28.55m, as well as the cost of the external wall insulation. TDC’s cabinet will make the final decision on the project on Thursday.
