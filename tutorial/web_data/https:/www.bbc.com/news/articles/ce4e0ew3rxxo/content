Police have issued a "risk to life warning" after the seafront and harbour in Stonehaven was closed off following flooding.The Coastguard said teams had been called to assist the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) with reports of flooding at properties in the Aberdeenshire town.And people have been urged to avoid the area.In a statement posted on social media, Police Scotland said: "Members of the public are advised not to enter the piers or attend at Stonehaven Harbour breakwater."Strong winds, surges and an imminent high tide mean that there is a serious risk to life."Access to the harbour is limited, with waves breaking over the sea wall at Shorehead."
Shale and rock from the beach was forced onto the promenade and nearby roads by rising tides on Saturday morning.Walkways and fencing near the harbour have also been damaged by the conditions.A flood warning will remain in place over the weekend, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said.
Aberdeenshire Council said it closed off the area and the nearby harbour on police advice "due to the risk of overtopping waves".“Areas all along the seafront have been affected by coastal flooding overnight," they said in a statement posted online.“With a flood warning in place around high tide today at 1pm, we ask that people avoid the area. ”Images shared by the local authority show rubble scattered around areas near the seafront.The town's flood defences were praised in October last year after holding firm against the rising River Carron during torrential rainfall.
Sepa said a "combination of high tides and prevailing weather conditions" was to blame.The watchdog added: "Flooding from the sea is expected to affect low lying land, roads and properties along the coast in Stonehaven. "Wave overtopping is expected around Cowie Promenade."There is a risk of flooding from waves and spray overtopping to low lying areas of the coast, from Friday evening until Sunday morning."
