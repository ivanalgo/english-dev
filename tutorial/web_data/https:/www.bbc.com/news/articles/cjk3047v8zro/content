A new Aldi store in Epsom could be given the green light after previous plans were rejected by councillors.The supermarket giant submitted an application for the vacant former Dairy Crest site in Alexandra Road in 2015, which included plans for six flats above the store.It was thrown out by councillors over issues including the site's location, the level of car parking available and outdoor space for residents.But Aldi said it had "refined" its proposals in an application which will be decided on by councillors during an Epsom and Ewell Borough Council meeting on Wednesday. 
The new application for the Â£5m development includes car parking but plans for residential units have been scrapped.A council planning committee report on the proposals for the brownfield site said that it had been demonstrated that the development "would be unlikely to result in a severe impact" on local traffic.It also found that the plans would not "result in a significantly adverse impact" on other retailers.
A public consultation on the application received 62 objections including that the site should be prioritised for a green space or housing, and that the development would "allow further urban creep". In public proposals for the store, Aldi said the site "presents a unique opportunity to provide an attractive, bespoke Aldi food store which has been carefully designed to respect the surrounding area".It added that it would "further support the local economy and create new jobs for local people".
