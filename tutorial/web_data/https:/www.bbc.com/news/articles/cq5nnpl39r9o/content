A new railway station and transport interchange could be built in Melton.East Riding of Yorkshire Council has launched a consultation on the proposal, which would also include bus stops and a car park with almost 500 spaces.The Melton Interchange would address "significant capacity issues" at peak times at North Ferriby and Brough stations, according to consultation documents.The area is undergoing significant development, including the construction of an Amazon distribution centre, which is due to bring up to 2,000 jobs to the Melton West business park.
Smith & Nephew is also investing in a £100m facility at Melton West, to replace its plant at Hessle Road in Hull.The interchange, on the Hull to Selby railway line, would be built on land between North Ferriby and Brickyard Lane, with direct access from the A63. It would include 130m (426ft) long railway platforms, suitable for five-car trains, connected by an enclosed bridge, according to the consultation documents.A car park with 497 spaces would be built to the north of the eastbound platform.
Two bus stops would accommodate scheduled services and potential shuttle buses to businesses in the area.Pedestrian and cycle access would be provided via a proposed access road connecting with Brickyard Lane. A public footpath would run to the east of the station.The proposal is being developed in partnership with the Hull & East Yorkshire Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP), National Highways and Wykeland Group, which owns  Melton West.The project offered "high value for money" and bringing it to an "investment ready" stage would maximise the chances of securing funding from the government's Network North transport initiative, according to the consultation documents.Passengers, local people and businesses are being asked to take part in the consultation, which will run until August 12. The station could open in 2027, subject to funding.Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram. Send your story ideas to eastyorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk
