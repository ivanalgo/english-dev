A night shelter that provides food and a place to stay for vulnerable people in Leamington says it faces closure if it cannot find more volunteers.LWS Night Shelter, based at Radford Road Church hall, opens three days a week for the homeless and those in unstable living situations.Because of the lack of volunteers, the not-for-profit organisation has had to either close early or shut completely on some days."It means that we are not a reliable service for the people who need it," said Susan Ruthersford, one of its founders.
"It's upsetting, you feel very guilty," she told the BBC.The shelter is "busier than ever", with about 40 people checking in each night.In June, for example, 111 different people attended and Ms Rutherford said it provides a lifeline for people in the area."This month I imagine it could be higher than [111]," she added.The shelter was founded more than eight years ago, and provides beds for people on Fridays and Saturdays.Hot evening meals are provided from Friday to Sunday, along with breakfasts at the weekend.
The shelter struggles more for volunteers in the summer months, due to people going on holiday, and students moving away. "The Euros haven't helped this summer," she said."There was a weekend in June that we closed the whole weekend."Most roles are two to three hours per shift, you can sign up for as many or as few as you want."Roles include serving and cooking food, welcoming guests, home baking and supermarket collections."We also struggle to get people staying overnight," said Ms Ruthersford."We also just provide company for people. People come down to us for somewhere to feel safe and relaxed."
