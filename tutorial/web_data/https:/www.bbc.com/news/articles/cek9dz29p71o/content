A memorial wall has been unveiled in memory of former police dogs that worked for West Mercia Police.The wall - with more than 50 blue plaques - was unveiled by West Mercia Retired Police Dogs Welfare Fund (PDWF), on Sunday.All the plaques - on show at force headquarters - were paid for by the dogs' handlers or owners, the fund said.Three retired police dogs - TPD Koda, RPD Stevie, and RPD Chase - were in attendance at the unveiling.
The PDWF was set up in 2014 to benefit retired West Mercia dogs that worked for the force.Anyone with a retired police dog that has since died, and would like to purchase a plaque on the wall, should email Jill Byrne at West Mercia Police.
