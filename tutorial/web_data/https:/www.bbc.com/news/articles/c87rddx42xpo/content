A council has taken steps to try to curb "persistent and unreasonable" anti-social behaviour. Residents in part of Eynesbury, near St Neots, Cambridgeshire, have been left feeling "scared and intimidated", according to a report prepared for Huntingdonshire District Council.It said behaviour they had faced included "public intoxication" and "camping on public land without permission".Councillors at a licensing protection committee voted to introduce a Public Space Protection Order (PSPO), which will make certain actions in the area it covers a criminal offence.
Anyone who breaches the PSPO could be issued with a £100 fine, or be prosecuted and face a potential maximum fine of £1,000.Councillors were told the PSPO, which will be in place for three years, would act as a deterrent. Council officers told the committee the behaviour had been linked to temporary residents of a hotel being used by a number of councils to provide temporary accommodation.Officers said the council had been working directly with the hotel's owners, which had taken action and evicted some people whose behaviour had "not been acceptable".Councillors asked for an update on the PSPO's impact to be given at their next committee meeting.
