Former deputy prime minister and Labour veteran John Prescott has ceased to be a member of the House of Lords, marking the end of a parliamentary career stretching back more than 50 years.Lord Prescott had only spoken once in the chamber since suffering a stroke in 2019, and according to official records had not voted since February 2023.The 86-year-old was first elected as MP for Hull East in 1970 and went on to hold the seat for almost 40 years.The former trade union activist served 10 years as Tony Blair's deputy prime minister after Labour's 1997 general election landslide.
He remained in the Commons until 2010 when he joined the Lords.Lord Prescott was dubbed "two Jags" in the press after it emerged he had two official Jaguar cars.He was once criticised for using one of his cars to drive "200 yards".He also famously punched a man who had thrown an egg at him while on the campaign trail in North Wales in 2001."John is John," Mr Blair said the following day, after pictures of the scuffle featured in the press around the world.
While a loyal supporter of Mr Blair in office, Lord Prescott was subsequently critical of Britain's involvement in the Iraq War.He also strongly defended Jeremy Corbyn during his time as party leader.Lord Prescott was among a number of peers who Lord Speaker Lord McFall of Alcluith declared on Wednesday "had ceased to be members of the House by virtue of non-attendance in the last session of Parliament".He said: "In so doing, I should like to thank all the noble lords and baronesses for their many years of service to the House and Parliament."Others whose membership ended due to non-attendance included former media mogul Lord Black of Crossharbour.Lord McFall also announced the retirement from the House of bestselling novelist Lord Archer of Weston-super-Mare.Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
