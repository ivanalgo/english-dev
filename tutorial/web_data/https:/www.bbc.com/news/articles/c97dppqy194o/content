A university has suspended a student group while it investigates a video that appears to show members dancing to a Nazi marching song.The University of Warwick described the video, which was shared on social media and in the media, as  "reprehensible" and launched an inquiry.The University of Warwick Conservative Association (UWCA) has apologised over the footage, which apparently shows attendees at a dinner it hosted dancing to Erika, a popular World War Two song for Nazi soldiers."Antisemitism has no place on our campus," a university spokesperson said.
"Warwick SU has suspended the activities of Warwick Conservative Association while the investigation is carried out."As dinner attendees dance while the music plays, shouts of "sehr gut" - German for "very good" - can be heard on the video.
The UWCA has apologised for the hurt caused by the incident and said the song was requested by an individual who would be barred from future events.In a statement, the group added most attendees had been unaware of the song's connotations, and it would fully cooperate with the university's investigation.It also pointed out its members had consistently campaigned on campus against antisemitism and would continue to stand against discrimination.The Union of Jewish Students previously said the gathering’s "blatant and unchallenged support for Nazism" was "utterly abhorrent" and that it expected decisive action on the matter.“Glorification of the Nazis has no place in our society,” they said, adding “it is in no way acceptable and must be widely condemned”.
The university said its externally-led investigation could take up to 90 days, with findings shared publicly. "Should appropriate action be necessary following the conclusion of the investigation, we will not hesitate to act," the spokesperson added.
