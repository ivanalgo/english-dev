A school has renamed one of its buildings in the memory of a former head teacher who died in France earlier this year.Simon Gibbs was the head at New Rickstones Academy in Witham, Essex, and he died while on a trip with his friends in February.Students, staff and Mr Gibbs' family gathered to rename one of the school's multi-purpose buildings after him.The building was originally opened by Mr Gibbs in 2022 and the school said it was fitting to dedicate it to him.
The Simon Gibbs Building is a block containing classrooms used to teach an array of subjects and it also has a canteen.A spokesperson for the school said the unveiling ceremony was a celebration of the head teacher and his life and achievements.His widow Thea Gibbs said: "It was such an honour to be included in this celebration of Simon. "It is quite overwhelming to see his name on the building... it means a bit of him will still be here."A plaque was also unveiled by Mrs Gibbs and her children.Pupils gave speeches during the ceremony and Olive from Year 11 said: "Mr Gibbs told us over and over again to do the right thing when nobody is watching."We are forever grateful for everything he has done for this school and for what the school is doing in his honour."
Kath Bellchambers, who will be head of school from September, said: "Simonâ€™s impact extended far beyond the classroom walls as he worked tirelessly to build a strong community anchored in the values of respect, integrity and excellence."It seems right that after all the work he put into the project, the building will be named after him."The school has previously said Mr Gibbs' death was an accident.
