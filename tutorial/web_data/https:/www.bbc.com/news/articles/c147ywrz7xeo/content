A colourful art installation of dozens of suspended umbrellas aims to champion the "unique ways" people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, dyslexia and dyspraxia, see the world.The Neurodiversity Umbrella Project will hang above Queen's Road in Watford, Hertfordshire, from 27 July to 27 September. Debbie Wood, from ADD-vance, a Hertfordshire charity that supports families of children affected by ADHD and autism, said the display was to "showcase how we can help improve inclusivity". Watford Town Centre BID, who helped organise the installation, said the umbrellas represented "all the different minds we have here in our community".
Ms Wood, the charity's chief executive officer, said: "The colourful installation supports the aim of our community to change perceptions and champion our unique ways of seeing the world."It was "an important opportunity to showcase how we can help improve inclusivity and recognition within our local communities and beyond".The display represents "the one in five of us who have a neurodevelopmental condition, such as ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia or Touretteâ€™s syndrome", organisers said.Neurodiversity is a term used to describe the naturally occurring variations of the human brain; different human cognitive capabilities that are expressed through unique talents, intelligence and the ability to think differently, Watford BID added. The project, introduced by the ADHD Foundation, has previously been seen in number of places including Liverpool, Cardiff and Aberdeen.
Kara Mesiano, the manager of Watford Town Centre BID, said: "Our aim is to change the perception of neurodiverse [and] neurodivergent people and celebrate all the many strengths that come from thinking differently in our town."The organisation will also be offering support and training to employers who are thinking about hiring individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions, to see it as a "great opportunity" and not a "challenge", she added.From 10:00 BST on Saturday, a performance will take place on Queen's Road, featuring stilt walkers and dancers, to officially open the installation.
