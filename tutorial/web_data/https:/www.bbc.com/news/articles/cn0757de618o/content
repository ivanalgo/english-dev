Folajimi Apartments, on Alexis Street in south Bermondsey, have been named in his honour.Of the 56 flats, 26 are owned by Southwark Council.Mr Olubunmi-Adewole's family and local councillors, including Helen Dennis, attended the official opening this week, with Ms Dennis describing the event as "a great honour".In a post on X, formally Twitter, she added that "Jimi was such a brave young man and we hope these new homes will be a fitting tribute to his heroism life".
At the inquest into Mr Olubunmi-Adewole's death, the coroner said: "The courage to jump to help a complete stranger in the Thames at night is quite astonishing."Many of us would like to think we would do the same in that situation, but few of us would have the courage and determination."
