A summer campaign aimed at reducing the number of dog attacks on Merseyside has been launched.Merseyside Police said there were 469 injuries involving dogs last year, up by more than 21% on the year before.Public Space Protection Orders (PSPOs) are in place at 11 parks in Sefton in a bid to make them safer.Sefton councillor Peter Harvey said: “Our dog control zones are designed to ensure that dogs and humans enjoy these spaces in harmony."
In the dog control zones, owners must ensure pets are kept on a lead in certain areas and kept out of prohibited areas, including children's playgrounds and sports pitches.   Temp Ch Insp Jordan Quinn, said the move meant "all residents and visitors, whether they own a dog or not" could "enjoy Sefton's parks and open spaces safely".“The PSPOs by Sefton Council were a welcome measure to tackle out of control dogs," he said.
He said the zones were part of ongoing work to educate dog owners, of any breed, about the consequences, if they allow their pet to be out of control in a public space.  Mr Harvey said it was important dog owners "stick to the rules so that everyone – especially children – can enjoy our greenspaces safely and without fear". "In some areas, dogs must be kept on a lead. In others, dogs are not allowed," he said. Most owners understand and follow the PSPO for dogs however a "minority" do not and they can expect to be fined, he said.  The Take the Lead campaign was first run in 2023 and the current PSPO was approved by Sefton Council in April 2024 and is set to run until April 2027.
