"Really important" play equipment is being funded by local businesses as a school's budget "barely covers essentials". Employees at Ontic Cleeve and Enterprise plan to walk 10 miles in September to raise money to buy a Scrapstore PlayPod for Stonehouse Park Federation school.Executive headteacher Lisa Jones said the school often had to rely on the "fabulous" Parent Teacher Association and charities to afford play equipment and library books. "Although income looks at a similar level it has to stretch much, much further to meet need," said Ms Jones.
"The opportunity for creative play is a really important part of a childâ€™s day in school."We want our children to be able to use their imagination when out on the playground creating their own games and developing their social skills together," Ms Jones added.
The planned 10-mile circular route will take place on 18 September from Bourton-on-the-Water along the Cotswold Way. Ontic Cleeve and Enterprise also plan to host a cake sale and bingo in August to help raise funds.Ontic employee, Laurie Brazington, said her son who attends the school has possible neurodiversity symptoms and struggles to communicate with others. She believes the new equipment will help her son to communicate with others as it will "bring pupils together through creative play". "The playpod isn't just for those who are neurodiverse but for everyone - I think it will be such a wonderful thing for the school," she said.PlayPods are made up of scrap materials such as cardboard tubes, tyres and netting, and are used by pupils during their lunch breaks.
