A total of £6m has been raised in memory of inspirational teenager Stephen Sutton, the Teenage Cancer Trust announced on the 10th anniversary of his death.His mother Jane Sutton said there remained a “Stephen-shaped hole” in her heart but she was “incredibly proud” of her son and all he had achieved.Stephen, of Burntwood, Staffordshire, died on 14 May, 2014, after having bowel cancer for four years.The 19-year-old’s positivity in the face of incurable cancer captured the hearts of people around the world.
He drew up a bucket list of 46 things he wanted to achieve, including playing drums at a Wembley Cup final, skydiving and hugging an elephant.But top of the list was raising money for the Teenage Cancer Trust, which supported him during his four years of treatment.
Stephen’s Story went viral on social media when he posted what he thought was his last “thumbs up” photo from his hospital bed, on 22 April 2014.“He just connected with so many people,” said Mrs Sutton.By the time he died he had raised £3m.On the 10th anniversary of his death that amount has now doubled, thanks to the continued fundraising in his name.Kate Collins, chief executive of the charity, described it as a “remarkable achievement”.She added: “Stephen talked about not wanting to measure life in terms of time, but in terms of the difference you’re able to make, and he made the most enormous difference."
The money has helped fund 28 specialist wards for young people with cancer across the UK.Stephen was supported by three Teenage Cancer Trust units in Birmingham - at the children’s hospital, Royal Orthopaedic and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.The units are designed for young people and mean they can be treated around others their own age.The trust predicts the numbers of young people diagnosed with cancer in the UK are set to increase from seven a day to closer to 10 a day by 2030.With that in mind, Mrs Sutton is continuing her fundraising efforts.
She has already run the London Marathon; set a world record for the most tandem skydives in 24 hours and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.But she has now announced 16 new challenges which will take place around the UK.The first of which will see her reunited with Sutton the elephant, named after Stephen.
She will be taking part in an elephant poo shovelling challenge, at Noah’s Art Zoo Farm, in Bristol, on 22 May.“It’s all about that message that Stephen gave us, live for the moment, make the most of every minute”, she said.
Stephen’s legacy is also visible in his home town of Burntwood.Every year it turns yellow on the anniversary of his death.This year the school he attended, Chase Terrace Academy, has tied 300 yellow bows to its gates.They can also been seen on lampposts, trees and outside homes and businesses across the town.Jane said it was “heart-warming” to see the outpouring of love and support for her son.
Stephen’s friend, Lee Woodward, who fundraised with him and continues to fundraise in his name said people "haven’t forgotten the life lessons he gave us all”.Describing it as the “Stephen Sutton effect”, he said those who met him and heard his story “just wanted to help”.Reflecting on his short friendship with Stephen, he said: "My life was improved by meeting Stephen."He made me recalculate my values and realise what was truly important."
