Bradford's National Science and Media Museum will reopen in January 2025.The museum has been closed since last summer for a "once-in-a-generation" refurbishment. It had been due to open its doors to the public again this year but that was delayed due to the works taking longer than expected. A spokesperson for the museum confirmed that the venue's reopening would coincide with the start of Bradford's year as the UK City of Culture.
The museum, which opened in 1983, has had a new lift installed and improvements made to the front entrance.Two new exhibitions are also being created as part of a Â£6m project and are due to open later in 2025. The Sound and Vision Galleries, located on levels three and five, will "completely transform" the visitor experience, the museum director said earlier this year. Speaking in April, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said: "Our new gallery designs reveal how the spaces will be dynamic, interactive and inspiring, underlining how all areas of our collection from photography to videogaming are embedded in every aspect of our lives."      Meanwhile, a reopening date for the Pictureville Cinema, which is located at the same site, is expected to be confirmed soon. The cinema has been shut since last October after crumbling concrete was found within the building.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
