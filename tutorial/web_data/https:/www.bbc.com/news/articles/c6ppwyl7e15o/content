A group of "guerrilla" crochet artists have decorated postboxes across a seaside town in honour of the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Southport Hookers knitted a series of themed postbox toppers and have placed them around the town. The toppers include crochet models of soldiers in uniform, a Lancaster bomber and a tank ahead of the anniversary on Thursday. One topper, on Lord Street, was inspired by local D-Day veteran Harry Howorth, who died recently aged 102. 
Suzanne Goatcher, a member of the group, said it had spoken to the Southport Royal British Legion who put them in touch with the families of Mr Howorth and another local veteran, Eric Suchland. Ms Goatcher said: "We told [Mr Howorth] about the topper before he passed away and he was thrilled. "We had already made it when he died so we checked with his family to ask if we could still display it. "His granddaughter has seen the pictures on our page and is made up."She added that the 25-strong team of crochet artists hoped their toppers could "play a part in remembering those who fought and encourage children to ask questions.‚ÄùThe group said each topper took around three weeks to make. There are three on Lord Street Northern Quarter, others on Hillside Bridge, Churchtown Lights, Norwood Avenue and Rufford Road.
