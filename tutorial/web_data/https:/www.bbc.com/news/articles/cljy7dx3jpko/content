A man has been jailed for 11 years after being found guilty of sexually assaulting a young girl.Asuk Hussain, 53, from Dewsbury, was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court on Friday.West Yorkshire Police said Hussain had seen the victim in her school uniform prior to the attack and then took advantage of her when she needed somewhere to stay.Det Ch Insp Oliver Coates said he hoped the victim could “take some satisfaction” from the sentencing.
“Leeds Crown Court heard that Asuk Hussain was aware of his victim’s vulnerability and took full advantage of her for his own sexual gratification," he said.“She was forced to relive this ordeal through a trial, but I hope she can take some satisfaction from seeing Hussain sentenced for his crimes.“We continue to urge any victims of sexual assault who may not have reported what happened to them to contact us.”Hussain had also previously been found guilty of raping a victim who was only 13 in an incident which took place in the Kirklees area in 2004.
His sentencing makes him the 26th man to be sentenced as part of West Yorkshire Police’s Operation Tourway, a multi-year investigation into the non-recent sexual exploitation of young females in North Kirklees.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
