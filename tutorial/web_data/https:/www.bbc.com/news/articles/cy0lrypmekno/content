A new X-ray machine room has been officially opened following a ten year fundraising campaign. The modern facility at Aldeburgh Community Hospital, in Suffolk, was built using a  gift of £320,000 from the League of Friends to Colchester and Ipswich Hospitals Charity. East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust (ESNEFT) said the new X-ray machine used the latest digital technology and had replaced an ageing device, which was installed in 1996. The League of Friends said it was very grateful to "our generous supporters who enable us to keep our local hospital up-to-date".
Sandra Chandler, from Tunstall, was the first patient to use the machine. She said without it she would have faced a 30-minute, 28-mile round trip to Ipswich Hospital to have an X-ray on her pelvis.Ms Chandler added: "I’m so glad I’ve been able to come here. It means I don’t have to travel all the way to Ipswich, saving time and money. It is so convenient."Tony Bone, the president of Aldeburgh Hospital League of Friends, said: “We are very pleased to be able to fund this replacement of the X-ray machine at Aldeburgh Hospital, having funded the original machine more then 20 years ago.  "Having diagnostic testing close to the community makes a huge difference and avoids trips of 20 miles or more into Ipswich."Karen Lough, the director of operations at ESNEFT, said: "We are delighted with the new X-ray machine, which will make a big difference to local people and help us further improve the care we are able to provide."Mandy Jordan, the associate director for charities and voluntary services with ESNEFT, said: "We would like to say a big thank you to the League of Friends for their generosity. Their kindness will make a big difference to local people by helping to make sure they can benefit from the latest technology close to home."
