A former wrestler has swapped headlocks and takedowns for weddings and baptisms after being ordained at Canterbury Cathedral.The Rev Steven Horne, 43, from Ashford, is among a new cohort of deacons and priests ordained by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Dover last month.He told BBC Radio Kent that he had been drawn to the sport as "escapism" after growing up "in quite a tough environment".But he said he decided to switch his wrestling singlet for a dalmatic after getting a "call" from God in 2022. 
"I've always had a strong relationship with God, ever since I was a young child," said Dr Horne.He also previously worked as a police officer before undertaking a PhD in theology, during which time he joined local club South East Professional Wrestling.He told the BBC he appeared at his first event in 2016 as an amateur, before going on to compete hundreds of times.
He said there was a "parallel" between allegedly fixed wrestling matches, where the "middle bit" was "put together by the wrestlers" and his faith."Life can be difficult and sometimes unpredictable, but I rest comfortably knowing that although life is full of slams and suplexes, God has oversight of it all and knows what the end will be," he added.But Dr Horne added that he had been "waiting for the green light from God" to be ordained for ministry."I had heard that particular call very distinctly... on 30 December 2022 and the next day I popped an email off and the process for discernment started two months later," he said.
