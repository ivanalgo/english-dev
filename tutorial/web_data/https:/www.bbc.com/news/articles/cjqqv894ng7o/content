New classes on Romanian culture, history and language are set to start in Jersey next month.The aim is for them to help Romanian children better understand their heritage as well as teach others about what it means to be Romanian.The Romanian Language, Culture and Civilisation course has been funded by the Romanian government and provided by the Romanian Linguistic Institute in Bucharest.The programme is free to attend for youngsters aged between three and 18-years-old.
Corina Ungurusan, who is the key worker lead at d'Auvergne School, will be teaching the classes.She gave a presentation to members of the Romanian community, the Consul General of Romania in London and the Minister for Education and Lifelong Learning on Saturday.Ms Ungurusan said the island was “fortunate” to have the programme with the help of Plat Douet Primary School where it will be taught.“This isn’t just for Romanian children, it is for children of all nationalities because it is always good to learn about different cultures and languages as well,” she added.
It is estimated there are about 2,000 people of Romanian heritage in Jersey.Robert Marin, the Consul General of Romania in London, said the community in Jersey was “vibrant and contributing to the economy” and Romania was looking to “expand our relationship” with the island.“We’ve been exploring different opportunities of expansion with the Government of Jersey and it is one of the best relationships we can see developing with Romanian nationals living aboard.”
Minister for Education and Lifelong Learning, Deputy Rob Ward, attended the event on Saturday to learn more about the classes.He said it was “really important to engage with the wide range of communities in our schools” and the island “punches above our weight” when it comes to integration in education.“This isn't a cost to the government and what it does is enriches what we have in the island so that’s an advantage we have to take.”
