Children with special educational needs (SEND) will face disruption to their education after further strike action was announced at an East Yorkshire school.Members of the National Education Union (NEU) at St Anne's School and Sixth Form College, in Hessle, will stage 12 days of walkouts starting on Tuesday 25 June.It follows strike action in April when teaching assistants and other workers claimed a new pay system did not cover their extra duties.Merlin Joseph, the director of children’s services at East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the authority was trying to "find a resolution" to avoid strike action.
Ms Joseph added: "We do not want children to be out of school, and we have requested mediation takes place rather than strike action."Our absolute priority is the safety of children, and if the school cannot operate safely we support their decision to close on the proposed strike days".The council said the new terms were voted on by union members and accepted.The proposed dates for the strikes are 25, 26, 27, 28 June and 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18 July.One parent, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC they were angry at the situation and said it had been "going on too long".They said: "This is unacceptable. Our children need consistency and this all adds to the stress. It is hard enough being a parent with a child who has complex needs without this."Having so many strike days so close together and so close to the summer holidays doesn’t help. It will have a negative impact on children who need routine the most."In a letter sent to parents, headteacher Hendi Longman apologised because the school, which also provides residential care, will be closed as a result of the action.She wrote: "I am so sorry that you will have to make alternative arrangements for your child at short notice and that they will experience disruption to their education."
The NEU said the previous pay structure, before 1 April, helped retain SEND staff and covered extra work and risks not faced by staff in mainstream settings.Steve Scott, the joint branch secretary for East Yorkshire, told the BBC the union was "really sorry" for the stress the situation would cause for parents."We'll do everything we can to end this dispute and we want to have meaningful talks with the authority as soon as we can".Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
