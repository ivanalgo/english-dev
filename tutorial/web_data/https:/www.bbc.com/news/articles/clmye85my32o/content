A developer has appealed against a £10,000 fine it received for failing to clear up fly-tipping outside a former Leicestershire pub.Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council prosecuted landowner Regis Development Group Ltd over household mess and rubble dumped at the former King William IV in Earl Shilton.The firm admitted failing to comply with a order to clear and secure the site at Leicester Magistrates' Court in October.However, at an appeal hearing at Leicester Crown Court on Friday, it argued its  punishment had been "manifestly excessive".
The court heard the council received a complaint about the state of the land, in The Hollow, from a member of the public in August 2022.There was a skip overflowing with household waste at the rear of the building, dumped kitchen appliances, beer kegs, pallets and broken plasterboard.Danielle St. Clair, representing the council, said the company based in Gower Street, Leicester, was repeatedly instructed to clear the area but had done nothing by 19 September.It was further warned to remove the waste by 4 November.
Ms St. Clair said the company did fit a gate to secure the site but had not moved the tipping by August 2023."Not only had the waste not been cleared but there was a deterioration," she told the hearing.She said the council was concerned the waste would be a danger to members of the public accessing the site.Akaal Sidhu, representing the company, said: "It is accepted by Regis Developments that they acted rather slowly and they know they did not comply with the community protection notice."He said one of the firm's bosses had suffered a family bereavement and the matter had "drifted", but that they felt they had done all they could do at the time.Mr Sidhu said the company was struggling at the time, and had not made any profit on its redevelopment of the pub.
Recorder William Douglas-Jones decided to reduce the fine to £8,000.He said: "There were months at time when nothing was done."However he accepted the company, formed in 2019, was in its infancy and that it had not itself been responsible for the tipping.Follow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
