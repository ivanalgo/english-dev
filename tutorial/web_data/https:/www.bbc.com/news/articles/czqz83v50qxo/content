A Kent father said he had to move out of his own bedroom due to a problem with mould.Mark Deacon, whose flat is in Etchinghill, said he was concerned about the mould affecting his son's breathing.He said they now have to sleep in the same room due to the problems.A spokesperson for Folkestone & Hythe District Council said: "Whilst we are not able to comment on individual circumstances, we are fully aware of the issues Mr Deacon has raised and we continue to investigate these."
Mr Deacon said he had repeatedly complained to the council about the mould over the past three years.  He said the council had made some repairs but the mould kept reappearing because there was a "serious underlying issue".Speaking to Politics South East, he said: "Every morning I wake up and open all the windows, air the place, wipe the condensation. It’s dripping down - it’s soaking wet."I'd just like to have a home me and my son don't dread having to go back to."
The government is proposing to make it a legal requirement for social landlords to investigate hazards within 14 days, start fixing them within a further seven and make emergency repairs within 24 hours.The council spokesperson added: "Council surveyors have visited the property on numerous occasions and the council have carried out extensive works, including corrective measures to rectify the mould issues, and dehumidifiers have been supplied to Mr Deacon. "Further works are booked for this week."
