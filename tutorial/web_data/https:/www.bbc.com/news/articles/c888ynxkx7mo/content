More than 200 businesses have signed up to a new breastfeeding scheme in North Somerset.Run by North Somerset Council, the scheme highlights public spaces where women can comfortably breastfeed.Businesses taking part will display a Breastfeeding Welcome sticker on their window and will make sure their staff are extra supportive of breastfeeding.Katrina James, a volunteer peer supporter at Cafe MAMMA, said the move will help give breastfeeding mothers "confidence".
"This kind of support throughout the community has a direct effect on breastfeeding rates and therefore the health outcomes of our local mothers and babies," she added.Parents can find an interactive list of businesses involved on the Better Health North Somerset website, where businesses can also apply to take part in the scheme.The Breastfeeding North Somerset team also has an Instagram account where they regularly post updates about welcome venues, groups and events.“Breastfeeding has many benefits for both mum and baby," said Matt Lenny, North Somerset Council's director for public health."We know from our data that nearly 80 per cent of new mums in North Somerset start off breastfeeding but many find it more difficult when they’re out and about, away from home, shopping or visiting cafes and restaurants."Mums should never be made to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding in public. "Our Breastfeeding Welcome scheme gives an extra layer of reassurance knowing that the venue you’re visiting is signed up to the scheme and fully supportive of breastfeeding in all public areas of their business."
The scheme has been welcomed by restaurant chain Lounges.Gagandeep Gill, kitchen operation manager explained why it is important for them to support this scheme."We love supporting local families and having the sticker displayed in the window lets parents know they are welcome to breastfeed in our Lounges.”
