A drunk driver who knocked down a pedestrian in north London while speeding on the wrong side of the road has been convicted of causing death by dangerous driving.Javier Salazar, 40, had already crashed into another vehicle with his van when he hit Derek Kernan, 62, in Tottenham in June 2022.Mr Kernan was thrown "some distance" by the impact and died from head injuries.Salazar, who had been drinking beer, tequila and wine at a party, did not stop at the scene.
A jury at the Old Bailey heard Mr Kernan had just got off a bus on his way home and had nearly reached the other side of Northumberland Road when he was stuck by Salazar's van. A member of the public flagged down police to direct them to the van, which had been abandoned nearby.The court was told that Salazar, who is married with three children, smelled strongly of alcohol and that when he was told the man had died had appeared “nonplussed” and replied: “OK". During the trial he said: “I feel really bad. I have my own family and it would be very painful if that happened. "I am really sorry for everything that has happened.”Following the guilty verdict, Judge Alexia Durran disqualified Salazar from driving and remanded him in custody.She adjourned sentencing until Wednesday, saying the jail term he will receive would be likely to be “marked in double figures”.
