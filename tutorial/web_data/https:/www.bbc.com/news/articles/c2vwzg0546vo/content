A former East Sussex railway line is set to be transformed into a cycle route, if proposals are given the go ahead by council leaders.Next Wednesday, Wealden District Council will consider if officers can look into creating a nine-mile walking and cycle route between Uckfield and Lewes.The route is expected to run along the former railway line and also take in Isfield, Barcombe Mills and Hamsey.In a report to a council committee, an officer said: "It could link the two towns whilst providing a new green space corridor."
The report highlighted that if "correctly done" the cycling route - known as a Greenway - could boost the local economy, provide travel opportunities and increase outdoor recreational facilities.A "scoping exercise" would see surveys being carried out to identify the best route, while talks are held with landowners. Investigations will also be launched into planning, environmental and budgeting matters.Wealden officers have discussed the project with Lewes District Council, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.The estimated cost for the exercise is “up to £15,000” for each authority, according to the report.
