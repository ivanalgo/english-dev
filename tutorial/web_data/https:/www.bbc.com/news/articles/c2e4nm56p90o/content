Musical theatre star Alfie Boe is to unveil a rose in memory of his father to raise funds for brain tumour research.The Alfred Robert Boe rose, which is being launched at the Hampton Court Flower Show later, is named after Boe's father, who died from a brain tumour in 1997. Boe, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, has previously voiced concerns that there have been "so few advances" in the treatment of brain tumours, nearly three decades on from his father's death.The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.
The award-winning tenor told BBC Radio Lancashire that brain tumour research needed more government funding to make progress.He said it was "shameful" that brain tumour research got "short changed" when it came to funding, saying it was the biggest killer of people under 40.While brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of 40 than any other cancer, just one per cent of the national spend on cancer research has been allocated to this form of the disease, according to Brain Tumour Research.Alfie Boe was 23 when his father died aged 63, 10 months after his diagnosis."It was absolutely devastating. It really was. It was hard, a horrific thing to go through and to see his decline," he said.
Paying tribute to his father and speaking about how fitting it was to have a rose named after him, the opera singer said: "He was laughter, he was light, he was love, he was fun. He loved his gardening. "He loved getting in the garden and planting a rose." The Rose Alfred Robert Boe is being sold by Harkness Roses, with money raised going to Brain Tumour Research.
