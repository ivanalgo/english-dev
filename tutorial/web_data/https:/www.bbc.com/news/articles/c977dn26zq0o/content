Palestine Action claimed responsibility via X, saying Barclays had links to Israeli defence manufacturer Elbit.In a statement on its website, Barclays says: "It is not true that we have made a decision to invest in Elbit."We may hold shares in relation to client driven transactions, which is why we appear on the share register, but we are not investors."We note also that Elbit is highlighted because campaigners claim it makes cluster bombs."We would cease any relationship with any business where we saw evidence that it manufactures cluster bombs or components."West Yorkshire Police said inquiries were ongoing.A Barclays branch in Manchester was also targeted in a similar incident claimed by Palestine Action.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
