A town is looking for 10 new families to host Ukrainian refugees.Crediton, in Devon, is already home to about 40 refugee families, including several from Ukraine.Jennie Ford is the organiser of a conversation caf√© in the town, which allows residents and refugees to catch-up and connect. Ms Ford and the Ukrainian refugee living at her home have created a leaflet, which has been distributed to thousands of households, in a bid to attract more hosts. 
Ms Ford said hosting was "much more straightforward than it was 18 months ago when we started this journey".She said: "We want to remind people that people [from Ukraine] are still wanting to come and we hope our leaflet will help with that." 
Michael Chevalier, a Crediton resident, said: "I got the leaflet through the door last Monday and within a week I'd found someone."I thought, I've got a room to spare and look at the state of the world, this is something I can do literally on my doorstep."
Nadiia and her mother left their hometown of Mariupol, Ukraine, at the beginning of April.She said: "Our home is destroyed. Our city is destroyed. Our city is dead."We came here [Crediton] to start a new life ... so we will build it here."Devon County Council has a dedicated webpage to help support hosts and refugees.
