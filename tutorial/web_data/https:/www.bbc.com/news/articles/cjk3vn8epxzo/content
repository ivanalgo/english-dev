A widower has raised thousands of pounds for a hospice after carrying out his wife's final request.Les Reid, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, held a number of fundraising events following the death of his wife, Marian, in June 2022.Among those events was a garden party, which Marian wanted to be put on, and in total his efforts led to almost £6,000 being raised for Newark-based Beaumond House Hospice Care, which cared for Marian.The 78-year-old's fundraising efforts were recognised as he won the "Best Fundraiser" category at the Palliative and End of Life Care Awards last month in London.
After being diagnosed with cancer in 2018, his wife was given four to eight months to live.She was cared for at home by the hospice's team during the final months of her life.Mr Reid said the service allowed his wife of 18 years to be looked after in "familiar surroundings" and added the team "cared for her with so much dignity".His first fundraiser took place just two months after her death.“Marian knew the end was imminent and she didn’t want anyone to be sad," Mr Reid said."Her final instructions were to hold a garden party at home to raise funds for Beaumond House and to send her ashes skyward in a rocket - a purple rocket to be precise, as this was her favourite colour."The first fundraiser, it might've been my way of coping, because if I don't keep busy, I get morbid."
The garden party raised just under £2,000, funding two rise and recline chairs, the same kind which Mrs Reid used at home to make her more comfortable.Mr Reid added: "All this stuff. I knew they needed it, because it's stuff that I had to buy for Marian."It's personal in that way."He has since held two further events, one which saw him shave off his beard, while another saw two of his friends shave their heads.Andrea Ward, individual giving manager at Beaumond House, who nominated Les for the award, said: “Les has shown dedication and commitment to raising money and awareness of the hospice."His first fundraising event was just a few weeks after Marian’s death, but he was determined to make it happen and did a fantastic job."Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
