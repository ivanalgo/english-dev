Eight teams from the West Midlands have taken part in a football tournament for care leavers at Wolves' stadium.Ninety young people with care experience featured at Molineux, as the event was held at a Premier League ground for the first time.The club's official charity, the Wolves Foundation, hosted the six-a-side finals of the Care Leavers Championship Cup, along with City of Wolverhampton Council.Warwickshire Legends triumphed, and sides from Solihull, Shrewsbury, Coventry, Walsall, Staffordshire, Hereford and Wolverhampton also participated.
Players from all eight teams were given attendance medals and the winners' trophy was presented by the city's mayor, councillor Linda Leach.The council's side, The Wolverhampton Warriors, used the home team dressing room to prepare for matches and made it to the final.One of their players said the event last month was "able to make my dreams come true playing at a Premier League stadium", stating it was "an amazing memory that will never leave me". 
The tournament has grown following the first one two years ago, which involved four teams on a hired leisure centre pitch booked for two hours.The city council said the event could have been even bigger, with interest from "Leicester and Milton Keynes wishing to be involved".
