Crufts enters its last day with more than 24,000 dogs taking part in the show.Handlers were seen grooming the furry competitors and final preparation were being made for the show ring. The canines are judged according to their agility, behaviour and looks.The event is held at the National Exhibition Centre in Solihull, which is about half way between Birmingham and Coventry.

As the show kicked off, some dogs looked spectacular in colourful coats, scarves and leg warmers.A selection of agility and jumping tasks were on the agenda along with obedience challenges.This year's Crufts will come to an end following Best in Show and Presentation, organisers said.
