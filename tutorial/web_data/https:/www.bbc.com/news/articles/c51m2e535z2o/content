A builder who bought nine pints before fatally crashing into an 83-year-old driver  has been jailed for dangerous driving.Thomas De Lacy, from Luton, died in November 2021 - a week after his car was hit on the A507 near Maulden, Bedfordshire.Luton Crown Court heard Jason Briars, 54, had bought several pints of Guinness before his van struck Mr De Lacy's blue Corsa, travelling the other way.Briars admitted to the charge and was sentenced to five years in prison and will be subject to a two-year driving ban when released.
The crash took place at about 22:25 GMT on 6 November 2021.Prosecutor Robert Brown told the court that CCTV captured Briars going into Flitwick Social Club at 16:24 GMT earlier that evening.Briars went to hospital after the collision and a blood-alcohol sample was takenThe lowest “back calculation” of the amount of alcohol in his blood at the time of the crash was more than twice the legal limit, the prosecutor said.Mr De Lacy, of Trinity Road, died of his injuries on 13 November 2021.
Briars' barrister, Charles Langley, said his client was "very sorry". He added: "He pleaded guilty and indicated a guilty plea at the first opportunity."He told the court that Briars did not accept that he drank nine pints, but admitted he had drunk the vast majority of them.Mr Langley said Briars had been abusing alcohol, but since the crash had sought help, not drank and had counselling.Jailing him, Judge Michael Simon said Briars was before the court in “wholly avoidable circumstances that were tragic and criminally serious”.He told him: “You took the fateful decision to drive knowing you were not in a fit state to do so.“You must have been at least twice the legal limit for alcohol.“Your responsibility for the death of Mr Lacy will rest heavily on your shoulders. I accept your remorse is genuine and heartfelt.”The judge added: “It takes only one occasion when impaired by alcohol to kill. It is never worth taking the risk.“The consequences for the victim’s family and for the perpetrator and the perpetrator’s family are potentially catastrophic.”
