Plans for "much needed" new facility blocks at a Chobham Gypsy site are set to be agreed by councillors.Surrey County Council is proposing to replace the 15 utility blocks at the Kalima Gypsy, Roma, Traveller site in Chertsey Road.Cabinet members are set to agree the project at a meeting on Tuesday.The cost of the plans, which would provide purpose-built blocks with dedicated washing, cooking and toilet facilities, is not yet being made public.
Council documents show there is an "urgent need to provide safe and suitable utility blocks" for the 100 people on the site, which has been there for about 30 years.Subject to cabinet approving the project, a planning application would be submitted in September, and the council hopes works would be complete by January 2026.A spokesperson for Friends, Families and Travellers said the charity hoped to see similar action taken nationally.
They said: “We warmly welcome the news of Surrey Council’s redevelopment of Woking’s Kalima site."Home should be an environment that provides safety, security, and warmth. "We hope these works will lead to a much-needed improvement in the quality of life for Kalima site residents."Meeting documents show the current blocks have accessibility issues, and with "drainage and sewage treatment are not fit for purpose".Roads and pathways on the site would also be improved under the plans.
