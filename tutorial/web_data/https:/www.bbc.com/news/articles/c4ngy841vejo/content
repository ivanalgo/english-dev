A swimming pool which closed for 10 months for maintenance and energy-saving works has reopened.The scheme at Oakengates Leisure Centre, Telford, Shropshire, included installing an energy efficient roof covering, heat pump technology and a new ceiling and insulation in the pool area.The Â£2.2m investment began in September as part of what Telford and Wrekin Council said was its commitment to becoming carbon neutral by 2030."It has been fantastic seeing the pool open and in use again," said councillor Angela McClements.
The pool reopened on Monday in time for the summer holidays, the authority said.The work also saw improvements made to the site's gym, which reopened in February.
