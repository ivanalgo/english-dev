Ch Supt Kate Anderson described it as “a distressing case" for the affected family."We also realise how upsetting it will be for others who have lost loved ones to hear about this investigation," she said."And we are doing everything we can to build the broader picture of understanding around what has happened, and our officers continue to examine all the circumstances around this case."I know how many questions there will be around this case, and as soon as we have more information that we can share, we will do so.
