A man and his dog have escaped a flat fire that was started by a lit cigarette.Essex and County Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to the ground floor property in Glendale Close, Burnham, at 02:12 BST on Tuesday. It said a cigarette had been left next to an armchair, and due to the ashtray "overflowing", the chair caught fire, causing severe smoke damage. The occupant noticed the fire, got out safely, with his dog, called 999, and he was given oxygen, the service added. 
Jon Vincent, watch manager, said: "The occupant had put his cigarette in an ashtray next to his armchair when he got up to go to the kitchen."Unfortunately, because the ashtray was overflowing and the cigarette was not properly extinguished, it set the armchair alight."The fire was put out by 03:18 and crews remained at the scene until 04:20. Most of the damaged was contained to the lounge, but smoke spread throughout the property because internal doors were not closed, the service added.Mr Vincent said smokers should "make sure your cigarette is completely extinguished before you dispose of it and empty your ashtrays regularly to stop ash building up".
