A government minister has defended the growth of the logistics industry, saying it provided good jobs.Several warehouse developments in Northamptonshire have been opposed with some campaigners saying that type of employment was not needed in the area. But on a visit to Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal (DIRFT), transport minister Richard Holden said there were long-term careers in the industry."This isn't just about truck drivers and warehouses, this is about the entire supply chain," he said.
Warehousing projects in Towcester, Titchmarsh, Silverstone and Kettering have been opposed by local campaign groups.They said the developments were not appropriate for the area and that smaller hi-tech companies were needed in Northamptonshire.There has also been opposition to the new Northampton Gateway Rail Freight Interchange at junction 15 of the M1, including from Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom.
But Mr Holden said: "I want to ensure that, particularly here in Northamptonshire, jobs and benefits come to the whole of the local community."These are careers for the long term - you can see that with the huge investment in degree apprenticeships, which means people can earn while they learn."He was at DIRFT to launch the second phase of a programme to boost recruitment in the industry.Generation Logistics, which works with companies and industry bodies, has been backed by more than Â£600,000 of government funding.
The scheme also hopes to improve diversity in the workforce, with one of the three projects already running in Northamptonshire, at logistics company ProLogis, being specifically for students with special educational needs."We're building on outreach work, recruiting more young people and improving wages," Mr Holden said.The programme is part of the Future of Freight plan, which outlines how the government and industry can work more closely together on freight and logistics.
