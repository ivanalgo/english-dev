Three new Peregrine Falcon chicks have fledged at the University of Sheffield.The new arrivals were born on a nesting platform at St George's church, and bring the total number of chicks raised at the site since 2012 to 34.A spokesperson for the university said the nest had become "a vital centre for Peregrine Falcon recovery in the UK", with chicks fledged in the city spotted in County Durham and Cambridgeshire.Chris Greenwood, a member of the Sheffield Bird Study Group Committee, said the platform had proved to be a "soaring success".
As well as helping the with the birds recovery the platform has also created a buzz online, with a live webcam and blog dedicated to activity at the nest having attracted more than 4,000 visits this year.Mr Greenwood said: "I firmly believe that, for those in the know, the view from the webcam has become an iconic view of the Sheffield skyline. "We've even had students claim that their interaction with the webcam and blog have been partial inspiration for choosing Sheffield as a destination.“With continued monitoring and support, these majestic birds can continue their soaring success story, inspiring future generations and enriching the natural tapestry of our cities."
The Peregrine population in the UK hit a low point in the 1960s due to human persecution and the impact of pesticides in the food chain, according to the RSPB.However, improved legislation and protection has helped the birds to recover and they have now expanded into many urban areas.Of the 34 chicks fledged at the University of Sheffield site, one of the 2014 clutch has since found a new home at Wakefield Cathedral, where it has fathered 32 chicks since 2015.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
