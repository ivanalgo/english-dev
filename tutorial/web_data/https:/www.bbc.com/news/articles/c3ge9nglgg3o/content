A 14-year-old girl who stabbed a teenager in a row over a boy has been detained for two years and eight months.Swansea Crown Court heard she stabbed the girl five times on 16 November 2023, after threatening her on Snapchat.She was arrested the following day after the attack in Coelbren, Powys.At a previous hearing she admitted wounding with intent and being in possession of a bladed article.Neither of the girls can be identified due to their ages.
The court heard the teen sent threatening messages on social media because she thought the person she considered to be her boyfriend at the time was in a relationship with the girl.Carina Hughes, prosecuting, described how the messages were "volatile and threatening" and "indictive of jealousy".She said the teenager then went to a property and stabbed the girl five times, leaving her shirt "saturated" with blood. The court also heard that a comment was made referring to the possibility of the girl being pregnant, and how following the attack, "she won’t be now".The injured girl spent four days in hospital, and the attacker, who was on bail at the time of the incident, was arrested.
John Hipkin, defending, said the defendant pleaded guilty immediately after a psychiatric report showed she was fit to plead.He added it had been noted there had been a "significant change in maturity and attitude" in the time she had spent at a secure accommodation.Judge Paul Thomas said it was "a matter of luck that she wasn’t more badly hurt… or indeed luck that she was not killed".Speaking to the defendant, he added: "Because you thought that the person you considered to be your boyfriend had found another girlfriend, you first of all threatened her on Snapchat to stab her."And then… you did just that. You stabbed her several times."He said the words she used were "simply horrible". "I know you’re still only 14, but what you’ve done is so bad."The court heard she may be released after serving half the sentence if progress was made, and the judge also ordered a five-year restraining order.
