A hip-hop artist from Strabane, County Tyrone, is to spend the next year studying in Kentucky as part of the Study USA scholarship programme.Keegan Houston said he could not wait to get to the city of Louisville, home of one his favourite rap artists Jack Harlow.The 20-year-old has recently completed the higher national certificate in music at the North West Regional College in Londonderry – a far cry from Bellarmine University, which will become his home for the next year.Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle's Mark Patterson Show, Keegan said he was incredibly excited to be jetting off and taking the next step in his musical passion. 
The aspiring artist is one of just 52 students from Northern Ireland who will be jetting off to the United States.Keegan admitted it is a bit daunting going to the USA on his own for a year, especially since he has never travelled outside of Europe before, but knows great opportunities await him.He has been making music since he was about 13 and now performs as a solo artist and s part of the duo Anarchy, with friend Ciaran McLaughlin.His music has been featured on BBC Radio One and as part of BBC Introducing.
Keegan said he also has a background in break-dance, but eventually decided to start writing his own music, creating his own beats and performing his own songs. "Once I finished fifth year in Holy Cross College [Strabane], I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do, but I knew I wanted to follow music," he said. "I then moved on to the regional college and had my best two years I've ever had in education."I met so many friends, had great teachers and you really figure out who you are as a person there."Keegan said without the help of lecturer in Music and Performing Arts, Tony Talbot, they would not have got the opportunity to appear on BBC and develop their sound. 
The Study USA programme began in 1994 and is managed by the British Council, the UK’s international organisation for educational opportunities and cultural relations, on behalf of the Department for the Economy (DfE).Keegan said he has been inspired by a number of US rappers and hopes to one day become a recording artist and help put Strabane on the hip-hop world map.
