Four benches have been removed by police in Trowbridge after dozens of anti-social incidents were reported in just three months. Wiltshire Police said they had received 51 reports, including disorder, fighting and drug and alcohol consumption in the Wicker Hill area since April. This compares to just six over the same period in 2023. Neighbourhood policing team sergeant Charly Chilton said the action was "not a permanent solution", adding that officers were also focusing their attention on the people they believed are responsible.
Police were joined by Trowbridge Town Council, neighbourhood services and the Chamber of Commerce to patrol the area and remove the benches on Friday. Wiltshire Police said the area would be closely monitored by the town's neighbourhood policing team, with local businesses and residents encouraged to participate in upcoming community events to report anti-social behaviour.Sgt Chilton added that the force was looking for a long-term solution on antisocial behaviour in the area, such as a "revamped" Public Space Protection Order. 
Inspector Andy Lemon, from the neighbourhood policing team, said: "The displacement of the issue is unfortunately commonplace when it concerns anti-social behaviour, but we will continue to work alongside our partners and communities to make sure Trowbridge is a safe place to live, work and socialise."
