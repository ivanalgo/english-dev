Five new defibrillators have been installed in police stations across a county.The medical devices have been introduced to West Mercia bases in Kidderminster, Worcester, Malvern, Upton, and Evesham.The latest additions will join 860 defibrillators already installed in Worcestershire.Councillor Simon Geraghty said the project came about after an incident where there was confusion around where a defibrillator could be found
Councillor Geraghty said: "I am delighted that we have been able to step in and take action to make sure residents have access to this vital lifesaving equipment in locations where people go to get help."This project came about because of a real incident in Britannia Square in Worcester [around the corner from Worcester Police Station] where a resident potentially needed a defib and there was confusion around where they could find one."The fully automated defibrillators do not require any training to use and will talk a user through the process when activated. The equipment is attached to a patientâ€™s chest and gives an electric shock to the heart to restart a normal beat.
