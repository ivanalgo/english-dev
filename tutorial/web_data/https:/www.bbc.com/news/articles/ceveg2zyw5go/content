A DJ's debut record has reached number two in a music chart after he signed with his first label.Nath Brown, from Ryhope, Sunderland, saw his single released last week by Italian record label DPE.His EP, which contains the tracks I Get Deep and The Great Escape, proved a hit and flew up DJ site Beatport's electronic music chart.Brown said hearing his music played by famous DJs was "surreal" and he hoped his success would see him play more music overseas.
The 26-year-old musician said he made the track more than a year ago, but it was only played for the first time in August.Then Italian DJ Marco Carola played I Get Deep to 10,000 people on New Year's Eve.
"I was just about to go to sleep and a couple of mates sent me a video of the DJ playing it," Brown said."I couldn't get to sleep. You know when a DJ like that plays your music, you know you're about to go up in your career."
Carola then played his music again in Madrid, and its popularity led DPE to ask Brown to send them some demos.After signing to the label, his EP soared up the rankings on electronic music store Beatport.His success has led to him being asked to play with Pete Tong's orchestra, and has landed him a set at Forbidden Forest festival in Nottingham later this year.Brown said he was now in talks with other labels for his next track.The former Sunderland University student said the decision to quit his job at Foot Asylum two years ago was the right one."I knew my music was in a good place, but I wanted to be playing around the country and in Europe," he said."DPE is a big Italian label so hopefully that will lead to some overseas gigs."
