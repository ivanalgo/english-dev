Playground revamps in part of Surrey will see outdated equipment replaced with new swings and zip lines and other improvements including resurfacing.Mole Valley council said work had already taken place on Dorking’s Meadowbank Park site, and work would take place on six more playgrounds over coming months.Councillor Nick Wright, cabinet member for leisure and tourism, said the work demonstrated a commitment to investing in equipment, "helping to enable young people in the district to live healthy and active lives".Work is planned at recreation grounds in Ashtead, Bookham, Brockham, Holmwood and two sites in Leatherhead – the Kingston Road recreation ground and Redhouse Grounds playground.
Meadowbank Park’s playground, where work started at the beginning of July, now has a refurbished sandpit and fort, along with new planting.
