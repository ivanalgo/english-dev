Longer waiting times for cancer treatment in Wales is a "crisis", a charity has warned.NHS waiting lists have grown to their second highest levels and cancer waiting times are the second worst, according to latest statistics published by Welsh government.It said it was investing heavily in cancer services.Richard Pugh, head of partnerships for Macmillan Cancer Support, said he was no longer "shocked" by cancer waiting times.
"This is a trend that has happened over years and years. We have gotten into the stage where we call it a crisis," he told BBC Politics Wales."Sadly, I’m not shocked."According to Wales' health secretary, Eluned Morgan, some progress has been made on reducing the longest waits for treatment, with 97% of patients waiting less than two years in six out of seven Welsh health board areas.But Mr Pugh said patients were waiting longer than they should and that had a huge impact on them and their families. 
"We are now seeing people who have had their diagnosis and are waiting for the treatment to start. "These people have to think about their financial wellbeing because they have to take time off work."The psychological wellbeing and the impact on their families by waiting is just a growing anxiety," he said.In February, 53.4% of patients started treatment within 62 days of suspected cancer compared with 54.7% the previous month - the second lowest percentage ever recorded.
The cancer charity is providing support to patients, with demand huge at the moment.Mr Pugh said: "'Why are we waiting?' is a good question for the Welsh government because that is what patients are asking us."We need to make sure that we provide the answers for patients."The Welsh government said it was "investing heavily in cancer services to improve diagnosis and access to high-quality care"."And we have also launched a national programme to support recovery in cancer waiting times with £2m per year for three years."Access to cancer treatment is a priority and clinical teams and managers across the NHS in Wales are working hard to improve cancer performance."Mr Pugh said he had faith in the new first minister, Vaughan Gething, and wanted to see a greater collaboration between the health boards."I think that we can make improvement but we have got to be honest about where that is as well."He added: "We can't think that the existing workforce can deliver on its own. "It needs government support and government planning to make sure it's delivered quickly."Vaughan Gething is very dedicated towards cancer and he knows the problems."
