A naked knitted figurine depicting Coldplay singer Chris Martin has been taken to Glastonbury Festival in a hope it will meet the namesake performer.Avid crafter Sandra Witcombe made the doll "as a bit of fun", after five of her nude knits became a hit in the window display of The Hive Café in Shepton Mallet, Somerset. The doll is now in the fields of the festival, which opened on Wednesday morning. Ms Witcombe said she hoped "little Chris Martin" will bring a smile to the singer's face. Coldplay will be performing on the Pyramid Stage from 21:45 BST on Saturday.
Along with a group of others, Ms Witcombe knitted the original Shepton Mallet figures now known locally as The Hive Five.  The new Chris Martin doll which took Ms Witcombe 10 hours to make, is manoeuvrable and complete with a necklace, earrings and a bracelet. Through mutual friends, it has found a way to festival organiser, Emily Eavis. “It was boxed up with a letter to Chris, explaining that we’ve done it as a bit of fun," said Ms Witcombe.“We did ask, if he felt he could, to take a photograph with it so we could use it to help raise money for our cause."The Hive Café has been raising money with the dolls for the Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance and have so far raised around £5,000 for the charity.
But Ms Witcombe added this doll was not intended as a fundraising strategy, and was just meant to spread joy at the summer festival. "This is a gift to Chris, it’s his," she said.“We would love to see it on the stage, but whether that will happen, I don’t know.“He might just take one look at it and think ‘oh my God, who are these women?’ "But we hope that he takes it in the manner that it was meant in." Ms Witcombe now waits with "baited breath" to see if the band will have a surprise knitted guest on stage.
