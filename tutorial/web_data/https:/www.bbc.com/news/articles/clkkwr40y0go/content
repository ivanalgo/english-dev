An independent bar has accused a local authority of being greedy after it lost a tender process to keep operating in a council-owned venue.Cucina Sky Lounge opened in Barnsley's Market Kitchen in October 2019 and became a popular drinks venue in the new market hall.Owner Alessandro Vergine said they were now being "kicked out for no fault of our own" after a new operator was selected in a "bidding war" after their lease expired.Barnsley Council said it operated a "fair and transparent tender process where all businesses, including Cucina", could apply.
Mr Vergine said they submitted a business plan and an improved rent offer but "got told we were unsuccessful because the new tenant offered more rent"."I didn't realise it was a bidding war," he said.The father-of-one started the business with his wife Lucy, selling another venue to fully commit to Cucina.Their lease came to an end in September 2023 and operated on a tenancy-at-will agreement before the council put the venue out for tender.However, he said it was "a kick in the teeth" when he found out chain True North Brew Co, which operates 10 sites in Sheffield and Barnsley, had won the tender process."Barnsley Council had offered our business out to any interested parties and eventually gave it to the highest bidder with no regard to a local independent family who built the site up from scratch and managed to operate it and survive the hardest times in hospitality through Covid and cost of living crises," he said.In a post on social media, Mr Vergine garnered more than 400 comments from supporters of the business, with some saying they would boycott the new operator.
Offering an increased rent of 15% of their turnover, Mr Vergine said True North Brew Co had offered more, which he believes worked out to about £20,000 a year."All of this chaos, ultimately destroying a family's finances, was done over £20,000 over a year. It's mind-boggling," he said.The council said the bar in Market Kitchen was a "key part" of The Glass Works, a landmark leisure and shopping destination in the town centre.“The tender process included a range of assessment criteria including the quality of the customer experience, pricing strategy and offering value for money to customers, and how they would work together with other vendors in Market Kitchen, the Market and The Glass Works," a council spokesperson said.A number of applicants from local and regional businesses had applied during the process, which they maintained was "fair and transparent", they added.Mr Vergine praised his staff for their work since 2019."One of my staff was crying and said 'I can't believe Cucina has gone', and I said 'it hasn't, because half of it is equipment, the intangible part of Cucina which has never gone and will never go, is you guys'. They are Cucina," he added.The bar, which is currently closed, is due reopen "as soon as possible" under True North Brew Co, the council added.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
