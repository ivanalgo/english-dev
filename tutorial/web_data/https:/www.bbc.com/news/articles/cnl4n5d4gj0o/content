A birth centre remains closed due to staff shortages.Cossham Birth Centre, based at Cossham Hospital on the outskirts of Bristol, was shut in October 2022. In July 2023, hospital leaders said the midwife-led unit, in Lodge Road, would reopen in spring 2024 - but ongoing staffing issues have delayed this date.North Bristol NHS Trust, which runs the unit, has apologised for any disappointment caused by the centre's closure. 
The trust's chief nursing officer Prof Steve Hams said "providing safe care" was the trust's priority. "While we have made progress in recruitment, maternity workforce challenges remain across the NHS and regretfully we are not yet in a position to reopen the Cossham Birth Centre for births," he said.  "Work remains ongoing and we will update further as soon as possible. We are sorry for any disappointment this may cause," he added.Mendip Birth Centre remains open at Southmead Hospital, which offers an alternative midwife-led option. Community appointments, breastfeeding support and postnatal services are still being provided at Cossham Hospital.Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.
