A "manipulative predator" who raped children and women over decades has been jailed for 24 years. Peter Barnes, 57, was convicted of 43 sexual offences, including four counts of rape against two women and five children, aged from nine to 15, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. He had previously admitted one count of indecent assault.The earliest abuse dated back to the 1990s with the most recent taking place in 2023. Barnes, from Accrington, was also given an extended six-year licence period at Preston Crown Court. 
In October 2022, a woman reported to police that Barnes had sexually abused her as a child, the CPS said.During the investigation, more women came forward to reveal they were also abused by him.  Barnes, who initially denied all of the offences before pleading guilty to one charge before the trial began, was not in the dock to hear his sentence. He refused to attend in person or via videolink. Senior Crown Prosecutor Alex Mann said Barnes was a "manipulative predator" who targeted and groomed children as young as nine and showed "no remorse".His victims had been forced to reliver their ordeal, he said, "which further compounded the severe trauma his actions had caused".“I can only hope that now Barnes has been jailed the women will be able to move forward with their lives," he added. Det Con Hazel Richardson from Lancashire Police said his offending was "reprehensible, and caused his victims so much trauma".“The victims showed great bravery in coming forward," she said. Barnes was given a lifetime sexual harm prevention order and put on the sex offenders' register for life.
