A man has been sentenced for sexually assaulting a sleeping young woman at a holiday park. Raymond Hanks, 24, and the victim worked together at the park on the North Yorkshire coast.Following a trial at York Crown Court in June, he was found guilty of three counts of sexual touching on a female aged over 16.On Thursday, Hanks was handed a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.
North Yorkshire Police specialist staff investigator Insp Doug Stanway said there were "no winners" in the case as a number of young lives had been affected."The victim was drawn to work at the holiday park at the very beginning of her adult life and was seeking a better future for herself on the east coast," he said."This dream was shattered some six weeks later when she was violated by Raymond Hanks. She subsequently left her job and returned home."Insp Stanway added that he hoped the victim could "start to rebuild her life".Hanks, from Bridlington, was also made subject to a 10-year restraining order against the victim and placed on the Register of Sex Offenders for 10 years.He was acquitted of two further charges of attempted rape and rape.One charge was against the same woman and the other was against another woman who reported being raped by him while asleep in staff accommodation.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
