A lion has predicted a draw in England's opening football match of Euro 2024 against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, on Sunday.Rana and Kanha, two lions at Cotswold Wildlife Park near Burford, Oxfordshire, were tasked to bring their predictions ahead of England's Euro 2024 campaign in Germany on Sunday.Rana, who is a male, carefully considered the pictures of the two countries' flags before leaping at the window of his enclosure and putting a paw on each of them.He joins a long line of animals from around the world that have had a go at predicting World Cup results.
Park's carnivore keeper James Welch, who looks after the felines said Rana's decision had been "pretty conclusive".He had to wake the lions up a bit earlier than usual so that a BBC Radio Oxford reporter could pick their brains on the fortunes of the Three Lions before opening hours.
Rana took his time to understand the task but was on his way once the keeper pulled out a bag.Lioness Kahna, however, did not attempt to have a guess and instead watched her mate at work from bed.Depending on the game's outcome, Rana could become a successor of Paul the Octopus, who shot to global fame by correctly 'predicting' the winners of 11 out of 13 matches during Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup.
