Further strike action by Morrisons staff has been suspended after an improved pay offer from the supermarket, a union said.About 1,000 members of staff in West Yorkshire and Cheshire walked out from 23 to 26 May in the row over pensions and take-home pay. Another walk-out was set to take place at warehouses in Wakefield and Northwich between 13 and 16 June, but Unite called it off as a "goodwill gesture".A Morrisons spokesperson said the firm was pleased it had found a "way forward subject to the result of the ballot".
The union said workers were being forced to increase their own pension contributions while Morrisons reduces theirs by the same amount.This left workers £500 a year worse off, with pay and conditions issues also in dispute, Unite said. The Bradford-headquartered retailer previously said it had offered workers a 9% pay increase.Adrian Jones, Unite national officer, said: "As a goodwill gesture, and following a new offer from Morrisons, we are suspending any planned strike action while we ballot our members."A spokesperson for the supermarket chain said: "We are pleased that through open communication with Unite we have together found a way forward - subject to the result of the ballot."Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
