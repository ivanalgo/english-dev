A charity which organises trips and meals for youngsters in the school holidays says it is struggling to keep up with demand for their services.Bristol's Community of Purpose is now calling on local businesses to assist it to help every child that needs their support.It comes after a recent survey suggests that around a quarter of parents in the South West responded to say they would struggle to provide three meals a day this summer.Three in ten parents told Action for Children that they worried their children would experience an "unhealthy holiday".
Community of Purpose was founded by a brother and sister duo back in 2016. One of the founders, Amy Kington says despite falling inflation many families were finding things difficult."What we found, particularly in south Bristol more recently, is that demand is outstripping what we can physically supply," she said."So every day we run our holiday camp, there are young people that will turn up to access this provision hoping that somebody doesn't turn up so that they can occupy their seat on the coach."
During the summer holidays she helps to take young people on trips to city centre attractions and even arranges for meals in hotels to ensure they are properly fed."The challenge that we face as community-minded activists is when we drive off, having not been able to take a young person on that coach, there's that knotted feeling in our tummies about what they're likely to experience that day," she said."So is that the day when you know they're in the wrong place at the wrong time or they get involved in things that you know really take them down a path that that you wouldn't want them to to to pursue?"If you're already accessing that food bank, then to find the money for additional food times by, however many days times by, however many children, it can put those that are finding things very difficult under enormous pressure."
UK Children's charity Action for Children recently spoke to 2,000 parents about the summer holidays.Their responses showed 30% of parents in the region believe they will be financially worse off this summer compared to last year.Balancing work and family life was a huge concern among the South West parents polled, with more than half (56%) concerned they wonâ€™t be able to spend as much time together as a family due to work commitments.More than a fifth (21%) reported planning to take time off work as unpaid leave or take time off sick to provide childcare.Their head of campaigns and public affairs, Alice Woudhuysen, said the findings came as something of a surprise."We've witnessed falling inflation and sort of signs of economic growth but our frontline staff do tell us they see this every day," she said."So they see the financial and emotional strain the summer holidays can have on families, and particularly those on low incomes"Typically during the holidays parents have more mouths to feed, they have more clothes to wash and they don't get that essential support like free school meals that they get during term time."And also leisure activities tend to rise during the holidays, and parents have to juggle work and childcare."
