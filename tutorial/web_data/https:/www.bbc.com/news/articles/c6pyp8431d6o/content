A participant in a wrestling event involving people with learning disabilities has said stepping into the ring with a pro wrestler for the first time was a pinch-yourself moment.The Foyle Rumble saw members of the Tuned In Project take on professionals for a showpiece at a Londonderry hotel.Taylor Healy said he had always dreamt of becoming a wrestler."I remember growing up as a kid I was always watching wrestling and I used to think about what it was like to be like them in the ring," Taylor said.
"I didn't know I was going to get this chance now and I was so excited about it."Taylor said he learned a lot from the experience and was really proud of how far he has come on his wrestling journey in such a short time.The Tuned In Project offers creative and personal development opportunities for people in the north west with learning disabiliies.Sean Curran from the organisation said members had trained hard for more than five months for the event.
He said the Foyle Rumble was by far the biggest event it had staged so far."You've got adults with learning disabilities who are the main stars in the ring with the professional wrestlers," he explained."Different matches would see them fighting with and also against the wrestlers."
Mr Curran said the event had been a huge success and their members had taken a lot from the experience."I've seen their sporting ability gro, but the big thing for me is seeing their confidence grow as well because many of them would not really be used to performing in front of a big crowd," he said."They've literally grown so much in confidence with every week that's past."
Noel Mulgrew, who took part in the Foyle Rumble, said it was an unbelievable experience."This is something that I've never done before in my entire life," he said."I think these past few months have been an unforgettable experience and I've really had a good time."
PJ Morrison told BBC News NI that he loved every minute of his wrestling debut."It's been brilliant and taking part in this event has been something that we'll all never forget," he said."Our hard work at training has paid off and I've enjoyed it very much. It's fun to be able to catch up with your friends and learn new skills."
The success of the Foyle Rumble captured the attention of a local filmmaker.Rachael McNamee is now making a documentary about the success of the wrestling extravaganza and the benefit the experience had on Tuned In Project members.
