An award-winning hotel and wedding venue looks set to be converted into housing. Stower Grange Hotel in Drayton could be turned into three homes under plans submitted to Broadland District Council (BDC).The Grade II listed structure was previously put on the market with an asking price of £1.35m.The application comes following the owner’s concerns that the business, which is also a restaurant, may be “unsustainable”.
The Grange was first built in the 1600s and was previously used as a rectory.The 11-bedroom hotel sits four miles from the centre of Norwich and has two acres of grounds, with rear landscaped gardens and woodlands.A planning statement submitted to BDC said: “Due to an uncertain and potentially unsustainable future as a hotel, further accelerated by the impact of the recent pandemic, the client and owner of Stower Grange Hotel has reluctantly explored the more viable use.“The proposal looks to maintain a design layout which remains loyal to the existing internal and external design to retain architectural features, original access routes and ensure the generous spaces continue to be provided within at all floor levels.”The developer said the change would result in minimal alteration while continuing the use as living accommodation while providing “a high quality and unique opportunity” that would “compliment the local community”.The application will be decided by BDC in due course.
