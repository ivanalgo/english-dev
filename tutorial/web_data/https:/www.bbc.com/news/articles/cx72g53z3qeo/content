Archaeologists have uncovered what they believe to be signs of prehistoric life in Faversham in Kent.The Kent Archaeological Society believes it has found a burial site dating back between 1,500 and 3,000 years at Lees Court Estate.The discoveries from the dig include flint chippings produced by tool making, fragments of pottery and evidence of cremations.The society is now looking for researchers to work on the history of the nearby Stringmans Farm in Badlesmere.
Lees Court was built in 1652 on the site of an earlier house, by Sir George Sondes whose family had bought the estate in 1600.Richard Taylor, general manager at Kent Archaeological Society, said: “Our work at Stringmans Field represents a major contribution to prehistoric research in Kent, providing a fascinating insight into life over 5,000 years ago."Kent is England’s oldest county and is home to more castles and historic houses than any other region but the information we’ve gleaned to date precedes any castle or house."
