A patient support organisation in Surrey has been awarded nearly £240,000 to help women experiencing cancer-induced menopause.Menopause and Cancer was awarded £238,572 in National Lottery funding over three years to support its work.The not-for-profit community interest company was set up in 2022 by Dani Binnington, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in her early 30s and later had a surgical menopause.Funding will go towards costs for the provision of expert-led workshops, in-depth programmes, community events, retreats and volunteer training.
Menopause and Cancer has said one-in-two women get a cancer diagnosis at some point in their lives.For 90% of women over the age of 40 and 40% of those under 40, cancer treatment will push them into menopause.The organisation, which is based in Thames Ditton, said many women experience debilitating mental and physical symptoms as a result and also say they have no help in managing this.Ms Binnington said: “Each week I speak to women who say that navigating menopause as a result of their cancer treatment is harder than chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery altogether."There are millions without support and I am excited to be a part of making this a more positive experience for many.”
