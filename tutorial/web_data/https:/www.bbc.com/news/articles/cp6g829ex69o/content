Organisers of the Royal National Mòd say they have received a "diverse range" of views and opinions on its proposals to make some of the biggest changes in the festival's 130-year history.Under An Comunn Gàidhealach's plans, the popular choir competitions would include two main contests - one for large choirs and the other for smaller ones.Rules around some categories could be relaxed to open them up to other genres of music - including barbershop and musicals.However, the songs would be translated into Gaelic.
An Comunn Gàidhealach has been consulting choirs on the proposals.A spokeswoman said: "The responses have provided a diverse range of views and opinions which will be extremely helpful in the next stages of the consultation."The board of An Comunn Gàidhealach will now analyse the information, views and key themes that appear in the responses."Following this, correspondence on possible recommendations and implementation will follow in due course."
This year's celebration takes place on 11-19 October in Oban - dubbed the home of the Mòd.It will be the 17th time the festival has been held in the Argyll town.Online entries for the competitions, which also include Highland dancing and drama, close at midnight on 31 May.Marina MacKay, of An Comunn Gàidhealach, said: "Last year’s Mòd in Paisley welcomed over 8,000 visitors, including over 2,000 participants, to over 200 events and we expect this year’s festival to bring together even more people to celebrate Gaelic music and culture."
