A Royal Navy officer has completed a "bizarre" and "beautiful" charity run from Land's End to John O'Groats.Lt Cdr Alex Miles, who is stationed at Portsmouth Naval Base in Hampshire, completed the challenge on Friday afternoon.The 37-day run, which he began on 1 June, saw the officer cover more than 1,000 miles (1609km) on foot.He raised £2,500 for the Royal Navy & Royal Marines Charity (RNRMC) and Alabaré, a homelessness charity assisting veterans.
The 43-year-old, who was born and raised in Newport, south Wales, joined the Royal Navy as an Able Rate submariner in 1999.Running between eight and 10 hours a day, he said the hardest part was his "emotional" mental state."It was just eat, sleep, run, repeat, day after day," he said. "It was bizarre."The bespoke route, from western Cornwall to northern Scotland, took in some of the UK's most beautiful trails.His favourite was the Lake District, which he described as being "beautiful" and "one of the best days ever".On Wednesday, he ran through the Scottish village of Kinbrace in Sutherland, which included a "six-mile section of ankle-deep bog, mud and poo"."But I seemed to thrive in it!" he laughed.
When asked why he chose to donate the money to RNRMC and Alabaré, he said: "Because they give veterans another chance at life.""That's been the drive. Alabaré helps them off the street, gives them a bed to sleep on."And the Royal Navy & Royal Marines Charity makes life normal for naval families," said Lt Cdr Miles, who is married to a serving naval officer with whom he shares two young children.
