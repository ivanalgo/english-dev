McDonalds has submitted plans to build a drive-thru and restaurant on the site of a popular bingo hall. The fast food chain wants to demolish Buzz Bingo on Oslo Road in Hull to make way for its new branch.If approved, application agents Lichfields said the restaurant would create the equivalent of 70 full-time jobs, as well as 100 construction jobs, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.A spokesperson for Buzz Bingo confirmed the current venue would close when the lease ran out in 2025 but it was looking at alternative locations. 
Users of the bingo hall previously told the BBC they would be losing important social connections.Gail Crombie, 80, told BBC Look North in April that "the elderly, like me, are going to be stuck in the house" if the bingo hall closed.She added: "I'm going to be stuck in this room with the telly and a book and it's no good. You need to keep your old grey matter working."A petition was also set up by resident James Danby, who said he was concerned the move "threatens to displace an important community hub". Buzz Bingo said it understood "the impact [the closure] may have on our loyal and valued customers" and was "exploring alternative locations and premises within the local area".
McDonald's has outlined the economic case for its plans at Sutton Fields and said it was "keen to invest in Hull".It said the restaurant would be a multi-million pound investment in the area that would prove £45,000 a year to Hull City Council in business rates, in addition to creating about 100 full and part-time jobs.
