A four-star hotel has been given the go-ahead to build a boathouse and accommodation on the shores of Windermere, by a government inspector.The Planning Inspectorate overturned a decision by the Lake District National Park Authority (LDNPA) to allow Storrs Hotel, in Bowness, to build on the shoreline.The LDNPA had said the project would "fail to reflect the traditional character" of local boathouses due to its design and size.The inspector said similar schemes had already been approved in the area and the boathouse would "not appear prominent".
In September, members of the LDNPA's development control committee turned down plans against their own officers' advice.Their decision notice added the proposals would "contribute towards the incremental spread of development along this undeveloped section of the Windermere lakeshore, within the open countryside."
However, a planning inspector allowed the appeal by Storrs Hotel and concluded the proposed development would "not conflict" with the development plan.Planning documents said the structure would feature a "vacation unit" with two bedrooms and a minimal, non-ramped channel leading to the wet dock area of the boathouse and new jetty, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.In documents submitted as part of the application, applicants for Storrs Hall said the work was part of a programme of investment at the site.They added: "The proposed interventions will enable a larger group of visitors to enjoy the vista of Storrs Hall, which contributes to the English Lake District World Heritage Sites Outstanding Universal Value."
