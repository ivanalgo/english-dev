All the refugees who arrived in a rural area of North Yorkshire as part of a government resettlement scheme have now left the area.High rents and a lack of "cultural ties" have been cited as reasons why they have moved out of Craven, which includes the market towns of Skipton and Settle.North Yorkshire Council said it preferred to place refugees in parts of the county where there were already communities from their country of origin or who spoke the same language.A group of Syrian families who were given accommodation in Skipton as part of the UK Resettlement Scheme have now relocated, and although Afghan nationals have remained in Craven, they had not arrived via the same programme.
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, a total of 175 people from war-torn countries such as Iraq and Sudan have been placed in North Yorkshire through the scheme since 2021, and Harrogate has become a "hub" for the Syrian community, who have built their own mosque.Ukrainian refugees, Hong Kong citizens or Afghans who worked for British forces are not included in the programme.North Yorkshire Council’s assistant chief executive for local engagement, Rachel Joyce, said the authority’s focus was on providing “the most appropriate accommodation” once refugees arrived rather than spreading people evenly across the county.
Angie Pedley from the Craven District of Sanctuary support organisation said: “The council prefers to settle people into hubs."They feel, and I can see the point, that people are happier if there are others around who speak the same language.“In Harrogate, they have events together and are in touch with one another.”Ms Pedley also pointed to high accommodation costs in Skipton and Settle and a shortage of social housing.Afghan families who have stayed in Craven include one who have launched pop-up restaurant evenings in the village of Embsay, serving cuisine from their home country.Ms Pedley said a number of Ukrainian families she had worked with have also moved to more affordable areas of Lancashire."There have been a fair number of Ukrainians welcomed to Craven, including to Settle and remote villages," she said."Once they found their feet, most who wanted to rent independently went across to East Lancashire where rents are cheaper, like in Colne, Burnley and Barnoldswick.”Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
