A woman has become an unlikely social media star in her Cornish village  - all thanks to a family of tawny owls.Diane Knight had set up a CCTV system so she could watch the owls nesting in her barn near Carnon Downs, Cornwall.But when the male owl stopped bringing the female food, Mrs Knight stepped in.Her work to supply the owl and the baby owlet with dead mice has proved popular on the village's Facebook page.
Mrs Knight's owl obsession started through watching the pair of tawny owls on a nest-cam she had set up.She said the male owl was injured in a fight with a rival owl and stopped bringing the female the food she needed while sitting on her single egg.Mrs Knight, 69, took advice and started buying dead mice, stocked as snake food by local pet shops, soon racking up a bill of more than Â£100.She was told to place the mice on a nearby beam to avoid disturbing the nest, which involved climbing up a 15ft (4.5m) ladder.She also started to share stills and video on the Carnon Downs And Surrounding Area Notice Board on Facebook and was inundated with offers of help from followers."They've been brilliant," she said. "One gentlemen paid for 30 and another lady she paid for 20 so I've got 50 dead mice waiting for me."We've got enough now, we've got a freezerful."
Her regular owl updates on Facebook are attracting dozens of likes and comments."I am a little bit addicted to it myself, I haven't watched television for months," she said."I cannot believe how one little owlet has brought the community together."I went to the dentist and the first thing they said to me is 'Are you the Owl Lady of Carnon Downs?'."Mrs Knight has named the owlet Dorothea - Dotty for short  - and is hoping the  young bird is soon learn to fly, leave the nest and hunt for its own mice dinners.
