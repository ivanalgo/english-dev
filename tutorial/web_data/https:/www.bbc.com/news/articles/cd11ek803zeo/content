Police officers did not contribute to the death of a woman when a vehicle they were pursuing hit her car, the police conduct body said.The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said its investigation of the police forces in Norfolk and Suffolk found "the actions of all officers involved in the pursuit were appropriate and in line with policy and guidance".Aisatou Mballow-Baldeh, 28, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, was killed in August when the Nissan Juke she was driving collided with a stolen Land Rover in Earsham, Norfolk. Two men were jailed over her death. The IOPC said it was now consulting with Norfolk Police over learning recommendations it has made to the force. 
The incident began with Suffolk Constabulary responding to reports of a stolen car following a burglary in Newmarket, about 50 miles (80km) away in west Suffolk. A Land Rover Defender was then pursued through a field with officers on the ground assisted by a police helicopter from the National Police Air Service (NPAS).The Land Rover was pursued by police cars and a police helicopter along the A143.During a trial in March, Norwich Crown Court heard how Marcin Jablonski tried to escape from police through a field, before driving back on to the A143 and hitting the other car, which was travelling in the opposite direction.He admitted causing death by dangerous driving and other offences.His son, Thomaz Urbaniak, a passenger in the stolen car, was jailed for two years after admitting aggravated vehicle taking and burglary of a commercial premises.
The IOPC said it investigated whether all police officers and staff involved in the pursuit acted in accordance with local and national policies, procedures, training and guidance.It also assessed the communication between police officers, control room staff and NPAS and the actions of police officers following the incident - specifically the aftercare provided."We found the actions of all officers who provided emergency medical attention at the scene were also in line with policy and guidance," the IOPC said. The police conduct body said there was no indication any police officer had behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings or had committed a criminal offence.
The IOPC said it was now consulting with Norfolk Police over the learning recommendations it had made.These included training or guidance to police drivers on the role of the NPAS during pursuits, specifically covering the level of commentary expected from police officers where NPAS are leading on radio communications.IOPC regional director Mel Palmer said: “Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Aisatou Mballow-Baldeh and all those affected by this tragic incident."A spokesperson for Norfolk Police said: "Our thoughts today, as they have been throughout, remain with Mrs Mballow-Baldeh’s husband, family and friends."The incident was referred to the IOPC which carried out an independent investigation into the response and actions of officers at the scene and has now concluded that all officers acted appropriately and in line with policy and guidance."We will continue to work with the IOPC to fully understand its learning recommendations."
