A man who sexually assaulted two passengers on Greater Manchester's Metrolink has been jailed and banned from the tram network indefinitely.Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said Tahir Ali, from Oldham, "brazenly" touched two women "intentionally" on services in Manchester city centre despite being challenged.The 37-year-old was convicted of two counts of sexual assault at Manchester Crown Court,  jailed for three years and given an order barring him from any Metrolink tram, platform or car park.Transport for Greater Manchester’s Kate Green said Ali used "busy services to try and mask his offending", but had "now been brought to justice".
A GMP representative said Ali's crimes were "uncovered following an investigation by our transport unit"."Ali intentionally touched the two females in a sexual manner on trams in the city centre despite being challenged," they said.They added that after the attacks were reported, Ali was "identified from CCTV images", before being "charged and remanded".Speaking after the hearing, PC Matthew Cowin said Ali's sentence showed the force's "commitment to keep passengers safe and in the knowledge they can use the transport network without any concerns around their safety"."This investigation and the bravery of the victims to report and recount their experiences have ensured we have been able to apply and be granted a sexual harm prevention order, which has strict restrictions in place to prevent re-offending due to the risk he poses because of his behaviour," he added.Ms Green said Ali "used busy services to try and mask his offending, which he did brazenly and while surrounded by dozens of people".“Thanks to the bravery of his victims in coming forward... he has now been brought to justice," she said.“I hope this sentence goes some way to reassuring customers, in particular women and girls, that we will do whatever we can to bring people like Ali to justice."
