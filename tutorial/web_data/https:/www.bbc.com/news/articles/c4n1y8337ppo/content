The family of a home care patient had to intervene when a carer tried to serve their relative yoghurt in a dog bowl, a report revealed.A drink was also prepared by the carer - from agency Access Dignity Care Ltd - by filling a mug from the tap and putting a tea bag in it.The home care provider, based in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, was rated inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in a report published earlier.It has been contacted for comment by the BBC.
The service was supporting 68 people across north Essex when it was inspected by the care watchdog after concerns were raised.They included patients living with dementia, mental health needs or a physical disability.
Hazel Roberts, of the CQC, said the care agency was not always "safe and compassionate".“Leaders weren’t always responding quickly when things went wrong," she said. "In one incident, staff provided poor first aid when someone was burnt and needed an ambulance, causing avoidable pain and discomfort."Ms Roberts added that staff were not knowledgeable about people's health conditions or preferences.The report also outlined how a patient reported having a bad cough and was "struggling to breathe", but it had not been followed up by their carers.However, most carers were praised by the families of patients for being "kind".The service, which was previously rated good by the watchdog, was downgraded to an inadequate score and placed in special measures.
