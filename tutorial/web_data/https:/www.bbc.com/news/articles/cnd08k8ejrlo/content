Two men have completed a 1,000-mile (1,600km) race on the water through the Canadian and Alaskan wilderness in aid of charity.Chris Davidson and Nick Hobley from Hampshire, took eight days to paddle the Yukon 1000, which organisers say is the world's longest canoe race.They faced the threat of bears, rapids, mosquitoes and exhaustion to cover 130 miles a day which equated to 18 hours of paddling.Mr Hobley posted on social media it felt "absolutely fantastic" to complete the course.
The pair, who live in Fleet and Farnborough, described it as an "amazing adventure".The race follows the route of the 19th Century Klondike goldrush from Whitehorse in Canada's Yukon Territory to Dalton Highway Bridge in Alaska.They took 50kg (110lbs) of food in the form of military ration packs that was used to replace 8,000 calories they burned paddling each day.The pair fancied taking on the bigger challenge after previously completing the 125-mile DW Canoe Race between Devizes in Wiltshire and Westminster.The daring duo have amassed almost Â£20,000 for The Royal Marine Charity and PSC Support which raises money for people affected by the liver condition primary sclerosing cholangitis.
