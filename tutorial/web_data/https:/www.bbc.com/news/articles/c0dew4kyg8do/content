The brother of a man wrongfully arrested after the murder of his daughter has called for an apology from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).Russell Bishop killed nine-year-olds Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway in a woodland den in Brighton in 1986.Sussex Police apologised on Wednesday for mistakes in its investigations, including the arrest of Nicola's father Barrie as part of a linked inquiry in 2009.Nigel Heffron, the brother of Barrie Fellows, said: “Thank you to Sussex Police for finally getting around to admitting their mistakes and apologising. But now it is time for the CPS to do the same.”
The CPS has said it is conducting a thorough review of the case.Mr Heffron said the “ripple effect” of the mistakes by Sussex Police were vast.“You don’t see how much damage it does,” he told BBC Radio Sussex. “It cost me my marriage, it cost Barrie and Susan their marriage."He added: “There were times I wanted to give up. But the only thing that kept me going was the truth.”A CPS spokesperson said: “We have received a complaint. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time.”
In 1986, Bishop was cleared of their murders, which became known as the "Babes in the Wood" case, but went on to kidnap another girl, leaving her for dead.In 2018, he was convicted of Nicola and Karen’s murders after double-jeopardy laws were changed, permitting a second trial.He died in prison in 2022.Following the case, the girls' families complained to Sussex Police, prompting a review to be commissioned by Jo Shiner, the then-deputy chief constable of the force.A review by Surrey Police pinpointed failings in the 1986 criminal investigation.It found Barrie Fellows should not have been arrested and there was, and remains, no evidence of any wrongdoing on his part.Sussex Police said Ms Shiner, who is now the chief constable, had separately met with both families to formally apologise.Details of the review have not been released at the request of the families, Sussex Police said.
