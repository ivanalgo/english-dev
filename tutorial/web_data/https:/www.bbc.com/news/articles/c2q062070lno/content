A decision on plans to upgrade a sewer network to protect against "foul water flooding" has been put on hold.United Utilities says construction of a pumping station would help to deliver a "more resilient" wastewater infrastructure to Burneside in Cumbria.Planning documents suggest the village's existing system is unable to cope during periods of heavy rainfall, causing floods.Planning officers had recommended the scheme for approval despite more than 50 objections, but Westmorland and Furness Council deferred its decision following a meeting at County Hall in Kendal.
The scheme would see United Utilities construct a below-ground pumping station and an above-ground kiosk on land near Carling Hill.
Plans also involve constructing an access road and a larger-diameter sewer to replace the existing pipeline.The proposed sewer would have a diameter of 300mm (12ins) whereas the current one has a diameter of 150mm (6ins), according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.The development would upgrade 820m (2,700ft) of the sewage network from Bridge Street to Steels Row and Burneside Road. The sewer would then connect with the proposed underground pumping station.Members of the council's South Lakeland local area planning committee voted to consider the application at a future meeting, once they have more information on other sites considered by United Utilities and on the "future-proofing" of the proposals.According to planning documents, objectors raised concerns that the site is outside the development boundary for Burneside and therefore constitutes "urban and industrial creep" into the countryside.However, in a report, planning officers said the proposals could be labelled "essential local community infrastructure" that cannot be reasonably located elsewhere.
