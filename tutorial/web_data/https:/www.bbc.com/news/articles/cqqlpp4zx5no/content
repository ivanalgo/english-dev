A street used by people leaving their vehicles to visit a nearby college and school is a “public car park Monday to Friday” fed-up residents have told councillors.People living on Castle Croft Drive and the surrounding area presented a 85-name petition to Sheffield City Council, calling for action to tackle the problem.At a meeting, one resident urged the local authority to “help us get our safety and quality of life back”.A senior councillor said they would investigate whether a parking scheme could be introduced.
Residents of the street in Norfolk Park told the council's transport, regeneration and climate policy committee that commuters, Sheffield College students and parents picking up from the nearby All Saints high school were blighting their lives.They said bad parking narrowed the road as well as pavement parkers hindering pedestrians, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.One resident told councillors: “It’s a public car park Monday to Friday. We’ve been raising this issue for eight years with councillors.” The resident said that they had been told to be patient as their problems would be dealt with by a parking scheme encompassing Park Hill and surrounding areas but that was eventually rejected by councillors last year.She urged councillors: “Give us our safety and quality of life back.”Committee chair councillor Ben Miskell said the petition showed local support for residents' requests.“We will investigate whether a limited parking scheme covering Castle Croft Drive could be delivered at no cost to the council, given the financial pressures,” he said.“We will work together to see what can be done,” added Mr Miskell.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
