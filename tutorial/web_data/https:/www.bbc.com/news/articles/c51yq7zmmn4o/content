Fans of television soap Coronation Street may soon be able to sink a pint at Blackpool’s own version of the fictional Rovers Return local after a town hall panel gave the go-ahead for its alcohol licence.Lyndsey Ann Whiteside has been granted a premises licence for 52 Coronation Street in the seaside town, and is set to name it after the the famous ITV show's pub.However, councillors ruled against the venue being allowed to serve until 02:00 BST on Fridays and Saturdays and said it must call time at midnight.The proposals had sparked objections from neighbours concerned about late night disruption.
The hearing was told the investment would bring an empty property back into use.There were no objections from the police or licensing authority, but four neighbours had lodged comments warning of potential increases in noise and anti-social behaviour.Ms Whiteside withdrew a request to provide live music and the licence was granted with conditions including alcohol can be served from 10:00 to midnight daily with the premises closing by 00:30.A council report setting out the decision said: "The panel accepted the applicant was experienced in operating premises in problematic areas and although the residents had concerns, the panel were satisfied in general terms that the licensing objectives would not be undermined if they approved this application."It added the main concern was the proposed 02:00 closing time at weekends in an area which does not have late-night bars.The decision notice said: "There is a hotel immediately next door and in the panel’s opinion, the noise of people standing outside smoking or leaving the premises would be acceptable until midnight given the location and the general noise in the area at that time."The early hours of the morning would be much quieter and therefore the noise from people standing outside smoking or leaving the premises would be more intrusive and would in the panel’s opinion undermine the licensing objectives.”Any appeal against the decision can be made within 21 days.
