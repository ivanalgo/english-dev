An airport has completed a Â£20m project to upgrade its security scanners.Luton Airport said passengers will no longer need to remove liquids and electronic items from their bags as they pass through security. All security lanes are equipped with "state-of-the-art body scanners and CT scanner technology" and "next generation security scanners".Although it means checks might now be faster, current Government restrictions mean bottles and containers are still limited to 100ml or less, it added.
Neil Thompson, chief operations officer, said: "We are delighted to become one of the first major airports to offer the benefits of next generation security to all passengers. "This investment provides London Luton Airport with enhanced screening technology that will significantly elevate the service provided to passengers flying from LLA this summer and beyond, aligning perfectly with the simple, friendly passenger experience we always look to deliver."The airport said it is expecting 220,000 passengers to pass through the airport this weekend with a total of 2.5m passengers to use the site over the school summer holiday period.
