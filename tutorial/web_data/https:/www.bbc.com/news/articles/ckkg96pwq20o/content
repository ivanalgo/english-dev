A man shot dead on a street on Merseyside has been named by police as Rikki Berry.The 36-year-old was shot on Quarryside Drive in Kirkby, Knowsley, on Wednesday at about 18:35 BST, in what police believe was a targeted attack.He was taken to hospital but pronounced dead a short time later.A 20 year-old man from Kirkby has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in police custody.
Merseyside Police said an investigation into the shooting, which took place near Liverpool FC's training ground, is still in its early stages."The arrest of this man is just one part of this process and the extent of his involvement will form part of our enquiries," Det Ch Insp Cath Cummings said."I want to emphasise that this investigation is in its very early stages and extensive work is underway to find anyone who may have been involved."It initially appears to have been a targeted shooting, carried out in broad daylight in view of witnesses, who will have understandably been left shocked and upset at what happened.“Therefore, it remains absolutely vital that we hear from anyone who saw this incident, or has since heard anything about what happened."
Anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed the incident or has video footage is asked to contact the force."However small a detail you may think you hold, let us make the assessment," Det Ch Insp Cummings added.Knowsley Local Policing Sup Int Karl Baldwin said: “The Kirkby community will see a lot of activity in the area today and I want to encourage people to speak to our officers."We understand that people are sometimes reluctant to speak to police, but be assured that we will deal with information sensitively and put necessary measures in place to support those who help, as well as providing highly visible policing in the area in the coming days."Merseyside Police said patrols in the area had been stepped up to provide reassurance to the community and a mobile police station will be been set up in the Northwood area in the next week.“Gun crime causes devastation, as last night’s tragic events sadly show," Sup Int Baldwin said."We will do all we can to bring those responsible to justice, and remove weapons from those communities who suffer from the great harm that organised crime brings.”
