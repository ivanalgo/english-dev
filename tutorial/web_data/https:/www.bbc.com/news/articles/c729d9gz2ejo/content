'A lack of investment' has been blamed for the reason Sark is still burning its waste in open pits.Frank Makepeace, former chair of the Douzaine, which is responsible for the island's infrastructure, said the incinerator had problems "for years".He said all non-recyclable waste used to be destroyed by incinerator, but since October 2023 it has been unable to generate enough heat to deal with everything."There has been talk of installing a new incinerator, which would operate at higher temperatures, but my belief is it has become a cost factor," Mr Makepeace said.
Mr Makepeace was forced off the Douzaine committee in April after he was left as the only member follow a string of resignations.He said a lack of political will to spend money had impacted the island's infrastructure."I don't think there is a shortage of people that could do the work and install a proper system for us."I think we have this problem in Sark where we seem to have this sense of entitlement that others should help us or subsidise us."But we all have to put our hands in pockets and pay for it if we want to maintain the image of the island."
Many of those in hospitality and tourism, generally, agree the situation is "not ideal" but some question "what is the alternative?".Bernadette Southern, chef at restaurant Fleur du Jardin, said: "I think it is very difficult to know where to put it, but it being at the harbour it needs to be lit at certain times."If you're coming off the boat and its full of smoke, it is not very inviting."In a statement, Sark's Douzaine said: "Contrary to the information that may have been provided by Conseiller Makepeace there were plans for a replacement incinerator, however, under the leadership of Conseiller Makepeace, this plan was sidelined in favour of an ‘open pit’ burning approach."The new Douzaine is again looking at a replacement incinerator, unfortunately the opportunity to put money for this in the 2024 budget was lost prior to the new Douzaine taking over."
Guernsey Deputy David de Lisle, a staunch environmental campaigner and former environment minister, said burning waste was also a health hazard."It increases the risks of heart, kidney and liver disease. Impacts people with asthma and people who are prone to headaches."We have also got to remember the soot and pollution aspect as well as the disease promoted by it all, we have to be very concerned."He also believes Sark could be impacting the reputation of the Bailiwick as a whole."Sark is a tourist industry, but is also part of the Channel Islands and it doesn't do the Channel Islands any good have that kind of thing going on."One would expect a tourist island to be pristine on environmental matters."The Douzaine has been asked to respond to Deputy de Lisle's comments.
