Plaid Cymru has expelled a Senedd politician found to have inappropriately touched and sworn at two women while drunk on a party night out.Rhys ab Owen was banned from the Welsh Parliament for six weeks earlier this year - the longest punishment handed out in the Senedd.The party said Mr ab Owen's membership had been terminated following an internal disciplinary process.Mr ab Owen said he would respect the decision. He has previously apologised unreservedly for his actions.
In his investigation, Standards Commissioner Douglas Bain said Mr ab Owen had inappropriately touched the two women on a night out with Plaid Cymru staff and other MSs in June 2021.Mr Bain said that Mr Rhys ab Owen had shown "no remorse" for the events. The Member of the Senedd for South Wales Central, who was elected in 2021, later admitted to the Senedd he had behaved badly and apologised.In a statement, a Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: "Following the publication of the Senedd standards report, there has been an internal disciplinary process within Plaid Cymru. "As a result, his party membership has been terminated, and he will not be eligible to re-apply for a period of at least two years."Mr ab Owen had already been suspended from the party's Senedd group in November 2022, meaning he was sitting as an independent.He had been suspended from the party itself since Mr Bain's findings became known.His punishment would have seen him face a recall petition, and potentially a by-election, had he been an MP.No similar system exists in the Senedd, although the parliament's standards committee is exploring whether one can be brought in when the institution expands from 60 to 96 politicians in 2026.
Mr ab Owen said: “Today’s decision is the culmination of a long process which I hope will now bring the matter to a close. It is a decision I will respect so that my family and I can look to the future."As I have done throughout, I will continue to work with and for my constituency. I am proud to do so and remain fully committed to serving the people of South Wales Central."My wife and children are my priority above all else and I thank them for their enduring love and support."
