The outgoing leader of Nottingham City Council says he does not agree with how his successor was selected.Neghat Khan was chosen to take over from David Mellen, who announced in March he would be stepping down after five years in charge.A Nottingham Labour Group meeting to choose a new leader was scheduled for April, but the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) stepped in to oversee the process.The NEC interviewed six people for the role, but Ms Khan was deemed the only suitable candidate and was installed as the new leader ahead of the meeting.
Mr Mellen said he disagreed with the way in which Labour councillors were not given the opportunity to vote for their leader.He added: "We spend all of our time encouraging people to engage in the democratic process, and for that to be limited in what we're able to do doesn't feel right."We're not the only place where it's happened but we'll get on and importantly deal with the key issues facing the people of Nottingham."He added he would support the new leader, who he says "will do a great job".
Asked if he thought the NEC does not trust Nottingham councillors to choose a new leader, Mr Mellen said he had not spoken to them."They have made that decision. It's been done," he said."We can dwell on it for months or we can get on with the very many issues that face this city and I'm sure that's what Neghat will be concentrating on."Ms Khan is due to formally take over at a meeting on 20 May.She previously said in a statement: "I am delighted to be taking up the roles of leader of Nottingham Labour and Nottingham City Council."We know there are challenges ahead and I look forward to working with colleagues to make positive changes for our city."The Labour-run council effectively declared bankruptcy by issuing a section 114 notice in November, and the government appointed commissioners to help run the authority in February.A Labour Party spokesperson said the NEC interviewed prospective leaders and that it was "not an unusual intervention".
