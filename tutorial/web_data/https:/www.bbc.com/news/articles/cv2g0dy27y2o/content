Northern Ireland’s rising prison population means an extra 75 Prison Service staff will have to be recruited at a cost of £3.5m per year, Justice Minister Naomi Long has announced.A disused cell block at Maghaberry is also being prepared for re-opening as part of contingency planning.The jail currently has 1,245 inmates – almost half of them are on remand, meaning they have not been convicted or sentenced.Mrs Long said the situation is challenging.
Northern Ireland has three prison sites: Maghaberry, Magilligan and Hydebank Wood, which houses women prisoners and young offenders.Over the last three years, inmate numbers across the sites have increased by 500 to 1,900.Mrs Long said: “There has been a very steep rise in recent years, which has been felt particularly at Maghaberry.“Fortunately we have not reached the circumstances which are faced in other jurisdictions.“However, in anticipation of a further rise in numbers, we have readied accommodation and staffing will increase.”The Prison Service has already re-opened two old blocks which had been earmarked for demolition within Maghaberry.
Now a third, known as Lagan House, is set to follow suit.A recruitment campaign for new prison officers will be launched later this year.One feature of the rise in inmates at Maghaberry is more prisoners are sharing cells, a practice known as doubling-up.About 400 prisoners currently share cells.The government recently announced emergency measures to deal with overcrowding in jails in England and Wales, including an early release scheme.Last month the Council of Europe, which monitors human rights compliance, said Ireland is “on the edge of overcrowding” in its prisons.
