Traffic barriers in Exeter are set to be removed in the coming days, Devon County Council has confirmed. Some of the filters on Ladysmith Road, Park Road and St Marks Avenue will be taken away on Wednesday and Thursday. In June, Exeter Highways and Traffic Orders Committee (HATOC) voted to remove the bollards and planters once the school summer term ended. But some will remain to slow traffic.HATOC chair Carol Whitton said she was "pleased some planters were retained to make it easier for the families walking or wheeling their children".
It follows the removal of the same measures on Hamlin Lane, Vaughan Road and Whipton Lane at the start of July.The council said the layout of the roads would be re-instated without a mini-roundabout after the other planters had been removed.The authority also confirmed the revised junction would mean that traffic coming from St Marks Avenue and Park Road would need to give way to motorists travelling between Ladysmith Road and Commins Road.Planters and road markings leftover would narrow the road at the junction to promote traffic calming, the council added. It is hoped this will make it easier for pedestrians to cross the road, compared with the original mini-roundabout. Mrs Whitton added: "I am also pleased that the council will now be talking to all the schools in the area, as well as to local residents and representative groups, about any further measures which might help to calm traffic around the schools and across the area so that all children arrive at school safely."
