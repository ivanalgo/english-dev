A group of women from Gloucestershire have completed a cycling challenge in memory of their friend who died from a brain tumour last year.Lynne Adams was diagnosed with a glioblastoma (GBM) in 2021, and died just 21 months later in 2023 at the age of 68.Her friend, Karen Richardson, 65, tackled a 100-mile cycling challenge alongside the rest of the ‘Chalford Mums’ on Thursday, 18 July, raising money for the charity Brain Tumour Research during Glioblastoma Awareness Week.Ms Richardson said: "We miss Lynne dreadfully, but it’s her memory that kept us going up and down all these hills."
She added: "She would love what we did, and probably think we’re mad for even trying it."In May 2021, Lynne went to see her GP because she was feeling dizzy and tired, but she was told it was labyrinthitis and was given exercises to do.Ms Richardson said: "We kept seeing her get worse and worse, until she was eventually diagnosed a few months later."
"We initially had hope that she would get through it, but she deteriorated so much so quickly," Ms Richardson said. "It was awful to watch someone so intelligent and so vibrant become what she did."She was so lovely and wacky, would always do everything for everybody and always made us laugh."We all managed to say our goodbyes for which we were grateful.”
The group of five ‘Chalford Mums’ first met after all moving into the village at a similar time nearly 30 years ago. Decades of friendship since ensued, with the group doing everything from birthday celebrations to holidays together.The route of the ‘Chalford Chew Cycling Challenge’ in Lynne’s honour saw the women cycle a 100-mile round trip from the village of Chalford to Chew Valley Sailing Club, Lynne’s “happy place”.Community development manager at Brain Tumour Research, Louise Aubrey, said: “Thank you so much to Karen, Julia, Kate, and Christine for their astounding commitment to the cause. "The money they are raising will be vital in helping to fund our search to find a cure for this devastating disease which kills more children and adults under the age of 40 than any other cancer.”
