A 15-year-old boy will be sentenced later for murdering teenager Alfie Lewis in a knife attack.Alfie, also 15, was stabbed in the heart near Horsforth School in Leeds on 7 November 2023, while he was on his way to meet friends.The boy who fatally assaulted him was convicted of murder in May following a two-week trial at Leeds Crown Court.He has not been named throughout the trial for legal reasons.
The court heard that the boy, who was 14 at the time, had taken a knife from a kitchen drawer in his home and used it to stab Alfie.The boy had denied murder and claimed to have been "scared" of Alfie.
He showed no emotion when the verdict was read out in court.Alfie's brother, Antony Lewis, said on behalf of the family: "We miss you and we love you, always."You are always in our hearts and our minds, and until we are all together again keep dancing in the sky our beautiful boy."The judge, Mr Justice Cotter, told the defendant: "You have been found guilty of murder."There is only one sentence I can pass. What I have to determine is how many years you will be detained for before you are able to be released."The judge also has the power upon sentencing to lift the legal restrictions that granted the boy anonymity due to his age.West Yorkshire Police said that Alfie was not involved in gang activity or other crime and was "completely defenceless" when he was attacked.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.
