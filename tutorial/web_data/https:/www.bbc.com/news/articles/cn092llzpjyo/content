Six Derbyshire schools will share almost £5m to create places for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).New classrooms and refurbished indoor and outdoor spaces are to be created to allow existing schools to accommodate extra SEND pupils.The investment of £4,838,000 signed off by Derbyshire County Council is part of a wider £11m plan to increase the number of SEND places by about 500 over five years.Councillor Alex Dale, cabinet member for education, said: “We’ll immediately start spending this initial £5 million to create new school places and improve existing provision for children and young people with SEND - particularly those with more complex needs - and for pupils who require alternative provision which will make a significant impact on their early learning.”
The council said it is investing in existing schools instead of building new SEND facilities to prevent children having to travel as far for schooling.
New classroom buildings are being created at Alfreton Park School, Ashgate Croft School in Chesterfield, while work is also being carried out to allow extra spaces at the existing buildings at Brackenfield SEND School and Stanton Vale School in Long Eaton, Stubbin Wood Nursery in Shirebrook, and Swanwick School and Sports College.Areas with the greatest need of extra SEND provision were identified through council consultations with Derbyshire schools.In April, Chesterfield MP Toby Watkins claimed the council had millions of pounds "sat in the bank" for school spaces for children with special needs, which it could be spending.Mr Dale said: “This is money that can only be spent once, so it needs to be based on detailed work to ensure we provide the right sort of places in the right areas to meet the different demands we face.“This is not easy in a county with a geography like ours and does take time, but we’re making good progress.“We’re committed to giving every Derbyshire child the best possible start in life, whatever their challenge or ability.”In addition to creating extra school places, the council said it is also investing in Enhanced Resource Schools, SEND units, and education outside of school settings.Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
