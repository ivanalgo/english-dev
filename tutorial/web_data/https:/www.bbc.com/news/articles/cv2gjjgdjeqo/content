All residents must start taking their black rubbish bags out of wheelie bins and leave them at the roadside for collection, a council has decided. Rhondda Cynon Taf councillors have approved the plans for all parts of the county from the end of September. The rule is already in place for the Rhondda part of the area, where people can put out a maximum of three standard size (70 litre) bags every three weeks, and it will now be extended to the rest of the county, which includes large towns like Pontypridd and Aberdare.But a petition has already attracted thousands of signatures from people who fear  the changes will attract seagulls and rats.
The plans have been backed by the council cabinet, but several councillors voiced concerns.One spoke of "significant opposition" among residents, and others said people worried about bags being ripped open, rubbish spreading in streets, and vermin.There will be no change to how often waste is collected, the maximum limit of three black bags per household, and collection days and times. But on the day black bags are picked up, they will need to be taken out and left at the kerb.The council said standardising black bag collections would improve the “streetscape” by removing the bins as obstructions. People have complained about bins on footways, especially in narrow terraced streets, the council said. Other benefits, the council added, would be a more efficient waste collection fleet due to standardised vehicles across the county.Also, it said people would not have to haul wheelie bins through homes or over stairs and there would be the possibility of using smaller collection lorries on narrow streets with parked cars. 
Councillor Karen Morgan said there had been "significant opposition" to the proposal which she said was a "material change. She called for the proposal to be subject to a consultation.Councillor Cathy Lisles said people saw the plans as a "backward step",  with the main concerns being increased fly-tipping, bags being ripped open with waste being strewn down the street and bags blowing away in stormy weather.She was pleased the plan was likely to save money, but claimed there had been a lack of consultation with residents and businesses.Councillor Sarah Jane Davies said the main issues raised by people were around vermin, public and environmental health, and rubbish spreading.But cabinet member Gareth Caple said those problems were not happening in Rhondda, where he said the approach was a key reason why it is leading the country in recycling.Councillors were told in a report that "a number of residents" had asked for a "standardised waste collection method for all residents".The changes will also see three-weekly collections from such buildings as schools and businesses.
