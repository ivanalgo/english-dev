The chair of a fire service which was found to have an underlying culture of sexism and misogyny has come under fire from MPs.Dorset & Wiltshire Fire & Rescue Service (DWFRS) chair, councillor Rebecca Knox, was questioned by the Home Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday.Labour chair of the committee Dame Diana Johnson said she was "surprised" Ms Knox had not met any female firefighters who reported harassment and bullying.Ms Knox said it would not have been appropriate to "seek out" victims if they did not feel comfortable, but said anyone could speak to her if they wanted to.
Dame Diana responded: "I find that attitude as someone in a position of responsibility incredible - that you do not think you have the role of asking questions and talking to firefighters."Following an ITV report in 2023, an independent review found dozens of DWFRS employees were aware of inappropriate behaviour and persistent offenders were not being properly dealt with. Ms Knox was asked why a review was only commissioned after the media coverage, given the authority had already been aware of some issues. 
She told the committee action was taken before the review on individual cases which had been reported to DWFRS.Asked how she felt about what happened in the fire service and whether she was remorseful, Ms Knox said she felt a "great sadness" about the culture revealed in the report.She continued: "I personally feel responsible because I really care for the fire and rescue service."I really, really want to do the right thing," she added.Ms Knox said she was "absolutely" willing to listen to any victims who wanted to come forward and speak to her.
