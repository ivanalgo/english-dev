A former student at a university which has axed its free inter-campus bus service has said it will limit disabled students academically and socially.Becky Dutneall from Wylde Green, who studied sociology and social policy at the University of Wolverhampton, used the bus to get to its various campuses.The university is spread over four main campuses in Wolverhampton, Walsall, Telford and Burton, and said it had taken the "difficult decision" to prioritise spending elsewhere.Ms Dutneall, 45, told the BBC: "I think it's saying they don't actually believe in their tagline, 'opportunities for all'. Don't disabled people factor into that?
"Before I applied to the university, I was told it had a wonderful reputation for supporting students with disabilities."But no, they don't. We're not as important, we're not factored in."Ms Dutneall would use the free bus to get to the Wolverhampton campus for lectures and to the Walsall campus for choir practice.Students also travel to the Walsall campus to use its swimming pool and gym, which Ms Dutneall said is considerably cheaper than mainstream gyms."It will limit students academically and socially, especially those with disabilities and those who don't drive," she said."It seems they consider the majority of students to be able to access alternative transport."
If Ms Dutneall, who has a health condition, had had to rely on public transport as a student, she would have had to do longer walks to get to campus, which she would have struggled with.She also found it difficult to find a place to sit on public transport due to "chronic overcrowding."The university said it had taken the "difficult decision" to stop the service which runs between Wolverhampton, Walsall and Telford from 31 July.A spokesperson for the university said: "We have looked closely at the usage data which shows that each bus trip is costing the university approximately Â£10. "Our priority is to enhance the student academic experience and invest in student services and facilities on campus, which makes this cost difficult to justify. "We are working closely with staff and students who use the bus service to ensure they are supported in finding alternative ways to travel between our campuses."However, Ms Dutneall said the university had not consulted staff or students about the change."They've not asked people affected by it, which should be the minimum," she said.
