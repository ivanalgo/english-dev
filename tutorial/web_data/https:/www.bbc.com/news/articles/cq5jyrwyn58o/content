Serious failings in the running of a prestigious boarding school in North Yorkshire exposed children to the risk of sexual abuse, a report has found.The Charity Commission started an inquiry into the two trusts responsible for the running of Catholic private school Ampleforth College and neighbouring Ampleforth Abbey.The investigation was triggered by allegations in 2016 of sexual abuse committed against pupils by monks and staff which later turned out to be true.The report found “significant weaknesses” in the safeguarding, governance and management of the St Laurence Educational Trust (SLET) and the Ampleforth Abbey Trust (AAT).
AAT said it welcomed the Charity Commission’s report and apologised to those who  had suffered abuse.Ampleforth College is a co-educational independent school for pupils aged 13 to 18 with annual boarding fees of about £33,000.It was founded in the 19th Century by the neighbouring Benedictine abbey.SLET runs Ampleforth College while the AAT manages the work of Ampleforth Abbey.Both are located on the same site and share a close relationship based on their proximity and charitable purpose.Abbey monks also provide chaplaincy and teaching to pupils at the college. In 2018, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse found there had been a “culture of acceptance of abusive behaviour” at the college.The Charity Commission's inquiry was opened to assess both charities’ approach to safeguarding, including their practices and procedures, and how they ensured a safe environment for children.While carrying out investigations, the commission was told of a further nine previously unreported serious abuse allegations recorded at the school between 2014 and 2016.It said both at the time of the inquiry and throughout its duration, it found  "serious weaknesses" in the charities' approach to, and management of, safeguarding, which exposed children at the college "to unnecessary risk" and "harm".
In relation to SLET, the report concluded there were "repeated serious failures" in the way the trust dealt with safeguarding incidents.The report went ont to detail the school’s repeated failures to pass inspections carried out by the Independent Schools Inspectorate and Ofsted.Amy Spiller, head of investigations at the commission, said: "We expect safeguarding to be a priority for all charities, and the lack of oversight demonstrated mismanagement in the administration of these charities."She said they recognised the progress made by both charities during the inquiry including compliance with regulatory standards."But the findings of our inquiry underscored the importance of maintaining high safeguarding standards and rebuilding public trust," she added.Since an inspection in late 2023 Ampleforth has been rated “good” by Ofsted.In repsonse, SLET said it was "grateful for the support that the commission has given in helping us identify and address failings in the safeguarding regime for Ampleforth College."It added: "We share the commission’s objective that our beneficiaries should be safe at all times. "We have worked very hard to put a regime and culture in place that delivers outstanding safeguarding and pastoral care and will continue to do so."In a statement, AAT said: "The Abbot of Ampleforth Abbey would like to take this opportunity to offer sincere and heartfelt apology to anyone who suffered abuse while in the care of our schools, parishes, or other ministries."Throughout this inquiry, the trustees have co-operated with the commission and have worked hard, with the help and guidance of many professionals, to learn from past mistakes and to ensure that a positive and professional safeguarding culture is embedded in all of the abbey’s works."Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
