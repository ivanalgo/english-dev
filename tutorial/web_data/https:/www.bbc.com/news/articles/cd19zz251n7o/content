A new council leader has been appointed after the previous boss was elected as the area's MP.Jacky Alty was elected by members of South Ribble Borough Council to take over from Paul Foster.Mr Foster won the South Ribble constituency seat for Labour at the general election.Ms Alty, who has previously been champion for social justice and a cabinet member for licensing, said it was an "honour" and wished her predecessor all the best in his new role.
Mr Foster had been the leader of South Ribble's local authority for five years.In his final address before handing over the baton, he said his departure was a "bittersweet moment", but told the meeting he "couldn’t possibly" carry out the duties of both MP and council leader.Ms Alty has represented the Farington East ward since she first became a member of the council in 2019 – the year Labour seized control of the borough from the Conservatives after 12 years. She was immediately appointed to the newly-created role of social justice and equality champion, which she held until May last year when she became the cabinet member for licensing, social justice and equality and diversity.In her first speech as leader, she said: "The task of leading such a wonderful council comes with great responsibility, but I am excited for the future and I am confident, alongside my brilliant team of fellow elected members, we can continue to drive forward projects and programmes which will benefit all those across our communities."
