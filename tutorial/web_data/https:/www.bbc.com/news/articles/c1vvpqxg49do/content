Students in Huddersfield have said planned cuts on campus have left them feeling "let down" by the town's university.Last month it was confirmed nearly 200 jobs were to be axed at the University of Huddersfield, as well as a number of courses.Students told the BBC they were concerned about the impact the cuts could have on their academic futures, with some considering transfers to other universities.The university said the job cuts were a "proactive effort to secure a dynamic and sustainable future" during a "financial crisis" in higher education.
The cuts come following a previous restructure at the institution.The university said "voluntary schemes" had previously been used "to navigate ongoing financial pressures".However, it "must now implement a transformational change programme", reducing the workforce by 12%.
Ellie Croot, 31, is an English literature student at the university.She had planned to continue her higher education at Masters level but is now considering transferring universities.Due to job cuts proposed on her course, she is worried the quality of her education will be affected.Ms Croot said she "consistently gets first-class grades" which she believed were integral to her ambition of future study."The only way I will be considered for postgraduate study at a Russell Group university is if I come away with the best classification."I just don't think that's going to happen if I don't have the correct supervision for my dissertation. "I feel as though we've been sold a very expensive lie; if those lecturers lose their positions then the remaining lecturers will be stretched and strained."We've been sold a course and now the course is not going to be as promised."
At least 12 courses are expected to be cut at the university, including geography, sociology, maths and the MSci health and social care qualification.Megan Horner, 21, is undertaking a third-year film studies degree.She said she felt "really let down" by the university."I came here because of how impressed I was with its reputation and I just feel really disappointed that this is what it's come to."Ms Horner said she "used to be really proud" to say that she went to the University of Huddersfield because she knew that it carried a "weight behind it" but now she was about to graduate, she was "not as proud any more"."I know that when I tell someone that I've graduated from the University of Huddersfield they're going to know that my degree wasn't what I thought it was going to be."
The university insisted its "commitment to educational excellence remains unwavering".Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram. Send your story ideas to yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk.
