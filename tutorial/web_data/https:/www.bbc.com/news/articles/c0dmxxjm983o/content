A West Sussex council has decided to end the lease on its current offices.Horsham District Council wants to move closer to the town centre, so has terminated the lease on its Parkside offices in Chart Way.It plans to move to a new site in the Swan Walk shopping centre.The authority said this would be more central and help it achieve its aim of being carbon neutral by 2030, with its new home being more energy efficient.
It intends to take out a 25-year lease on the Sierra Place building in Springfield Road.Council leader Martin Boffey said: "Relocating our staff to this more fit-for-purpose, centrally based building will make us more accessible to residents, in more energy efficient space which supports our sustainability targets."As a modern, forward-thinking authority, it is vital that we occupy office space which correctly supports the core public services we provide."The decision was passed unanimously by the full council on 29 May, with the move set to happen early in 2025.
