A woman has spoken of the "wonderful” feeling to have her missing cat home... four years after he went missing.Alison Woodrow from Orton Goldhay in Peterborough works at Cats Protection Peterborough and District.Her own moggy, Mojo, was only four-weeks old when he was rescued and taken in by her but went missing, aged two, in 2020.Ms Woodrow had given up hope of his safe return so was amazed when Mojo was found safe and well - just a seven-minute walk from his old home.
Ms Woodrow recalled when Mojo went missing and said: “He went for a walk in 2020 one summer evening…we were shouting for Mojo around the block and couldn’t find him.”On Tuesday, the vet informed Ms Woodrow that Mojo - who was microchipped - had been found and since then he has been settling back in.“I rushed in my car with my cat carrier went and it was him.“When I brought him home he didn’t know where he was.“I had him for two years and he was missing for four years. “It’s all a bit weird and bit of an adjustment.”
She assumed her freewheeling feline went to live with someone else who would  probably be missing him now. "He looks really well fed and he is glossy- he has been much loved so it’s nice to know," she added.
