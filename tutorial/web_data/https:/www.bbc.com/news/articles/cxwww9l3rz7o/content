A former football manager has said being charged with drugs offences "pushed me to the edge".The case against Matt Clarke, who stood down as manager of Redditch United after the charges were brought in February, was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) on Friday.Mr Clarke was accused of supplying cocaine and cannabis and possessing an offensive weapon.The CPS told Worcester Crown Court that after a review it would not be proceeding with the case against the 50-year-old from Bromsgrove.
Mr Clarke said he was arrested after he accepted a lift from a friend, who picked up another passenger in Hereford, who it turned out was being watched by police."Within a few minutes, police surrounded the car... and the next thing I knew I was in custody."Mr Clarke said it transpired the friend and the man he had picked up had previously been involved in drugs, something he had been unaware of, and all three were charged with the same offences."I was just completely in shock," said the 50-year-old, who said he had "never been arrested for anything in my life."
He said there was no evidence against him, other than being in a vehicle, which a solicitor described as being in the wrong place at the wrong time.It had been incredibly expensive to defend himself, costing more than Â£15,000 in legal fees, some of which he said he hoped to recover."It's pushed me to the edge with having to deal with everything and the financial pressures."I've had it from all angles really."
After it was confirmed the case was being withdrawn, he said he shed "more than a tear."When charges were brought in February, Redditch United announced Mr Clarke had taken an "immediate break" from his role due to "personal reasons".He said he was "under no illusions" that to continue in football would be difficult, and would require a "brave chairman," but if there was an opportunity in the game, he would take it."My ambition is to first of all secure my job, my family, and make sure everybody around me is OK."Mr Clarke said his arrest had highlighted that "this could happen to absolutely anybody."His two co-defendants pleaded guilty to drugs charges and will be sentenced on 25 August.
