A former bank is set to be converted into seven flats.Developer Klara 89 Limited has applied for a part change of use and some construction at the former Lloyds Bank on Billericay's High Street.Lloyds had occupied the building since the 1950s but shut it in November 2022.Basildon Council's planning committee is set to agree the plans at a meeting this week.
The council officers' report said the development would keep some retail space on the ground floor and would "have no adverse impact upon designated heritage assets in the vicinity of the application site and would preserve the character of the Conservation Area".They added the properties would contribute to the council's five-year housing supply, while "enabling the efficient re-use of an underused vacant former bank premises and retaining a commercial frontage".The town council objected to the proposals on the grounds of over-development of the site, an increase in traffic and the overlooking of neighbouring properties, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.Billericay District Residents' Association and two residents also objected on similar grounds.Andy Barnes, the Conservative councillor for Billericay East, said he did not have "intrinsic objections" to new homes in the High Street, but "seven flats does seem a lot on that site".A spokesman for Klara Homes said it had "worked proactively" with the council's planning and heritage officers throughout the planning process."The existing building has been noticeably vacant for some time," it said."We believe the benefits of delivering much-needed housing alongside a regenerated commercial space in the centre of Billericay town centre will be a substantial benefit to all residents and local business owners."
