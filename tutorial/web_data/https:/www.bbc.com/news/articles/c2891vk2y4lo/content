A review is being launched of the services provided at four community hospitals in the Scottish Borders.It comes just two weeks after BBC Scotland revealed that beds could be closed at the Duns, Kelso, Hawick and Peebles sites due to staffing issues.In a statement, the region's Health and Social Care Partnership said the review was necessary to ensure the community hospitals were "fit for the future".It stressed there were "no plans at present" to change community hospital provision prior to the conclusion of the review.
NHS Borders chief executive Ralph Roberts said it would consider the "changing needs of our population and the way in which health and social care should be provided to best meet these needs"."One element of the review is the provision of medical cover in community hospitals to ensure that it is sustainable," he said."The review will help us to redesign our services to provide sustainable, high quality care for the long term."He said it was being carried out "openly and transparently with the participation of  our staff and communities".He added that the process was in its "very early stages" and updates would be provided.
