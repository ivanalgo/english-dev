A man has been jailed for 14 years for killing a pedestrian in a road rage attack.Jake McIntyre, 29,  hit Andrew Peart with a metal wheel brace after the pair squared off against each other in Guide Post, Northumberland, last August.Mr Peart, 39, sustained "catastrophic brain injuries" and died in hospital eight days later. McIntyre was sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court after jurors found him guilty of manslaughter following a two-and-a-half-week trial in May.
Following the sentencing, Mr Peart's family paid tribute to a "loving family man" who was a devoted father, brother, son, and friend.
McIntyre, of Stakeford, in Ashington, had claimed he had been acting in self-defence.
He had been driving to the Co-op store in Guide Post and had to slow down as Mr Peart crossed the road.The court was told McIntyre sounded his horn, prompting an angry retort from Mr Peart and the pair had an argument.McIntyre drove away but then returned and caught up with Mr Peart before hitting him with the metal brace he had in his car. He then punched Mr Peart and left the scene.McIntyre was arrested two days later after fleeing to the Cumbria area.
Det Ch Insp Graeme Barr, from Northumbria Police, said: "This one incident has left one manâ€™s life tragically cut short and another man jailed for a significant amount of time. "This has left the families of both men having to pick up the pieces and for no reason other than this display of unnecessary and avoidable aggression."
