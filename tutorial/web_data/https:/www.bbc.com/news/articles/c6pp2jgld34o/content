A champion equestrian from Kent who died after falling from her horse has been remembered by family and friends at her funeral.Georgie Campbell, from Cranbrook, was just 36 when she fell from Global Quest while at the Bicton International Horse Trials in Devon on 21 May.It was standing room only once the 700-strong congregation filled St Dunstan’s Church for Georgie’s memorial service on Tuesday.The rider’s death has “torn a hole” in the eventing world, said friend Tom McEwen.
“We all feel such a massive loss, it's a small world, we've lost an incredible community,” he said.“She was the most fantastic rider. She did it all off her own back, she worked hard, tirelessly.”Well-wishers wore Georgie’s riding colours of purple and white as they paid their respects.
Georgie’s sister, Jo Williams, said: "Georgie was always fun. In later life she was the one I always wanted to sit next to at family dinners, I knew we'd just have such a good giggle.“Despite it being her career, she still loved her horses - she never pushed them to do more than she thought they were capable of, she really cared for them in a sweet way."Georgie’s family now hopes to set up a foundation in her name to make horse riding more accessible to people from all backgrounds.
