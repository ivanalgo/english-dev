A Scottish college has become the first in the country to enter into a partnership with gaming giant PlayStation.North East Scotland College (Nescol) is part of the PlayStation First global academic scheme - which allows access to development tools, technology and support from Sony. Nescol said the courses in Aberdeen and Fraserburgh - which start in the summer - could make careers in the gaming industry a viable option for people in the area.Abertay University in Dundee also has access to the programme. Nescol already provides entry-level and HND courses in Games Development, while there are future plans for an Esports arena. 
The PlayStation First scheme allows games to be made directly for the console and students can use the same hardware that game studios use around the world. Zack Anderson, academic improvement lead for computing at Nescol, said he hoped it could give more young people the chance to learn about their industry nearer to home. He said: "We get a lot of students that are coming straight out of school and maybe they are not ready to move away."So it gives them the opportunity to stay local, learn their trade and not have to go too far to get their hands on this kind of technology."
