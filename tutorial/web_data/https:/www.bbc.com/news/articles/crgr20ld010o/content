Calls for a new minister of Cornwall have been made by the county's leaders.Councillor Linda Taylor and Lord Hutton, chairman of the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Economic Forum, wrote to the prime minister saying the new role would be "pivotal" in making the Duchy stronger.The council leader said she hoped a minister would result in a change to income and an increase in jobs.Ms Taylor said: "The Council of Europe clearly recognises the legality of Cornwall as a nation and that recognition is given to Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and they do have ministers."
Cornwall Council said the letter also called for fairer funding going forwards. In 2015, Cornwall became the first county to sign a devolution deal.Two years later, a Â£360m agreement was signed to give the Duchy more powers, but the deal failed to launch and was scaled down in 2023.The council abandoned plans to pursue a devolution deal with an elected mayor due to public opposition.Cornwall's existing devolution deals cover areas including transport and renewable energy.The council said any further powers need to come with extra money, more in line with the national average.Labour MP Jayne Kirkham for Truro and Falmouth said it was up to the prime minister to decide who he appoints as ministers. But Ms Kirkham said she was "very, very keen for more devolution for Cornwall".
