A 13-year-old wants young people to work together to help end homelessness in Nottingham.Isa has been elected as the first youth patron of Nottingham-based charity Framework, a role that it hopes will encourage young people to assist the homeless through fundraising and education.He said he "had to help" after members of his family were left homeless in the aftermath of Turkey’s earthquakes in February 2023.Framework said it was impressed by Isa's work in the community so far, and young people like him were the "future" of the organisation.
Isa, from Gedling, has been involved in helping homeless people for the last three years, including taking part in Framework's "Big Sleep Out" where people experience rough sleeping for themselves.But when he heard the news about his family's situation in Turkey, he said it made him even more determined to help.The 13-year-old said: "I woke up the morning after [the first earthquakes] and my parents told me what happened."My grandmother and uncle's houses were destroyed - I was scared for them and where they would live."I have always cared about homeless people, but now I have a greater understanding of what they might be going through."The United Nations says about 1.5m people lost their homes in the disaster and more than 50,000 people were killed.
Isa has already started drafting up fundraising plans in his new role, including a "virtual sleep-out".He added: "Any young person can sleep in their garden for a few nights and raise money this way. I also want to speak to students in schools about what they can do to help."Speaking to BBC Radio Nottingham, Matt Cooke, Framework's fundraising manager said: "Isa’s contribution to Framework by raising money and awareness has been enormous."He is demonstrating the impact young people can have in their local community."We are so proud of him and cannot wait to see what he achieves in this new and exciting role."Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
