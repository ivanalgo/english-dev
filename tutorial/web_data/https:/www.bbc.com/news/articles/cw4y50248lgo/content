More children on Teesside are to be automatically enrolled on to a new scheme offering free school meals. Redcar and Cleveland Council said it wanted to increase the number of eligible pupils registering in a bid to save families money.It comes after Middlesbrough Council introduced a pilot in a bid to stop youngsters who qualify from slipping through the net.Labour's Bill Suthers, cabinet member for children and families, said it would have a "big positive impact" for many hundreds of families, as currently people have to opt-in.
The pilot will begin in September in line with the new school year, the Labour-led authority said.It added that parents and guardians also have the option to opt-out.
According to The Child Poverty Action Group, 10% of eligible families miss out on free school meals nationally and that figure is slightly higher in the North East at  11%.The council claimed those eligible would save about £400 a year, per child.Mr Suthers added: "It’s not only about making sure every child receive a good, daily meal but also the impact for families in the school holidays and the schools which will receive more government funding."It’s been tested elsewhere in the country and has provable benefits. It’s an excellent scheme.”
Greater enrolment could lead to extra government funding amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds for schools across the borough.This is because schools receive extra "pupil premium" funding based on the number of free school meal children they have. In June, Middlesbrough announced it would take part in the same pilot.Letters will be sent out to eligible households in the Redcar and Cleveland area in the coming days.
