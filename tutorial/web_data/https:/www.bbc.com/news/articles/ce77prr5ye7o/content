Thousands of Muslims across the West Midlands have been celebrating Eid-al-Adha, a festival which marks the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.Green Lane Mosque in Birmingham cancelled its event in Small Heath Park, due to the weather, but volunteer Haniya Aadam said it was "uplifting to see the turnout" as people prayed on the street.It was a different story in Wolverhampton's West Park, where thousands celebrated and prayed together.Known as the "festival of sacrifice", Eid-al-Adha is time where Muslims honour and reflect on the Prophet Ibrahim though prayer and charity work.
"It's really wonderful, I mean it's different but to see the crowds like this in an intense way, it really gives you that spiritual boost," Ms Aadam added.Dr Adbul Haqq Baker, CEO of Green Lane Mosque, said this year's celebrations were particularly special as conflicts continue across the world."The spirit of Hajj is one of sacrifice, devotion and thinking of others when we look at what's happening around the world today especially in the Middle East having thoughts and sensitives to those who are less fortunate than ourselves," he said.
