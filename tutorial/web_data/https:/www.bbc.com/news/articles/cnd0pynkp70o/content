Villagers living close to a new housing development say it will have a "major impact" on an already stretched GP practice.More than 5,000 homes are being built at the Great Haddon development on Peterborough City Council land, just outside Yaxley.But residents say the developer, Vistry Group, has not made provision for additional services, including another GP practice, which will affect "our first-class Lakeside surgery".A spokesperson for the NHS Cambridgeshire & Peterborough Integrated Care System (CPICS) said: "We are working closely with the local authority to support the access to healthcare services for existing and new residents."
Paul Underwood, a member of the local Patient Participation Group, said patients were already seeing "significant waits" for the existing service, which serves about 20,000 patients.
A spokesperson for Lakeside Healthcare at Yaxley said: "Local NHS commissioners and CPICS make decisions on new practices."We have been in touch with them and would be happy to support the patients of Great Haddon when a decision is made."Vistry Group did not wish to comment to the BBC about health infrastructure concerns.
Yaxley Parish Council (YPC) has also shared its "frustrations" over the ongoing issue of drainage and flooding in the area.The developer has been given permission by Peterborough City Council to discharge excess surface water into the Yaxley watercourse.Helen Taylor, clerk at YPC said there had been flooding recorded "pretty much every week" since last October. "The pipe discharging the surface water is not big enough to take that level of water," she said."We are just being ignored."
A statement from the developer said: "Vistry has obtained all necessary discharge consent and permissions."We have been engaging with all stakeholders to find a suitable solution to the concerns raised by Yaxley Parish Council and this is ongoing.”Peterborough City Council has been contacted for a comment.
Andrew Wood, a Yaxley parish and Cambridgeshire county councillor added: "We are asking them to play a hand and increase the amenities – for drainage facilities and health which are the biggest concerns."The addition of at least 5,000 homes is pushing it beyond breaking point.“And we can’t see anything being put in place."Mr Underwood said: "We need a commitment for a new health centre."The GP is a first class practice but we don’t want it to go downhill."
