A council is investigating after people ended up in hospital following Brazilian butt lift procedures.Brentwood Borough Council in Essex wants to hear from anyone in the area who has had the non-surgical work done.The procedure - also known as BBL or Liquid BBL - which uses a hyaluronic acid filler, is not illegal but is currently unregulated and can be fatal if not performed properly.The council said "an individual and associated companies" in Brentwood had been banned from carrying out BBL procedures until any risks had been "controlled".
Environmental health officers were "investigating cases of hospitalisation due to members of the public undergoing a non-surgical aesthetic procedure, commonly known as a Brazilian Butt Lift, BBL or Liquid BBL in Brentwood," the council said.The authority has not named the firms involved or revealed how many patients have been hospitalised.
It is working with other local authorities and industry experts after a flurry of cases raised concern, including reports of treatment being carried out in hotel rooms.A spokesperson from Brentwood Borough Council said: "Individuals who have undergone these procedures have experienced excruciating pain, discomfort and infections, some of which have required medical interventions and hospitalisation."They urged anyone experiencing symptoms to "seek medical assistance immediately".
Brazilian butt lifts, or BBLs, are procedures designed to make buttocks bigger, more rounded or lifted.Those carrying out the lifts insert silicone-filled implants and/or inject fat transferred from other parts of the body.In 2019, a woman from Norfolk died at a private hospital in Istanbul while undergoing the procedure.The surgery, as with many cosmetic procedures, can be expensive, but liquid or non-surgical BBLs are a cheaper option.In that version, hyaluronic acid, which is used in dermal fillers, is injected to manipulate the size and/or shape of the area.But if not performed in a proper way, it can lead to serious health complications.
Brentwood Borough Council is urging people "to undertake extensive research" before opting for BBL."If the cost of the treatment is lower than the market average, proceed with caution as the practitioner may not be using the products advertised," a spokesperson said."Please be aware that non-surgical aesthetic procedures still require a sterile clinical environment, therefore procedures should be performed in appropriate treatment rooms."If you have concerns or doubts about the procedure, contact us."
