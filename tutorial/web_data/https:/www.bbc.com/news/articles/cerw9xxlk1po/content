Dramatic footage has been released showing the moment when officers rescued people from a burning block of flats.The fire broke out at Emperor's Gate in South Kensington, west London, just after midnight on Friday, 1 March. About 160 people were evacuated from the five-storey block and seven police officers were among 13 people who were taken to hospital. The Met Police said a 25-year-old man has been charged on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life and remained in custody. 
The body worn footage, released by the Met, shows police officers kicking down the front door to enter the block. After getting through the front door, officers then gained access to six flats to rescue those inside. Fifteen fire engines and about 100 firefighters also attended the scene, rescuing those still trapped.Supt Jill Horsfall, one of the senior officers responsible for policing Kensington & Chelsea, said: “The bravery and professionalism of the Met officers who responded so rapidly to this terrifying fire shows the very best of policing. "They acted without hesitation to rapidly enter a burning building full of smoke and to save lives.“Our subsequent investigation will be equally tenacious."
Police said the arrested man was due before Westminster magistrates later. The officers and six residents taken to hospital suffered smoke inhalation during the fire, but none suffered more serious injuries. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea said it was continuing to support and assist those affected by the fire and had set up website for residents to get help and information.
