An abandoned home in Stroud is being brought back into use after years of sitting empty.Environmental health officers found ferns were growing inside the three-bedroom property and the structure had been badly damaged by years of neglect.When attempts to engage with the owner failed, Stroud District Council applied for a county court order to force the sale of the house.The building, which needs extensive renovations, has now been sold at auction.
“There is a shortage of housing in the district, so we will do all we can to encourage empty homes to be brought back into use,” said councillor Mattie Ross, chair of the council's housing committee.“We offer homeowners an interest-free empty momes loan of up to £15,000 for repairs and refurbishment to properties that have been empty for more than 12 months if they are then used for affordable rented housing.”Councillor Lucas Schoemaker, committee vice chair, added: “Long-term empty homes are a blight for communities and can attract anti-social behaviour.”The authority agreed last month to implement a council tax premium on second homes in the area, and widen the current council tax premium for properties empty for between one and five years, to encourage more homes to be brought into use.The new rules will come into force from April 2025.
