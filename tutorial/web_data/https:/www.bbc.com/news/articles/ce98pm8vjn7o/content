Safety measures are being introduced on a Worcestershire road that has been the scene of several fatal crashes in recent years.Worcestershire County Council said, following a review of the A456 Bewdley Bypass, it would implement a temporary 50mph limit and a no-overtaking order.Campaigner Libby Marshall welcomed the news and said it was step towards making the road safer.She said: "We as a community have been heard. When you've got 900 people signing the petition you can't ignore it."
However, she said the important thing was to see if the measures worked.A number of deaths have occurred on the bypass in recent years, with the latest coming after a motorcycle was involved in a crash with a van last month.The council said a permanent solution would be submitted for the bypass, while the current temporary 30mph speed limit on Collow Hill would be extended past Wyre Forest visitor centre and become permanent.There are also plans to reduce the speed limit on the A456 from Long Bank to the safari park to 50mph.The local authority said the temporary limits would remain in place for six to nine months while they went through the legal process to become permanent.
