An MP has written to Thames Water about "deep concern regarding the ongoing sewage issues" in his local area.Newbury MP Lee Dillon said it was "unacceptable" that the chalk streams in and around his Berkshire constituency were being "subjected to continual pollution".He urged the company to implement a "comprehensive" plan to tackle the issue, as well as to meet regularly with councils, agencies and community groups.A spokesperson for Thames Water said the operator had an "ambitious" five-year plan to reduce river pollution and upgrade infrastructure.
In the letter, Mr Dillon said it was his "duty" as the new MP to address the problems due to "inadequate sewage infrastructure and frequent sewage discharges".He cited three issues - the fact that some Thames Water monitors were "offline during critical periods" meaning the duration of sewage discharges was sometimes unknown, the environmental impact, and the effects on local residents.He acknowledged the "constraints under which Thames Water is operating" but said they needed to implement "proactive measures to mitigate these issues"."The situation is at a crisis point and requires urgent and decisive action," he said.
Several places in Berkshire experienced problems with sewage and flooding during winter and spring, including Hampstead Norreys, Lambourn, Cookham and Newbury.Sami Gabriel, whose house is beside the River Lambourn and was flooded over the winter, said it was "considerably better" now water levels had fallen but he was currently having to live elsewhere so the property could be repaired.And Sam Marshall, a river keeper for the River Kennet, said the environmental damage from sewage discharges lasts "a long time"."You can see sewage fungus growing in the river... it's just choking the river throughout the year," he said.
A spokesperson for Thames Water said their plan included "record investment" to "improve the resilience of our critical infrastructure", and that they were "working hard to keep our sewers flowing" in the face of a "significant" amount of water in the system."We are sorry that customers have been affected by this and want them to know we are here to provide support," the spokesperson added.
