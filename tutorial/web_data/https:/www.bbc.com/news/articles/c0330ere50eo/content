A 14-year-old girl undergoing treatment for a brain tumour has been gifted VIP box tickets for a Taylor Swift concert after the event organiser withdrew the two she was originally offered.Mali Edge, from Colwyn Bay, north Wales, was diagnosed with medulloblastoma last November and was coming to the end of her radiotherapy treatment when a charity donated the tickets to her.She was nominated by staff at Christie hospital in Manchester, who remembered Mali would listen to Taylor Swift before her treatment sessions there.For unknown reasons the tickets were withdrawn by event organisers with just a week to go to the concert, but social media posts by her family resulted in overwhelming support - with the posts getting more than seven million views and a retweet by ex-footballer Jamie Carragher.
Two strangers to Mali, fellow Swiftie Ella, from Liverpool, and former Liverpool boxer Paul Smith, spotted Mali's story and managed to not only get her tickets - but to get her upgraded to VIP box seats for the concert at Anfield stadium.After the posts on social media by Mali's dad and aunt, Ella got in touch with the family and offered her own tickets to Mali and her mum, Catrin.Mali's dad said Ella's generosity was "extraordinary"."We were willing to pay," he said, "I went looking for resale and there was nothing available. "Within an hour, this amazing lady, Ella, gave up her own tickets.""Mali is over the moon," said Mr Edge."I want to thank the people who have helped, their generosity is wonderful."He said the "amazing" gesture has really given his daughter a lift, after a very tough seven months."She's at an age where she should be blossoming, out with her friends, but she can't do that."The concert would be a boost for his "gentle, unassuming, determined and loveable" daughter, he said."The most important thing is that she gets there and has the time of her life."
Delyth Crisp, who is Mali's aunty, said Mali was devastated to hear the tickets had been withdrawn, as she was determined to build up the strength to go to the concert.She said: "It was devastating for her, she's been really looking forward to it."Since the diagnosis, she's lost her confidence."She's a lovely, sweet, hilarious and wonderful girl, who's going through something that would floor most adults."Going to the concert was what she was aiming to get out and do."Mali's aunty added: "We didn't think for a minute we'd have that amount of reach and support."As a family we are so incredibly grateful."It was a sad situation but it quickly turned into a really lovely one."It was overshadowed by everyone's kindness and generosity."Mali will go straight to Alder Hey Children's hospital after the concert on Friday and will start her third round of chemotherapy the following day.Mr Edge praised all the medical staff involved in Mali's treatment to date and said the signs were "positive".
