There are fears a long established Roman Catholic church could close permanently.St Peter’s in South Bank, Middlesbrough, has been described as unsafe, with the estimated cost of repairs running in excess of £1m.South Bank ward councillor Neil Bendelow said closing the building would be a "travesty".The Diocese of Middlesbrough said no decision on the future of the church, which was completed in 1905, had been made.
An inspection report identified various required works to the church on Middlesbrough Road, including rewiring, repairs to ceilings, floors and windows and fully stripping and replacing the roof.A suggested outline budget put the cost at £1.055m, although a figure of up to £1.5m has also been quoted, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Councillor Bendelow claimed the diocese was attempting to “keep any opposition to the closure quiet”.He said: “Closing a substantial building with such historic value such as St Peter’s, without any opportunity for other organisations to utilise the building, is a travesty.”In a statement the Diocese of Middlesbrough said there was a “substantial” cost required to upgrade the building.It was listening to opinions and suggestions in weighing up how to move forward, while informing the community of the present situation.No specific timescale was being worked to in terms of next steps.A report prepared for the diocese and released in March last year said architecturally St Peter’s was one of the two finest Catholic churches in Middlesbrough, but had not been reopened for worship since pandemic restrictions ended. “The resident population has declined in recent years and the church is currently served by one priest, based at St Andrew, Teesville," the report said.“After local discussion, the Bishop is considering closure of the church.”
