A football club which created its first girls' team a year ago said it has become even more popular following the success of the Lionesses.The Marske United FC Girls' under-11 team has a full squad of 14 members who play in a competitive league.Coach and parent Steven Pippen said: "Before, girls only had the option of joining the boys team or not playing at all".There are now twice as many registered female football teams in England as there were seven years ago, BBC analysis has found.
The girls' team, the first in Marske United FC's history, had 10 players sign up when it was founded.Mr Pippen said: "After the Euros and the World Cup there was a lot more interest in girls' football."They see the women on the telly and they've got role models they can relate to."There are a few of the local heroes like Beth Mead who the girls can relate to, especially when you know they've come from a similar area, it just makes that dream a bit more achievable."
The players said they watched women's matches and supported the Lionesses."We're more fast-paced," said Holly, 11.Phoebe, 10, said: "I feel quite proud because I'm on the first girls' football team at Marske United."Lottie, 9, added: "I just like kicking the ball, it's fun."
