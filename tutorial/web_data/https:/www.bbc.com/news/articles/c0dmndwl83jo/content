Saltdean Lido is to close for two days for the filming of a new TV series inspired by a Nick Cave novel. In a post on social media the Grade II-listed lido, based in Saltdean, Brighton, said it would be closed on 1 and 2 July for a "large-scale film production shoot". The pool and cafe will be closed, but season ticket holders will be allowed to swim between 07:00 and 09:00 BST on both days, it said. The lido said it would earn "significant financial incentives" as a result of the shoot which it would invest in its "facilities, equipment, programme and staff". 
A publicist confirmed to the BBC the filming is in relation to a new Sky Original series. The six-part series, entitled "The Death of Bunny Munro", is based on an adaptation of Australian singer and writer Nick Cave's 2009 dark comic novel. The Crown and House of the Dragon actor Matt Smith is set to star in, and executive produce, the series. In the post the lido said it was "very excited" to have been chosen as a filming location. The lido's main pool was reopened in 2017 after the structure was saved from demolition by a community campaign, leading to the creation of the Saltdean Lido Community Interest Company (CIC). 
Full refurbishment of the lido began in March 2022. The team apologised for any inconvenience caused by the "rare closure". It added that rooms within the lido building besides the pool and cafe would still remain open during the shoot.
