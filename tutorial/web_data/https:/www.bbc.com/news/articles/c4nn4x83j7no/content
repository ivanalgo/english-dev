Nearly 500 bus drivers are planning to strike for two days after rejecting a new pay offer from their employer, Stagecoach.Members of the Unite union on Merseyside will walk out on 24 and 25 June, when Pink is due to appear in concert at Liverpool's Anfield stadium.  A strike planned for this week was called off in what the union called "a goodwill gesture" while members voted on the improved pay offer.Stagecoach has been contacted for a comment.
Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: "Stagecoach can fully afford to offer our members a fair pay increase and it has so far failed to do so."Unite union members previously said they were angry that their salary was £3,000 a year less than drivers at rival company, Arriva.Unite regional officer Brian Troake added: "Stagecoach is a major player in Merseyside buses and it must reflect that in how it pays its drivers, without whom they wouldn't have a bus service. “Our members are unhappy with the current pay offer and will not hesitate to take further strike action if Stagecoach doesn’t make an improved offer.“Stagecoach is set to cause real issues for the Liverpool public if it continues to under-value and under-pay its own staff."
