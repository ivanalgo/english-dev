People in the Philippines have been battling knee-deep floodwater after Typhoon Gaemi lashed the country's capital. Footage shows people attempting to walk through the flooding in Manila, whilst others tried to drive and even swim to their destination. The flooding was so severe that foreign exchange markets, schools and government offices were all closed. Although Gaemi did not make landfall, it is enhancing a south-westerly monsoon which is causing heavy rain across the island nation. The coast guard said just over 350 passengers and 30 vessels had been stranded in ports near the capital, and Manila's airport said airlines had begun to cancel flights.
