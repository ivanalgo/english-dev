MrBeast's YouTube co-host Ava Kris Tyson has quit the channel after grooming allegations, which she denies.The 28-year-old US YouTuber, who has more than 22,000 subscribers on her own channel, was accused of sending inappropriate messages to a minor, reportedly then 13, when she was 20.On X, Ava denied the claims saying, "I never groomed anyone", but apologised for her "past behaviour" in a statement.She said that she and MrBeast - real name Jimmy Donaldson - have "mutually decided itâ€™s best I permanently step away from all things MrBeast and social media to focus on my family and mental health".
Ava rose to fame after appearing alongside MrBeast on his channel, which has more than 300m subscribers, since 2012.In 2022 he became the most subscribed YouTuber on the platform and is known for huge stunts and his philanthropic videos. Ava revealed last year that she was a transgender woman and that she was undergoing gender-affirming therapy while changing her pronouns to she/her.Allegations first surfaced against her last month in videos shared by other YouTubers which accuse her of messaging a minor when she was 20.Ava responded by saying: "To create a narrative that my behaviour extended beyond bad edgy jokes is disgusting and did not happen."In past years, I have learned that my old humour is not acceptable. I cannot change who I was, but I can continue to work on myself."I humbly apologise to anyone I have hurt with my unacceptable social media posts, past actions, and to those who may feel betrayed by how I used to act online."The alleged victim - who was named online -  has come out to defend Ava saying: "These videos are massive lies and twisting the truth. "Ava never did anything wrong and just made a few edgy jokes. I was never exploited or taken advantage of."BBC Newsbeat has contacted representatives for Ava Kris Tyson and MrBeast for comment.
