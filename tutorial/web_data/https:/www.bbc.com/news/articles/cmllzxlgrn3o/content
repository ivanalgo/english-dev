Teachers' unions have dismissed a pay offer from Scottish local authorities which they say falls well below their expectations.Councils offered them a 2% rise in August and a further 1% rise next May.Unions say there is now only a short window of opportunity to reach a deal.Council body Cosla said they were "disappointed" the offer has been rejected, and further industrial action could mean job losses and service cuts.
The pay deal which settled last year's teachers strike meant a rise was due this August.Teachers pay is negotiated by a committee which brings together the teachers' unions, councils as the employers of teachers  and the Scottish government.The unions received the pay offer yesterday from the council body Cosla.
Des Morris, the joint chair of the teachers’ side on the committee said: “The pay offer, made by Cosla to the teachers’ panel of the SNCT (Scottish Negotiating Commitee for Teachers) yesterday, simply does not begin to address the significant decline in the value of Scottish teachers’ pay since 2008."Worse than this, had this offer been accepted, the reality is that teachers’ pay would have been eroded further.”“The unanimous rejection of this unsatisfactory offer, by the SNCT teachers’ panel, sends a clear message to both Cosla and the Scottish government that commitment and effort will be required to ensure that a pay settlement can be agreed by the August 1st implementation date previously agreed by all parties.The SNCT teachers’ panel remains committed to swift negotiations, however, it is imperative that any settlement agreed must mark a step forward in restoring the pay of teachers across Scotland.”A Scottish government spokesperson said it valued the hard work "that our teaching workforce put in for our learners and we remain absolutely committed to ensuring they receive a fair pay deal"."Teacher pay is a matter for the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT) and talks will continue with unions with a view to reaching an agreement which ensures a sustainable deal for all involved," the spokesperson added. 
A Cosla spokesperson said councils remained committed to reaching an outcome that was best for the entire workforce.The spokesperson said Cosla was disappointed the unions had rejected the offer which was in line with the Scottish government’s public sector pay policy.“Whilst we understand our trade unions role in seeking the best deal possible for their members, this year’s local government settlement from Scottish government means that our hands are tied and going any further will mean job losses and service cuts," the spokesperson said. "Councils have no flexibility in terms of teacher numbers, which further restricts any offers that can be made.”
Pay is likely to be a theme at the annual conference of the biggest teachers union the EIS which begins on Thursday.EIS members - along with teachers in other unions - took part in a three-month programme of pay strikes over the winter of 2022-23.The dispute was resolved after the Scottish government gave councils money to finance an improved pay offer.Meanwhile a pay strike by college lecturers in the EIS is continuing.The EIS Further Education Lecturers Association is holding strikes at most colleges this week and over the next three weeks.
