Plans for 120 homes near a lake in Lincolnshire have been approved by a planning committee.The properties would be built on the site of a former quarry off Heron Walk in North Hykeham.North Kesteven District Council members approved the plans on 9 July despite receiving nearly 200 objections.The vote was split, with nine councillors in favour of the plans, four against and no abstentions.
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, an application in 2020 for 150 homes at the site was refused amid concern over the ecological impact. The plans were then amended to reduce the number of dwellings and make 20% of them affordable housing.One of the objectors, Jason Papworth, expressed concern at the apparent incursion into a "green wedge" near existing homes."It will no longer be there if we keep chipping away at it," he said.
Councillor Peter Burley said he had heard "no valid reasons" for refusing planning permission.The site for the new homes was a former sand and gravel quarry before being used for landfill, which ceased in 2015.
