A council has rejected "misleading information" posted online about a row over parking for Radio 1's Big Weekend.Luton Rugby Club had offered "hassle free" parking at its ground for those attending the festival, but later scrapped the plan.The club said it would refund those who had booked a space after it could not satisfy safety concerns raised by Luton Borough Council.The local authority said tickets had been sold to customers "without an agreed and workable solution" as to how customers would get to the event once parked.
It suggested tickets should not have been sold as the One Big Parking offer was "unsanctioned".More than 100,000 music fans are expected to attend Stockwood Park in Luton during the three-day live music event.
Luton Rugby Club had said its ground, located next to the festival site, offered the "safest, closest and easiest" place for visitors to park their vehicles.It said they could have used Lawn Path to access Big Weekend - but this route was closed before tickets went on sale.The club accused the council of having an "unwavering determination" to ensure it could not offer parking in a statement shared online.
However, the council branded the club's words "misleading information" and said the safety of road users and festival-goers had to be prioritised.A spokeswoman for the authority said it had been liaising with One Big Parking about the use of minibuses to transport customers from the club to the venue, but during this consultation the parking offer was cancelled."Luton Council tried to review other options to make the parking provision work, however these all involved additional costs that One Big Parking were not prepared to pay or contribute towards," she added."We understand that this is an incredibly frustrating situation."
