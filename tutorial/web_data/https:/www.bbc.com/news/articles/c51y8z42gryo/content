Singer Billie Eilish is the latest star to read a CBeebies bedtime story, choosing Oliver Jeffers' book This Moose Belongs to Me.The American artist, 22, who recently released her third studio album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, said she "loved" bedtime stories herself when she was a child.Eilish introduces the story by saying that as well as loving music, she also loves nature.She tells the tale of a young boy called Wilfred who says he owns a big moose called Marcel.Speaking about the story, the What Was I Made For singer said: “We need to look after beautiful, wild creatures like Marcel, but we also need to let them do their own thing.”She added: “My favourite thing in the world as a child was a bedtime story and I would be upset if I didn’t get one! I had a lot and I loved them all!”Jeffers said he was "excited" to hear Eilish will read his book later this week.Speaking to BBC Three’s The Catch Up, he said: “This book is about our relationship with nature in some ways and Billie is a champion of that.”He added: “We’re big fans [of Eilish] in our house and so the kids were very excited to see if she’ll read it better than I do”, before going on to suggest that she probably will.Eilish was just 14 when she unveiled her debut single Ocean Eyes. Since then, she has shot to worldwide stardom, scooping up multiple awards along the way.Earlier this year, she and her brother and collaborator Finneas O'Connell won the Oscar for Best Song with What Was I Made For?, which they penned for the Barbie soundtrack.Critics were very upbeat about Eilish's "surprising and intimate" new album, which was released in May.At the time, the star wrote on Instagram that she and her brother had "put so much into this album and have never ever ever loved something more".Other music stars to have read a CBeebies bedtime story include Sir Elton John, Ed Sheeran, Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Gregory Porter, Dave Grohl, Dolly Parton, and Christine and the Queens.Billie Eilish’s story will be broadcast on Friday 19 July on CBeebies and BBC iPlayer.
