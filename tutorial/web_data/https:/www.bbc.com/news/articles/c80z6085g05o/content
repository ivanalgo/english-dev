Plans for a £3m digital centre could get approval from councillors this week.The proposals for Bloxwich, in the West Midlands, were aimed at supporting start-up firms and boosting the public's IT skills, the application said, and would be based inside a former Post Office building.Members of Walsall Council’s planning committee were recommended to approve it on Thursday.The project was part of the Bloxwich Town Deal and had received government funding as part of £25m secured for the town.
Walsall Council purchased the building following the closure of the Post Office last year which had since relocated to Tradeworld on Bloxwich High Street.It was hoped Bloxwich Launchpad, the new digital centre, would be ready in early 2025 after the building was refurbished and extended, a report for the council said.It added the new centre would have one floor designed like a co-working space, which would “support start-ups and small businesses”.The centre would also have one floor with desktop PC’s for members of the public who could use the facilities as informal visitors or as part of training courses at the centre.This news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.
