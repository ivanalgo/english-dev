A chart-topping musician says the Suffolk music scene is “alive, kicking and thriving” with artists “doing great things”.Jesse Quin, who grew up in Framlingham, is a songwriter best known for being the bass player in the alternative-rock band, Keane.When he is not touring the globe with the group, the 42-year-old runs the Old Jet Arts Centre, on the former Bentwaters airbase near Woodbridge.His work at the creative hub sees him meet and help develop up-and-coming local artists who he believes have what it takes to safeguard the future of Suffolk music.
"Suffolk is alive, kicking and thriving and there’s loads of musicians in the area that are doing great things," he said."What I have been really pleased to see is that it doesn’t feel like there is an  egotistical attitude towards building a career in music in the area."
He added: "The people I speak with in Suffolk are all passionate about music - they love it and dedicate a lot of time and energy to really honing their craft and taking it seriously."When I grew up here it was a very different place and I was like ‘get me out of here’ but then I gravitated back and now I love it."
One of the Suffolk bands which has impressed Jesse is Esme Emerson, who will be supporting Keane at O2 Academy Edinburgh on 1 August.He said: "I think they will do a really good job. "It’s not like we are doing them a favour – they are doing us a favour. They will do a great job opening the show."The concert is part of a UK and European tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Keane's debut album, Hopes and Fears."It doesn’t feel nostalgic, it feels more like a marker of progress than an opportunity to look backwards," Quin said."This year has been really interesting because there’s a lot of people coming out to the shows who loved that album when it came out."But there’s been a bit of a moment for [hit single] Somewhere Only We Know on TikTok, so it has driven a whole new generation of people to the gigs."To do this at all is a dream come true, but to be able to maintain it over a 20-year career is extraordinary and it’s not something we take for granted."
