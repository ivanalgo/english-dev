A Lincolnshire council is introducing a free community skip scheme in an attempt to reduce fly-tipping.Boston Borough Council will place skips in the town centre to allow people to dispose of bulky waste.One will be for household items with the other for furniture, in addition a separate collection point will be in place for electrical items.If the trial is successful the project could be extended with skips placed in other locations around the area.
Councillor Callum Butler said: "With this pilot scheme we hope to see it have a positive impact in reducing fly-tipping in this area of Boston."The town centre location has been chosen because of the cases of fly-tipping in this area so we are taking a proactive approach, trying something different and see if that has a positive impact."The skips will be in the St Georges Road Car Park during August and September.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
