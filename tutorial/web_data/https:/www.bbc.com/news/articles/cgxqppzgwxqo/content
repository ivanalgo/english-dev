A town's network of CCTV cameras are "no longer fit for purpose", a report has found.Eastleigh in Hampshire has 51 cameras run by the borough council.But the authority said the system was outdated, with maintenance costs becoming increasingly unaffordable.A public consultation is being held to find an alternative and "more effective" safety initiative.
The camera network offers "limited public protection" at a high cost, according to Eastleigh Borough Council.CCTV is not a service the authority is required to provide.Costing more than £30,000 each year, council leader Keith House said it was difficult to justify at a time when budgets were tight.“As a council we’re committed to promoting the safety and wellbeing of residents, visitors and people who work in the Borough," he said."Levels of crime and antisocial behaviour in Eastleigh are lower than in other comparable town centres and with the council."We’ll be working closely with our police colleagues – and the views of residents, town centre visitors and businesses will be important to helping us develop a more efficient and cost-effective service.”The consultation closes on 18 September.
