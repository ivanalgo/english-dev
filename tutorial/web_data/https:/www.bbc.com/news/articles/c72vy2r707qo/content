Hundreds of people have turned up to see a pub landlord as he retires after 50 years in the trade.Dennis Duckhouse, 66, was in charge of Ye Olde Windmill in Burntwood, Staffordshire, for 26 years.By Saturday afternoon, about 300 people were already enjoying themselves at a party at the pub, but staff told the BBC they were expecting hundreds more as the day went on."He loves everyone, and everyone loves him," said Amy Woodhouse, the pub's general manager.
Mr Duckhouse, who lives in Essington, is well-known in the community thanks to his half-century in the pub business."I got a part-time job collecting glasses before leaving school, and it went from there," he told the BBC.He said he loved the Windmill because it was in the countryside, served good food, and had good customers."It's just been a place to serve the local community," he added."But I've reached the great age of 66, and I may as well enjoy myself a bit more."The party included a band, cake and presents.
As well as being a familiar face, he was known for wearing a waistcoat and bow tie to work."It's my trademark," he said.Ms Woodhouse, 25, who has worked with Mr Duckhouse for eight years, said: "He's pretty much a local celebrity."He's got a brilliant sense of humour. He gives the regulars the banter back, he's my best friend. "Everyone, the whole town for miles and miles, they love him."
