The family of a man who was kicked and stamped on by a police officer at Manchester Airport have been left "traumatised", a solicitor representing them has said.Akhmed Yakoob was speaking on behalf of brothers Muhammad Fahir Amaaz and Amaad Amaaz, who were both involved in the incident.Footage was shared online of a Greater Manchester Police (GMP) firearms officer - who has since been suspended - striking a man twice as he lay prone on the floor.The force said the officer's actions had come after he and other colleagues were "violently attacked" at about 20:30 BST on Tuesday.
GMP said it had happened after officers tried to arrest someone in the airport's Terminal 2 following a fight. A police spokesman said there had been a "clear risk" their weapons could be taken from them, and three officers had been taken to hospital, one with a broken nose.
The force said it understood the “deep concerns" that had been "widely raised".Four men, aged 19, 25, 28 and 31,  were arrested on suspicion of assault and affray and all have since been bailed.The footage sparked a protest outside Rochdale police station on Wednesday night, with hundreds of people gathered and chants of "shame on you" heard before a second protest began in Manchester city centre on Thursday evening.Mr Yakoob said the medical condition of the man who had been kicked, whom he named as Muhammad Fahir Amaaz, had worsened overnight and a CT scan had "revealed there is a cyst on his brain".The solicitor also revealed the brothers were family members of a serving GMP officer.The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) regional director, Catherine Bates, said a "robust investigation" into the circumstances surrounding the incident would take place.She said the IOPC had since received a further referral from GMP in relation to the incident. The first concerned the use of force by an officer on a man who was detained on the ground while the second "related to the same officer’s use of [pepper spray] on another man at the airport".Ms Bates said: "We have met with members of the first man’s family today, some of whom were present during the incident, to explain our role and to listen to their concerns. We will keep them updated as our investigation continues."
Speaking outside Rochdale police station, Mr Yakoob said the incident was an example of "brutality".He continued: "The people who were assaulted by the police are members of a police officer's family."This man is now afraid to go to work. He went in today and spoke to his supervisor, and the only reason he is not going to work is because he is fearing for his own safety and he thinks, like his family members were the victims, he could be a victim."The family are OK but they are traumatised."Mr Yakoob said he had met the IOPC but could not go into detail as it was in the "early stages" of its investigation."For me the main concern is the family receive justice, and this no longer happens again," he said.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he understood the public's concern over the footage and there was now "a process" following the suspension of the officer.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said she shared "the deep concern surrounding the video".It was, she added, "extremely important" the police watchdog was able to begin its investigation "swiftly and conduct it thoroughly".
The second protest began in Manchester city centre on Thursday evening, with a crowd gathering outside Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's offices in Oxford Street before moving on to nearby St Peter's Square.One of the protesters said they felt "shocked" and compelled to come out to be a part of the demonstration, which featured various anti-police sentiments.Some of the city's trams were unable to operate through the city centre because of sections of the crowd encroaching on the tracks, with the Bee Network travel firm apologising to passengers.Mr Burnham earlier told BBC Radio Manchester he had seen "the full footage" that showed a "fast-moving and complicated situation in a challenging location – it’s not clear cut"."Time has been taken to get a clearer picture of what has happened," he said, adding that an investigation needed to proceed now "in a thorough and measured way".He added: "I would ask for calm because what I can assure people is that the right and proper steps have been taken in the right way."
Newly elected Rochdale MP Paul Waugh said he had spoken to the family involved and their priority was "the health and wellbeing of their family members, including their mother".He said: "The family also want me to make it crystal clear that they have no political agenda, do not condone political violence, and do not want to take part in any protests."They wanted me to appeal for calm and I hope that appeal is heeded."And while there is clearly deep concern about this incident, there is also a vital need not to let extremists of any kind hijack these events for their own ends."He added: "This is a hard working Rochdale family, some of whose members are police officers themselves and are therefore particularly shocked at what they have witnessed."The Greater Manchester Police Federation said it "noted" the decision of the force to suspend the officer.A spokesman added: "The matter is now under investigation - everyone has the right to a fair hearing where all sides of the story are told and context is provided."
