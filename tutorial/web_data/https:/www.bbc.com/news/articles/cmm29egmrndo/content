Sussex's fishing industry is set to get a boost with a new processing plant nearing completion.The facility, in Newhaven, East Sussex, has been paid for with a £1m grant from Lewes District Council.The money was part of a central government allocation of £12.68m to improve the town's infrastructure and commercial fishing industry.Council leader Zoe Nicholson said the unit would be "making a real difference to the fishing community".
A community interest company (CIC) was set up to oversee the scheme, with land purchased on an industrial unit on the Oak Estate in New Road.Equipment such as a chiller, freezer, forklift truck, pallet truck, an ice making machine and storage containers were also purchased.A draft lease is now being reviewed.Ms Nicholson said: "Very soon the plant will be in operation, making a real difference to the fishing community, who will be able to land their catch nearby, process the fish and use the freezers for storage."This is really important in retaining the value of the catch in Newhaven, opening up opportunities to wider markets in the future."The CIC will focus on sustainable fish and fishing techniques, and is considering creating its own brand of fish fingers.
