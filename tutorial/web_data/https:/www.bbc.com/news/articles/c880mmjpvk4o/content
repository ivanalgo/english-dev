Rescuers in Kentucky are marvelling at the "miracle" survival of a hiker who was missing for two weeks in a remote complex of canyons in the scenic Red River Gorge.Scott Hern, 46, was located alive by the Wolfe County Search & Rescue Team on what was going to be the last day of their search mission.Officials say they are amazed that he was able to survive, despite having no food for 12 days.In a Facebook post on Monday, rescuer Eric Wolterman described how he and Mr Hern shared an emotional hug on Saturday."It was going to be the final day of searching whether we located anything or not," he wrote in his post.Mr Wolterman's team spent hours bushwhacking, he wrote, calling the treacherous landscape "the roughest terrain you could imagine".He said the team found footprints in the mud and stopped to regroup. They heard a "very faint noise" and after calling out, heard someone say "help".Mr Wolterman described running after Mr Hern told the group his name, writing: "I have never moved faster up hill in my entire life."After telling Mr Hern that he was safe, the lost hiker asked for a hug."I got teary eyed, and gave him a big hug. I think it was the best hug of both of our lives," he wrote.Mr Hern had last been seen on 6 July. Family members said he had planned to explore the region's waterfalls.He was taken by helicopter to hospital after his rescue, and is currently recovering.
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear praised rescuers in a statement, saying their work led to "a remarkable outcome"."Thank you to the Wolfe County Search & Rescue Team and everyone who assisted in rescue efforts," he said.The lush Red River Gorge Geological Area in eastern Kentucky is known for steep cliffs and rock formations that are popular with rock climbers.
