Trains in Sussex, including between Gatwick Airport and Brighton, have been disrupted due to a landslip, according to train operators.Southern Rail said the landslip happened overnight between Hassocks and Burgess Hill.Engineers were on site assessing the landslip and whether it was likely to get worse, according to Network Rail.The company said it was unlikely a full train service would return on Saturday.
Network Rail said: "While some trains are still able to run through the area, we’re sorry for the inconvenience that this is causing Southern and Thameslink customers today."It said engineers were "closely monitoring" both the slip and the track, carefully removing vegetation on the embankment to better understand the cause and determine if it was likely to worsen.A spokesperson for the company said: “While we work on a plan to deal with the landslip we’re working to reinstate the full train service as soon possible."It’s unlikely we’ll be able to run the full train service today [Saturday] but if you’re heading to or from Brighton, please check before you travel and contact train operators for the very latest information."
Limited services were able to run past the landslip using one of the two lines, Southern said, adding that those trains would be delayed.Gatwick Express services between the airport and Brighton have also been suspended and there were diversions in place.Passengers were told they could use their Gatwick Express tickets on Thameslink services at no extra cost.Govia Thameslink Railway, which operates Southern Rail and Gatwick Express, said in a statement: "We would encourage any customer whose journey is delayed to claim for Delay Repay compensation."The Brighton Miles accessible running event was taking place in the city on Saturday, ahead of the Brighton Marathon on Sunday.
