Four men have been charged after police found four cannabis factories and £350,000 worth of illegal drugs inside homes in Doncaster. The arrests came after four addresses were raided by officers in Hexthorpe, Doncaster, at 07:00 BST on Tuesday, South Yorkshire Police said.Four men, aged 18, 26, 35 and 37 were arrested and charged with production of a Class B drug after the discoveries on Spansyke Street, Ellerker Avenue and Stoneclose Crescent in Hexthorpe. Sgt Steve Roberts, from the force, said drugs were being grown "on a mass scale".
"From the outside these houses might look like ordinary, unassuming homes but once we gained entry inside we could see that wasn't the case," he said."Huge, sophisticated cannabis grows were found inside every property we raided."
The force reminded people who have information about the production or supply of drugs in their local area to get in contact.  "Something we are seeing more and more of is the electricity being bypassed in properties where cannabis is being grown on such a big scale," Sgt Roberts continued."This poses a serious fire risk to innocent people in neighbouring properties and it also has the potential to trigger power cuts."Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
