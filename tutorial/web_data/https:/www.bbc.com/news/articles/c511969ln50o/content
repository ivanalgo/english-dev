A film composer who has worked on James Bond movies, Independence Day and Good Omens has said he is proud to come from Luton.David Arnold, who was speaking to BBC Three Counties Radio ahead of Radio 1's Big Weekend visiting the town on Friday, said the Bedfordshire town was undeserving of the criticism it often receives in the press.He said: "You get the occasional piece saying it's the worst place to visit, those horrible things that say it's the worst place to live - it's really not."Luton is a place where hard work has to happen. You come out of Luton having learnt a lot about life and what it's like to be a human being amongst other human beings." 
The 62-year-old, who won a Grammy for his work on the 1996 film Independence Day, recalled how growing up in Luton influenced his career."I started getting my music education at 33 Guildford Street, which is the old arts centre down there which is not there anymore."There was not that many places you could go in the 1980s."While there he met teenager Danny Cannon, who would eventually go on to executive produce and direct the pilot for the TV franchise CSI.The two worked together on the 1993 film The Young Americans, which then lead to a role as a composer on Roland Emmerich's Stargate.He joked: "Being from Luton meant that anyone from Hollywood that was giving me a hard time was going to stand a chance."Growing up and playing in pubs and clubs in and around Luton that you see everything, you see all sorts of people with all sorts of hopes and dreams and disappointments."
The former student of Beechwood School and Challney High School praised teachers he had growing up in the town.He said: "My mum and dad wouldn't of had any concept of how that works... but what I was exposed to through my teachers was an enthusiasm for music."The Sherlock composer added that when he was a student at Luton Sixth Form college he was enthused with a passion of ideas and originality.He recalled: "I remember my first art lesson with Alan Hall at sixth form college, he took what I was painting seriously."It gave some credence to your ideas as an originator and that made all the difference."
