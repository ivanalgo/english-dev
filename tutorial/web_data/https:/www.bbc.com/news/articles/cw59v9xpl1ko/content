Businesses and organisations have said new parking proposals in North Somerset are not needed. North Somerset Council is consulting with residents about how they park locally, which may result in parking charges being introduced in Portishead, Nailsea and Clevedon.The council said charges would encourage people to make more sustainable short journeys and also form a revenue stream as it looks to make savings.However some groups argue that it would put visitors off coming to the area and impact local leisure and business companies.
"It'll just stop people coming out - even on sunny days," said Carolyn Job, a volunteer at Portishead Tennis Club. She said members and volunteers will see the parking charge as another fee on top of the charges they pay to use the courts."There's no consideration of alternatives," she said.She added that parking charges could also disrupt play in the middle of a tennis match - if the allotted time on a ticket runs out.
Emma Pusill, from the Portishead Pool Community Trust who operate the town's lido, said they are very worried about the proposals."We've done a lot of talking to people and we're yet to find a single person who supports the introduction of parking charges," she said.The pool is run primarily by volunteers and staff on the national living wage, who Ms Pusill said will find it more difficult to come to work if they have to pay to park.She added that the steep hills near the pool mean many people have to drive to access the pool rather than cycle or walk. 
The council has been accused by Ms Job of already deciding to introduce the charges and for having a "skewed" consultation which does not allow free comment.But executive member for Highways and Transport at North Somerset Council, Hannah Young, said "this is no way a done deal"."We've had over 4,000 responses so far to the consultation and are looking at all the comments," she added.The council is also proposing a short-stay permit to promote local shopping and benefit business and the economy.It also said that parking charges can help "cover a Â£50m funding gap over the four years".The consultation ends on 7 May and a decision could be made by the council in the summer.
