A wildlife trust responsible for two zoos in Devon and Cornwall has announced redundancies as part of a financial rescue package.The Wild Planet Trust, which runs Paignton Zoo and Newquay Zoo, said it faced "crippling challenges" and action was required to ensure the future of the institutions.Stephen Kings, the trust's interim executive chairman, said cost-cutting measures "inevitably means redundancies". Trustees said there was no immediate threat to the operation of the zoos and animal welfare was a priority.
Mr Kings said fewer people were visiting the zoos due to cost of living pressures. He said the decision had "not been taken lightly" but the trust had "no option but to review our staff and operating costs"."Unfortunately, the combination of Covid-19, avian influenza, and the cost of living crisis has resulted in fewer visitors to our zoos over the past few years," he said."It is often forgotten that we are a charity purely funded by our supporters, members and visitors."Therefore this has forced the trust to cut costs, which inevitably means redundancies."He said the current position of the charity meant it needed to cut costs by "about £1m in a year".
The trust said its financial challenges included the repayment of a government loan taken during the forced closure in the pandemic and ongoing operational costs of £1m per month for both zoos."We started off with a £3m loan from the government during covid, we are now paying that back at approximately £40,000 a month and we have £1.4m to pay off," he said. Mr Kings said the charity needed the public's support "now more than ever"."We have many other improvement plans in place for future developments so therefore need the support of everyone who loves our zoos," he said.The trustees said they were committed to stabilising the operation of the zoos as tourist attractions while also advancing Wild Planet Trust's animal conservation efforts.They said they had informed councils, businesses and tourism leaders of the situation and to explore potential partnerships.
