A final fundraising push is under way to restore a cinema in Devon said to be Agatha Christie's favourite.The Grade II-listed Paignton Picture House, which dates back to 1914, closed in 1999.The Paignton Picture House Trust said about £1.4m was still needed to complete the last phase of the £7m restoration project.It is hoped main restoration and redevelopment work will start in autumn before it reopens in early 2026.
The trust said the cinema on Torbay Road was thought to be the oldest surviving purpose-built picture house in Europe.Christie, the crime novelist from Torquay, was thought to have her favourite seat in the circle.Project director Josephine Brown said it was a "pivotal moment" for the picture house."This is the final push to get the building re-opened," she said.
The trust said the restored cinema would be a net-zero building, while also retaining period features such as its stained glass windows, mosaic floor and distinctive circular front door.A total of £5.6m towards the overall cost of the project has already been secured, much of it in the form of various government grants, the trust said.Ms Brown said the building had a "magic" and a "personality"."Some people say it feels like she gives you a big hug when you walk in," she said.
