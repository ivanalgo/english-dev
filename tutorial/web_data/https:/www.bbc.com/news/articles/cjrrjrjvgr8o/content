Scout volunteers have been told they need to raise £133,000 by the end of the month to save their long-planned community building.The 33rd Norwich Group, based in Jessopp Road, had received a grant of £915,609 from the Youth Investment Fund for a sustainable Scout and Community Hub.Inflation and rising costs mean the cost of the project has increased, despite a 20% contingency being included in the bid for the grant. Andrew Parle, lead volunteer for the group, said the money from the grant would be lost if building work did not start by 1 July.
According to the group, the current site is "falling apart" with holes in the roof, doors hanging off their hinges and mould on the wall.Mr Parle said: "We have really dilapidated old buildings built in the 1950s; no insulation, so we get ice on the windows."
Fundraising for a new building started five years ago and summer fayres, Christmas tree recycling and supermarket bag shopping events have been held to raise funds.About 120 people use the facilities for Scouts but the building is also used by 12 other community groups.
The group said inflation had taken the 20% contingency it set aside. Mr Parle said the total shortfall "has moved me to tears". He added: "Unless we can find this money now we have no choice but to hand the grant back.   "In these difficult times our young people need us more than ever, and our waiting list is growing all the time. We just want to be able to give them the facilities they deserve.”
