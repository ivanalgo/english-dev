A council has said there is "nothing" it can do to stop a controversial housing estate being built on a golf course.More than 2,000 people signed a petition calling on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead to stop a large new housing estate being built on Maidenhead Golf Course.But the council said it was locked into a legal agreement, signed by the previous administration, with Cala Homes to deliver the project.The developer said the plans were "sensitive" and had public green spaces at their "heart".
Campaigner Tina Quadrino presented the petition to councillors on Wednesday and said Cala Homes had "no credible plan" to protect the land."This council needs to demonstrate to the people of Maidenhead and Windsor its commitment to upholding our rights to the fair and proper use of public funds as well as our right to a liveable environment," she said.Liberal Democrat council leaders said they had campaigned against the plans when they were put in place by the former Conservative leadership.
In 2018, the then-Conservative council signed a development agreement with Cala and, in 2022, designated the golf course as a site for housing in its 15-year local plan.Liberal Democrat councillor Adam Bermange, who is responsible for planning, said he had spent "countless hours" trying to find a way out of the agreement but they were "well and truly bound".John Allan, managing director at Cala Homes, said the company had worked closely with local residents to develop its plans and promised a "sensitive, landscape-led development" with large areas of open space."Protecting and enhancing the site's woodland and wildlife is vitally important to us and our proposals retain as many natural aspects of the site as possible," he said."A green spine will run through the development, connecting to a new central park and several play areas."Importantly, this vast green space is designed to support the retention and protection of Rushington Copse â€“ an ancient woodland which is not currently accessible to members of the public - and nearby woodland."He added the plans also included new walking and cycling routes.
