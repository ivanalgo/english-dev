A church minister said people had carried out “mindless violence” after the church hall and several gravestones were smashed.Hertfordshire Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident at St Mary’s Church in Baldock which took place early on Friday morning.Rector Rev Phillipa Maddox said “all the windows and doors” of the church hall had been broken.“It's really such a profound shock because this is a space that’s loved by the community,” she said.
Police believe the vandalism took place between 02:00 and 04:00 BST, and said some nearby vehicles were also damaged.Rev Maddox said "some of the gravestones have been completely destroyed. Even though most of the people in these graves died a long time ago, it’s still part of us.""It's hard to think of something so violent being done in a space that feels so peaceful."She said police had advised them to close the church hall for at least a week, which would have a major impact."The church hall is used every day for the food bank, food pantry, ballet classes every day, toddler groups, party bookings – it's at the heart of the community."
Lay minister Katrina Nice said "a lot of residents came out to see what happened, and were indignant and upset"."A lot of people walk through the churchyard, and they feel a sense of ownership. "The damage is shocking. I don't know whether the gravestones can be mended, as some are really badly smashed.""It's horrible because it's such a part of Baldock," she added.The Ven Janet Mackenzie, Archdeacon of Hertford, said she was "very saddened" by news of "such thoughtless vandalism"."It will doubtless cause distress within the local community. We will work alongside the Rector and people of St Mary’s to help them put this damage right.”
