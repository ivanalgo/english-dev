Listen: MET Medical and Healthwatch Hertfordshire on private ambulancesMET Medical has been used as contractor for the health service and has responded to more than 10,000 emergency calls over the last 10 years.Director Dave Hawkins said: "This isn't an emergency service, this is urgent care."This is for people that need urgent medical attention, so that would be people who might normally see a GP but the appointment is two weeks away, or it's a parent worried about their child and just wants them checked out."
He added the service could also prescribe antibiotics or deal with calls that are a lower priority for the NHS, such as elderly people who have suffered a fall.He hoped the service would "free up more of the 999 service to deal with those emergencies" and reduce waiting times.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: "We are committed to ensuring people get the emergency care they need. Under our urgent care recovery plan, we provided £200m in 2023-24 to expand ambulance capacity and improve response times, and will maintain that additional capacity this year to further improve performance."We have already seen significant improvements in response times - with average Category Two responses in February over 28% faster than the same point in the previous year."
