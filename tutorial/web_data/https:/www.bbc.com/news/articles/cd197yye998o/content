Water supply to hundreds of homes has been disrupted by "third party damage", Thames Water has said. Many residents in Royal Wootton Bassett, Thornhill and surrounding Wiltshire villages of Bradenstoke and Lyneham have had little or no access to running water since Tuesday morning. The water company said the damage was caused in a "complex and rural location", and was repaired yesterday. Customers have been advised that they should now have water supply, though may still experience low pressure.

Water pressure is expected  to improve throughout the day, and Thames Water have reopened their bottled water station at the Tesco on Beaversbrook Lane, Calne. "We will continue to deliver bottled water to customers on our priority services register.
