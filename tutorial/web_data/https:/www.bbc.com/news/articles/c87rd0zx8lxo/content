A crumbling pub that was forced to close down can now be demolished and replaced with flats.The former Waggon and Horses in Smethwick will be demolished to make way for 11 new flats after a planning application was passed by Sandwell Council’s planning committee.The pub was forced to close in August 2021 over fears it was at risk of total collapse.The plans drew criticism from neighbours, however, with 28 objections submitted ahead of the planning meeting – largely over the lack of car parking spaces on-site.
One objector told councillors community sentiment was against the proposal, and called for greater public consultation over the future of the site.The objector also said the proposed flats were out of character for the area and too tall.Councillor Bob Piper said the former pub needed demolishing sooner rather than later.“If we don’t demolish it soon, it will fall down of its own accord,” he told the planning committee at the meeting on Wednesday.
The local authority previously approved an application by Sir Harry's Properties to demolish the building in March 2022 but the work was never carried out.Planning officers said the latest proposals would bring benefits to the area, adding that housing was much-needed there.They said the pub had been an eyesore and been the subject of numerous complaints.Before its forced closure, the pub on the corner of Lewisham Road and Halfords Lane was known as a popular venue for West Bromwich Albion supporters due to it being only a short walk from the club’s home ground.
