A new £300m theme park would showcase British history, without rollercoasters or "neon flashing lights", the company behind the plans has said.Puy du Fou, which has run parks in Les Epesses in France since 1978 and in Toledo, Spain, since 2021, will hold consultations on the plans for Bicester, Oxfordshire, on 18 and 19 July.The company said it was a "world leader in creating spectacular historic shows and immersive experiences".On the continent, it has showcased historical events such as the Roman Empire and figures like patron saint of France, Joan of Arc.
Olivier Strebelle, Puy du Fou's chief executive, said the park, which would be based close to the M40, could employ up to 700 people once open. “We are not an attraction like you have ever experienced before," he said."We do not have any rides or rollercoasters; there are no neon flashing lights. "Instead, we create an authentic, natural and historical environment set within beautiful gardens, which become the setting for world-class shows and immersive cultural and historical experiences for the whole family to enjoy."Consultation events will be held at Bicester's Weyland Hall from 12:00 to 19:00 BST on 18 July and at Wesley Memorial Church in Oxford from 12:00 to 18:00 on 19 July.Mr Strebelle added: “With Britain’s rich history, and with so many British people already visiting us in France and Spain, we have been looking for a site in the country for many years, and we have now identified the perfect location.“We are still at the early stages of preparing our proposals but look forward to meeting local residents and businesses as part of our public consultation.”
