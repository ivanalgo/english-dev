A student who became homeless while struggling with his identity as a trans man said it was "incredible" to be invited to a garden party at Buckingham Palace.Charlie Murray-Edwards, from Guernsey, had been left sofa-surfing aged 16 after he found it difficult to live at home.The University of Essex student was asked to attend the palace by the charity, Action for Children.He said the royal occasion left him with an "overwhelming sense of accomplishment and pride".
The first-year events management student was assisted by the charity's night-stop service in Guernsey when he first turned to help.He spent time in foster care and went on to begin his studies at the university's Edge Hotel School.
“The garden party at the palace was an incredible moment, and to also be one of the youngest in attendance was a great honour," he said.“Seeing the difference I can make through events reassures me that my adverse childhood wasn't wasted and that it isn't a defining factor of my character."The student explained that when he was first made homeless, he did not think he would even complete his A Levels.Asked what the most memorable thing about his trip to the palace was, he said, "that the royal band played nearly the entire Abba discography". "I had no idea His Majesty was such a fan," he said.
