Plans have been submitted to turn a historic landmark mill into a multi-million pound home, café, shop and museum. Frederick Jacobs submitted the proposal to Cotswold District Council to renovate the Grade II-listed Old Mill on Mill Lane, Lower Slaughter, Gloucestershire.The application includes the conversion of an annex building and the erection of a single storey extension.The council approved a separate application submitted by Mr Jacobs on 26 June, allowing him to set up a "temporary" converted horse trailer outside the property to sell food and drink.
Mr Jacobs said they bought the property about a year ago with the intention of making it their primary home.Originally from Switzerland, he said he has been living in the UK for 12 years but really "fell in love with the village" upon their first visit to Lower Slaughter five years ago.“We are really fortunate to be the custodians of that building,” he said. He added that the Old Mill needs maintenance work to make it suitable for a family of five and ensure its heritage value is preserved.
In the mean time, Mr Jacobs has been allowed to position a converted horse trailer at the Old Mill to provide hot and cold beverages, ice cream, packed snacks, and sandwiches for 12 months.“The trailer is not really a money making exercise for us,” he said.“It’s really to ensure the visitors and residents in the village have somewhere to come consume coffee and act as a meeting point for people."Mr Jacobs said if their application is approved, they will work collaboratively with the parish council and neighbours to ensure the village’s pristine condition is preserved.
Craig Baylis, Mr Jacobs' agent, told the committee he lives in Bibury and is "well aware" of issues residents in tourism hotpot villages face."Mr Jacobs will be investing nearly £4m in acquiring and renovating the property to turn it into something attractive for the community and tourists,” he said.Mr Baylis explained the Old Mill was used as a cafe and souvenir shop by the previous occupiers until Mr Jacobs acquired it. “Once [the mill] does reopen the truck will go, this is only a temporary measure for Mr Jacobs until the renovation is completed," said Mr Baylis."Then we revert back to what it always was, which was a very successful cafe and souvenir shop."He added that the thinking behind the application is to publicise the Old Mill’s renovation.
