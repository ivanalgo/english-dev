New rules are being rolled out at Bristol Airport's security gates.From 14 June, passengers will be able to carry 330ml containers through security - an increase from the previous 100ml rule.Travellers will also be able to leave liquids, laptops and electronics inside their baggage when they walk through security. Chief operating officer, Graeme Gamble, said the new "state-of-the-art technology will reduce customer stress and inconvenience".
Bristol Airport has invested more than £11.5m on the security equipment following the government updating travel rules. Ministers set a summer deadline for airports to install the new technology.
"The need for 100ml liquids to be placed in clear, plastic bags and removed from hand baggage will no longer be required," Mr Gamble added."The new process delivers a much more customer friendly security operation using the latest technology and providing enhanced screening, allowing customers to keep personal items in their hand luggage."Baggage rules vary between airlines so passengers have been urged to check before  travelling, an airport spokesperson said. The rule which meant all liquid over 100ml had to scanned separately was introduced in 2006 as “a temporary measure” after a terrorist plot was uncovered.Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.
