A library in North Yorkshire is helping grow more than just imaginations, having launched a new community seed hub.Voluntary group Grow is leading the venture at Scarborough Library, encouraging visitors to pick up free seeds when they come in to borrow books.The aim is to help residents grow their own food, flowers and herbs with the help of other library resources and a free online app.Darren Mancrief, founder and co-chairman of Grow, which runs a community garden in the town, said the bank would help bring people together and "create resilience through food security".
Mr Mancrief said: "The seed hub will allow locals to get hold of free vegetable, herb, and flower seeds to take home, grow and enjoy."They can also donate seeds to the hub, which is integral to its success.“We think the hub will be a real asset to our community."There will be resources in the hub for growing and seed saving, as well as an extensive collection of books and information in the main library and online.North Yorkshire Council’s executive member for libraries, Councillor Simon Myers, said: “The hub will be a huge asset to the community."Growing your own food can save you money, reduce waste and support local wildlife."Councillor Liz Colling, who represents the Falsgrave and Stepney division on North Yorkshire Council, provided £300 of her locality budget to Grow Scarborough. She said: “The hub is all about sharing what we have with those in our community."As a keen vegetable grower, I shall be making use of the seeds available and donating others."I would urge everyone in the area to get involved and support this worthwhile venture."Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
