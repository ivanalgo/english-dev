A drug which it is hoped could help people living with one of the most common types of alopecia has been given approval for use in the NHS in Scotland.Ritlecitinib, provided under the brand name Litfulo, had previously been approved in England.It is for treating severe alopecia areata in people who are aged 12 and over.Last month Megan McCready, who supports young people going through diagnosis, told the BBC it would be a "big step forward" if the drug were approved.
"I would definitely take up the opportunity of taking the drug and trying it out," she said.Although the daily pill will not cure the hair-loss condition, it could provide treatment to some who suffer severe effects.
Litfulo is one of seven new medicines approved by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) for use by NHS Scotland.Other treatments include drugs for a heart condition, cancer and insomnia.The support group Alopecia UK welcomed the announcement to give Litfulo the all-clear.Chief executive officer Sue Schilling said: "Alopecia UK has been inundated with inquiries from people right across the UK, including many in Scotland, wanting to understand more about this new medicine."We hope that Litfulo will be a treatment option for many patients with severe alopecia areata across the whole of the UK."Unfortunately, in reality, we are still unsure what will happen for patients wishing to access this treatment via the NHS."We know that dermatology referral pathways continue to be challenging for many patients."
