Fictional Norwich-based DJ Alan Partridge, portrayed by Steve Coogan, has been spotted filming in the city for a new BBC series.The six-parter - And Did Those Feet... with Alan Partridge - to be shown on BBC One and BBC iPlayer, will follow the broadcaster as he settles back into life in Norfolk after a year working in Saudi Arabia.Among many of the character's well-known phrases is "smell my cheese" - a desperate attempt to impress a fictional BBC editor - and Coogan was filming on Friday at a well-known city cheese stall.Paula Taylor, who has run The Cheeseman at Norwich Market for 24 years, said Coogan visited "about eight or nine years ago, but it was lovely to see him come back to smell my cheeses - he's such a nice man."
Coogan's Bafta award-winning character, born in King's Lynn, Norfolk, made his debut appearance in 1991 as a sports presenter on BBC Radio 4's On the Hour.He moved on to television with programmes including The Day Today, Knowing Me Knowing You and I'm Alan Partridge.
Coogan and his alter-ego have been spotted at a number of Norwich venues recently and Ms Taylor said it was delightful to have him back at her cheese stall during Friday's filming.She had to close her market stall until 10:30 BST, but said: "He was so friendly and it was a pleasure to do so."The film crew were lovely and all our customers were so understanding."Although Ms Taylor said she was too far away to hear much of the dialogue, she said: "I think this is like his come-back and yes, he did want to smell my cheese."Has it made me famous? Well, everyone has their moment," she added.
