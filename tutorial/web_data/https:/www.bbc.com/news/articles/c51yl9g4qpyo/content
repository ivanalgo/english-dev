Guernsey's building firms have been left "in the soup" after plans for a temporary scrap pile for construction waste were rejected, a deputy has said.Deputy Peter Roffey, Employment and Social Security President, said the decision not to store the material at Longue Hougue had "banjaxed" the construction industry.The proposal was rejected at a planning meeting on Monday after politicians highlighted concerns over the time period for stockpiling and the design's sustainability.Mr Roffey said it was an "extraordinary decision" and he had no choice other than to appeal it.
"I'm really very angry and vexed that we're in this situation," he said."As a result we're completely in the soup."Literally within a few weeks there will be nowhere to put our inert waste and what's that going to do to the construction industry?"
In 2023 the States raised concerns over the capacity at Longue Hougue.One solution was to create the temporary stockpile which would have been used for three years while another permanent site was chosen. Mr Roffey said there was nowhere else in Guernsey licensed to dispose of inert waste."We could conceivably export it elsewhere but that would add massively to the costs of construction on the island, which is already more expensive than just about anywhere else," he said. Deputy Victoria Oliver, President of the Development and Planning Authority, said she believed it was still "possible" for a solution to be found despite the plans being rejected.
