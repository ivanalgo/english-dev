A 15-year-old who was diagnosed with a serious heart condition at the age of 10 is undertaking a fundraising walk to help pay for a defibrillator for his local boxing club.Erin, who lives near Whitchurch, Shropshire, will walk the Long Mynd and Carding Mill Valley on 17 August.His mum Michelle said he needed close monitoring and his condition meant he was at risk of having a sudden heart attack.She said his boxing club did not currently have a defibrillator, due to cost, but Erin hoped his fundraising would mean the lifesaving kit was soon available for members.
“Despite living with a serious heart condition and other debilitating medical conditions, [Erin] continues to inspire us every day with his courage, determination and unwavering spirit,” his mum said.Erin, who carries a personal defibrillator with him, was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy which places significant limitations on the types of physical activity he can do.Michelle said his love for boxing had remained a constant source of joy and motivation for him, and Fort Boxing Club had been like a sanctuary.“Although Erin could never compete, the boxing club have accepted his limitations and he joins in to the best of his abilities and medical needs,” she said.“Given his condition, the safety measures at the boxing club are of paramount importance to us,” she added.“One of the critical pieces of equipment that could save lives, including my son's, is a defibrillator.”
Erin’s goal is to raise £1,500 to ensure the club is equipped with the device.Of coping with his condition, he said: “I just deal with it.“I just think on the positive side, of stuff that’s going to come."Erin said he would take his time with the walk, so as not to put too much stress on his body.“I think it can prove something to people with the same condition as me,” he said.“You can still do stuff like that,” he explained.The trail covers a distance of almost six miles across varied terrain.Michelle said the walk had been discussed with a cardiologist looking after Erin, and they had considered the risks involved.His boxing and the walk were both ways of helping him gain some independence, she said.
