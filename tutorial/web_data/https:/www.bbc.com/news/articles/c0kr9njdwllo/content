A probation unit has been ordered to improve following its first inspection by a watchdog.Essex South Probation Delivery Unit (PDU) has experienced staff shortages and high workloads, and inspectors raised concerns over the way people who might pose risks to others were managed.The HM Inspectorate of Probation spent a fortnight in April and May reviewing the unit, which was set up in 2021 after different organisations merged. Martin Jones, the chief inspector of probation, praised the service for its partnerships and leadership, but said the "quality of work delivered to manage people on probation was insufficient in three out of four of our standards of casework".
He continued: "[The] unit has much to be proud of, but given its long history of recruitment difficulty, we consider the current recruitment model operated nationally by the probation service is unlikely... to address its resourcing issues - a more localised incentive-based approach may be required. "If improvements to staffing can be addressed and there is a focus on the quality of casework, the PDU can continue to progress on a very positive trajectory."Probation officers supervise people serving community and prison sentences - which can include helping them find accommodation and employment - and monitor their risk to the community.The service in Essex operates from two main offices in Southend-on-Sea and Laindon, as well as a reporting centre in Thurrock. It also works from courts in Basildon and Southend.It is one of eight such units in the East of England, with Southend having the second highest rate of reoffending in the region. 
The inspection noted the unit's proximity to London - where employees benefitted from an extra payment - as well as its high workload, had meant that recruiting and retaining staff was a challenge.The service had just 45% of the required number of probation officers, which was "understandably hampering" the quality of work.Inspectors found in relation to implementation and delivery of casework, only 23% of cases inspected were "judged to effectively support the safety of other people".They also found "inconsistency" in staff understanding priorities, with some viewing public protection as most important, while "others felt meeting performance targets carried more weight than completing work of a high quality".However, the leadership was judged to be "innovative and responsive" and inspectors praised its "impressive" partnership services to help those in need, including those who had been domestically abused.The watchdog also said its services for women - and a multi-agency approach to discuss complex female cases -  benefitted people on probation.Five recommendations have been made including to ensure domestic abuse and child safeguarding information is properly analysed to help assess those on probation and to improve the quality of work in assessing, planning, managing and reviewing the risk of harm to people.PDUs replaced both community rehabilitation companies and the National Probation Service in June 2021.
The Ministry of Justice said, in a statement: “The prison system is in crisis which is putting significant pressure on the whole justice system.“We are gripping the situation and supporting our hardworking staff by improving training and recruiting 1,000 more probation officers nationally to deliver robust supervision and protect the public.”
