A main road through Grantham will be "fully rebuilt" at a cost of £3m, Lincolnshire County Council said.Parts of Dysart Road "are in a dire state", Councillor Richard Davies, the authority's executive member for highways, said."The team will be reconstructing Dysart Road from the ground up. This means excavating and rebuilding the entire road in sections," he added.Roadworks will start on 29 July and involve a full closure of the westbound carriageway for five months.
Mr Davies said: "In total, we expect to use nearly 8,000 tonnes of material during the works.“While the road is dug up, we’ll also be taking the opportunity to replace footways, kerbs and some of the drainage, while also tweaking the road’s dropped kerb arrangements.”
The westbound closure will be in force between the A1 overbridge and the junction with Sankt Augustin Way. A diversion will be in place via Trent Road, Swingbridge Road and Harlaxton Road.Mr Davies said this was necessary for the safety of contractors and disruption was  "a necessary evil" due to the scale of the project.Some overnight full closures of the road will be required towards the end of the project, with dates and further details to be confirmed.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
