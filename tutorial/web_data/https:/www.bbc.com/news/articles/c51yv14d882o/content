Hundreds of pupils will benefit from a safer route to school following roadworks during the summer holidays. Darlington Borough Council is about to begin work to create a better pedestrian route to Hurworth School.Improvements to the route will include the installation of a puffin crossing and the introduction of a 20mph zone outside of the school.To allow for the work to be carried out, Croft Road will be closed to traffic between the entrance to Rockcliffe Court and Elmfield Road from 12 August to 30 August.
A council spokesman said the closure was necessary to ensure the work could be completed safely during the summer holidays."Pedestrian access will be maintained and signed diversions will be in place for vehicles," he added.Changes will also include no waiting and loading restrictions close to the school and three raised crossing facilities created at points along Croft Road.The work will begin on 24 July and will last six weeks.Traffic signals will also be in place to allow vehicles to get between Hurworth Place and Hurworth-on-Tees during the first three weeks.
