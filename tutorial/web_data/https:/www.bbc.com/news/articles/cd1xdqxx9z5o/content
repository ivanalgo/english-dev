Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds has donated gym equipment used during the production of Deadpool & Wolverine to a Welsh charity.The proceeds raised from the auction of several items - including Deadpool-themed weights benches, pulling machines and weights sets - will be given to Your Space.“Not all heroes lift weights, but they sure can pump iron for a good cause,” Reynolds, who plays Deadpool, told the auction host Charitybuzz.“We're auctioning off the very gym equipment that had me begging for mercy while training for Deadpool & Wolverine," he added."This gear isn't just drenched in my sweat—I've also marked my territory by signing these pain machines.”
Your Space is a Wrexham-based charity that provides support to children with autism and their families across Wrexham, Flintshire, Denbighshire, Shropshire and Powys.Wrexham AFC striker Paul Mullin became the patron of the charity after his son was diagnosed with autism in 2023.“Now that I can finally deflate my muscles, all proceeds will go to the phenomenally fit footballer Paul Mullin's Your Space charity,” said Reynolds.Some of the items listed have already attracted bids of more than $2,000 (£1,554).A spokesperson for Your Space said they were "so excited and grateful". 
Reynolds is the co-owner of Wrexham AFC, having bought the club alongside fellow Hollywood star Rob McElhenny in 2020.Since then the team has been promoted to League One - the club's first back-to-back promotion in its 159-year history.Deadpool & Wolverine, which Reynolds stars in alongside Hugh Jackman, opened in cinemas worldwide on Thursday.It follows Reynolds' Deadpool and Jackman's Wolverine as they team up to fight a common enemy.
