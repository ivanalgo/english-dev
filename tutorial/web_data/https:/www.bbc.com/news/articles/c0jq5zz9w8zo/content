Controversial plans to build 126 homes in a village near the M5 have been given the go-ahead.Tewkesbury Borough Council approved an application by Harper Crewe Ltd and John and Rosemary Pugh to develop about 16 acres of land off Stoke Road in Stoke Orchard.The development will see the demolition of existing residential property, Roseleigh, along with its outbuildings and the agricultural building to the north of Banady Lane.A planning committee meeting on Tuesday heard that 24 people objected and raised concerns over increased traffic, but officers said the development's benefits outweigh the harms.
The new estate will be mostly composed of two storey homes and some bungalows.Public open spaces will be arranged around the edges of the site, and will include an orchard area, a play area, and a large balancing pond.A footpath weaving around the site's perimeter will connect the areas of public space for pedestrians and cyclists.
A mix of 75 units of open market housing and 51 affordable homes will feature in the development.During the course of the application, the amount of homes was reduced from 136 to 126, with amendments made to the site layout and access arrangements on officer advise and in response to comments received from the parish council.In addition to traffic concerns and the impact on highway safety, concerned residents said the development would lead to a loss of village character as it is disproportionate to the size of the village and "adds little social value".
They added bus stops should be funded, and warned of the dangers of the T-junction at Banady Lane.The committee voted to grant delegated permission subject to conditions and a section 106 agreement, which includes requests from the highways authority for £339,142.40 for home to school transport, £150,000 for public transport, £50,364 for a travel plan and a £15,000 for a traffic regulation order for speed limit relocation.
