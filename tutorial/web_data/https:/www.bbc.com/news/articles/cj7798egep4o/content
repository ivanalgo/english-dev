A final decision on the closure of a sheltered housing block is to be made.Woking Borough Council has said the site at Brockhill will be too expensive to bring up to standard.In February councillors voted to close it and move residents to alternative accommodation.That decision will be reviewed by the authority's executive later.
Urgent work to meet fire safety regulations and to upgrade the heating would cost £2.75m, the council says.Over the course of the next 10 years the council estimates it will cost over £5.8m to maintain the building, an amount it described in a statement as "unviable and disproportionate for a building that no longer meets modern standards".The report recommends the site be closed by September 2024, with the buildings demolished and the land sold.
The income will be used on new council homes.Louise Strongitharm, strategic director for communities, said: “We have successfully supported many Brockhill residents to move to suitable alternative accommodation locally, based on their needs and preferences, since the decision to close.“We understand that this is a distressing time for remaining residents, who want clarity around future plans. "We are also aware how lonely and isolating Brockhill is becoming for our last remaining residents, so it is in their best interests that we rehome these residents as soon as possible.”
