Trans Pride is set to come to Hastings, East Sussex. The "Big Queer Party" will kick off at The Observer Building, Cambridge Road, on Saturday from 19:00 BST until late, involving songs, cabaret, interactive performances and "dancefloor shenanigans", the organisers said. Trans Pride Hastings will continue on Sunday at Hastings Museum. "On the day, enjoy swim sessions, a queer market, trans history hunt, big dog energy, Queer Ass Folk Stage, food stalls and picnic area, demos and tasters, workshops and more," organisers at Trans Pride Hastings said. 
"This is a party for all queer folk and allies to show love and support for our trans community,” they added.  Trans Pride Hastings was founded in February 2023 and the following July a team of volunteers delivered 15 events across eight days focusing on community building, support and celebration.
