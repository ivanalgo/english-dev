Kyle Clifford, 26, from Enfield, north London, was arrested on 11 July on suspicion of three counts of murder.Hertfordshire Constabulary confirmed that he remained injured in hospital and had yet to be questioned.
Mr Chapman said Mr Hunt had told him that he was "very thankful that people are thinking about them and they are very conscious that they want everyone to know they will be OK".He added that Mr Hunt really appreciated everything that was being done, and told him that "every message that's been sent, every one of those message feels like a hug". "As far as what's happened, it's still beyond belief that this could happen to anyone, a family in the world," Mr Chapman said. "The message from all of us is when you need us [John], we are here."
Mr Chapman said reaching the fundraising target of more than £100,000 "shows from the horror of this event, we have seen the other side of human nature - it just reminds us there's goodness out there in the world".In a previous statement, Mr Hunt and Amy said their devastation "cannot be put into words".“We would like to thank people for their kind messages and for the support we have received in recent days," they added."These have provided great comfort to us for which we are very grateful."
