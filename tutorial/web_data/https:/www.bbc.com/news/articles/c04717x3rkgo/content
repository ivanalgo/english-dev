A series of handmade quilts, documenting different families' Windrush memories, have been put on display.The pieces are the result of 10 workshops held earlier in the year in Ipswich and they are being exhibited at the Hold.Ivya Scott, from Ipswich Windrush Select Committee, was one of those who took part.She said: "People were talking and sharing stories about their mothers who did sewing and knitting. Some of us total beginners like myself."
The sessions were led by experienced artist and teacher, Margaret Holder.Ms Scott said: "We took time, we laughed, we shared food. These were local people, some of them have never made a quilt."We had a third generation person whose grandad came in the 1920s. She left England and went to Barbados to find his relatives."Her story is absolutely amazing."
Emily Shepperson, exhibition and interpretation officer at the Hold, said it was a wonderful project.She said: "This is the first time they have done something that is particularly focusing on quilt making as a really wonderful and creative way of sharing some of those stories from. "There's one which has re-used a family member's wedding dress that captures their personal experience and the ongoing story of the generations and their children and their children's children."A lot of these are extremely personal and emotive."It's about sharing those stories in different ways, but also make sure they're available for future generations as well."
