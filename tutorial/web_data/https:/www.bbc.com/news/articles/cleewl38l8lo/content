Four out of five new-born hedgehogs rescued after being abandoned by their mother have died, an animal charity has said.A Peterborough hedgehog sanctuary said last week that the hoglets had been taken in after their mother did not return to them.The Peterborough Hedgehog Hotel said the biggest weighed about as much as two sachets of tomato ketchup - the smallest less than a sachet-and-a-half.One of the five is still alive but was "not doing great", the sanctuary said in a social media post.
Shelley Brennan, 36, and her partner Nick Penniall, 38, set up the Peterborough Hedgehog Hotel about four years.They said their most recent intake included the five hoglets  - which weighed between 14 and 21g (0.5 to 0.75oz).Mr Penniall said he and his partner would care for the hoglets, which needed feeding every two hours, in shifts.
But the hotel later posted "sad news" on its Facebook page."We're down to one tiny hoglet left out of the five, and she's not doing great," said the post. "There's a very minimal chance of successfully handing rearing day-old hoglets, mums are always the best option but when they abandon nests we'll try everything to keep them going. "Sometimes mums abandon nests or singular hoglets for a reason."We've chucked everything at this litter sadly to no avail."
