A challenge to encourage children to keep up their reading during the summer holidays has been re-launched at a library in the Isle of Man's capital.The Summer Reading Challenge aims to combat a "dip" in learning during the school break for children between the ages of four and 11.Organised by UK charities the Reading Agency and Create, the initiative has been rolled out at Henry Bloom Noble Library in Douglas.Librarian Jan Macartney said it offered a chance to "delve into the wonderful world of books and discover new stories, characters and facts".
The challenge, which was first run at the Douglas library in 2006, allows children to set reading goals involving any books they enjoy and collect rewards for completing the texts over the six-week holiday period.
Ms Macartney said the team at the library would "be on hand to help inspire children and young people with all kinds of imaginative and creative activities" throughout the period.The Reading Agency said the 2024 theme of Marvellous Makers was designed to "fire up children’s imaginations and unleash storytelling and creativity through the power of reading".The charity said more than 630,000 children took part through local library services across the British Isles the previous year.As well as the reading challenge, which is free to take part in, there will also be games sessions, a treasure hunt and crafts to take part in.The library is also playing host to four ticketed workshops during the summer break, which can be booked in advance.
