Voluntary and community groups in Woking have received a final call to let the council know if they want to take on the running of community assets.The borough council, which effectively declared itself bankrupt in June 2023, is handing over the running of community centres and sports pavilions as it attempts to make savings.Four community centres were being prioritised for transfer while the running of sports pavilions and toilets would be transferred later, the council said.Council leader Ann-Marie Barker said it was a "very exciting opportunity" for local organisations to serve their community as she called for more expressions of interest.
She added: "We want to know what your vision is for the asset and what you will offer residents."This is also a positive step for residents as the assets now have the chance to be independently managed and retained for community use."Interested groups have until 31 July to express their interest.The community centres available for transfer include St Mary's in Byfleet, Moorcroft in Westfield and Parkview in Sheerwater.Sports pavilions available include Brookwood Country Park, Brookwood Farm and Woking Park.The council closed all public toilets, except those in Woking town centre's shopping centre facilities.
