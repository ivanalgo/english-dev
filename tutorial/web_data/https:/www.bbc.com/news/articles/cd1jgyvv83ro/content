Residents of a Surrey town have welcomed action to tackle anti-social behaviour.It comes after Surry Police launched a pilot scheme, Safer Redhill, to deal with the community's concerns and slash the number of cases of shoplifting.Some members of the community, who spoke to the BBC on the streets of Redhill, said they were wary of being out in the evening.Victoria, a keen runner, said: "I would never run on my own at certain times, I would always run with a group."
In May, Surrey Police said they had arrested 56 people over the previous two months for offences including drugs, drink driving, assault, shoplifting, going equipped for burglary and immigration offences.Resident Amanda said: "Groups that gang together when you walk around, if they are abusive or intimidate you, that makes you fearful and you tend to stay away from it."John Aitchison, another Redhill resident, said: "It often gets bandied about as being teens but I think it’s people of all ages acting anti-socially now and again."He said he isn’t put off going out in Redhill in the evening “but I can understand why other people could be".
Earlier this year, police surveyed residents and visitors to Redhill about their concerns around anti-social behaviour, drugs, shoplifting and violent crime.Surrey Police, Reigate & Banstead Borough Council, the Police and Crime Commissioner and YMCA East Surrey then announced they had joined forces with local partners to address crime and anti-social behaviour in Redhill.Police said: "The Safer Redhill project has brought police, partners and the community together to combat crime and anti-social behaviour in the town centre following concerns from the community."Safer Redhill is supported by funding secured through the office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, including £265k of Safer Streets funding and £58k from the Community Safety Fund, police reported.Insp Jon Vale, the Reigate and Banstead borough commander, said: "This initiative is about reducing crime in Redhill for the long-term."
