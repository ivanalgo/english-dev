A beauty spot is set to have a number of renovations and safety improvements that could see it reopen next summer.The Old Town Quarry in Weston-super-Mare had to close down in August 2023 after surveys found structural issues with some of the buildings that posed a risk to public safety.Weston-super-Mare Town Council has now signed a lease agreement with North Somerset Council, the site’s owner, and is planning to spend almost £900,000 on the refurbishment.Councillor Mike Solomon, North Somerset Council's executive member for culture and leisure, called the lease “a pivotal moment in the site’s history”.
He added: “Part of an agreed vision and investment package, this allows this much-loved cultural gem to remain in public ownership, enabling local communities to continue to shape its future.”The town council has been awarded a grant of almost £700,000 from the government’s Community Ownership Fund, with an additional £200,000 coming from the council itself.
The town council's plans will build upon previous work carried out by North Somerset Council which included demolishing the quarry stone crushing plant and felling diseased trees.To ensure wildlife protection during the renovations, the town council has commissioned experts to further conduct assessments of trees, bats and birds as well as the site’s buildings.The lease's boundaries exclude the quarry rock face whose responsibility will remain with North Somerset Council and which is planned to be kept in its natural state.Mayor of Weston-super-Mare, John Crockford-Hawley, said the town council’s takeover of the Old Town Quarry “will ensure continuity of purpose with community involvement and much improved facilities”.The town council has been running engagement sessions since May which give local communities the opportunity to bring their ideas for the Old Town Quarry forward.Mr Solomon said he is looking forward to “following the progress of the town council’s work to ensure the quarry’s long-term future, and indeed seeing it reopen again”.Refurbishment works, including the revamp of both main buildings, are set to start in early autumn.
