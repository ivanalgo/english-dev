Only a fraction of tool theft reports in Surrey lead to someone being arrested or charged, new data shows. The data from Surrey Police showed the force received 277 tool thefts reports between April 2023 and March 2024, but only two charges and five arrests were made.Former Camberley tree surgeon Charlie Westcott estimates about £40,000 worth of tools had been stolen from him across three thefts, which played a part in him moving away.Det Insp James Ansell said: “We appreciate that this data might cause some alarm when considering the amount of crimes reported, versus the number of charges and arrests made. Be assured we will always exhaust positive lines of enquiry to identify offenders."
Mr Westcott was a victim of tool theft twice in the area, and once just over the county border in Blackwater, Hampshire.He praised Surrey Police's actions following the first theft, but said its other response left him "frustrated". In regards to the second incident, which happened at a compound in Camberley, Mr Westcott said: "Disappointment would be an understatement."I was completely just frustrated and at a loss, because if the police can't do anything, then who can? And I think the people who are doing this know that it will rarely get investigated."
Mr Ansell has urged residents to register their tools online to make it easier for them to be returned.“Unfortunately, in most cases we see, the tools are unidentifiable. Even if we do find them, it is challenging to prove that they have been stolen to then prove theft, and then we cannot return them to their rightful owners."
