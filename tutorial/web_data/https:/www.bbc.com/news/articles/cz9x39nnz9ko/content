A Caribbean festival has brought vibrant colour and the sound of drums to the streets of Coventry.The two-day Coventry Caribbean Reggae event kicked off with a parade and events in the city centre, before the procession moved to War Memorial Park.Steel pans and gospel singers entertained shoppers in Broadgate, with face painting  for youngsters in the West Orchards shopping centre."What a great way to start," Coventry City Council posted on X, adding that it was "a fabulous parade."
The relaunched festival was awarded Â£250,000 in Commonwealth Games legacy funding earlier this year.DJ Mikey Dee said artists for performances in War Memorial Park had been chosen to appeal to audiences young and old"We tried to mix it so we had a blend of artists from back in the day and more up to the times," he said.Organiser Colin Bell said there was also a sound system area at the park and a stage orientated to younger audiences.A ticket-only after party will be held at Coventry's Caribbean centre on Spon Street from 22:00 BST.
Volunteer crew member Naimh Lawrence said: "This is my family, this is what they've celebrated and what they talk about, the stories that I've heard."So it's nice to put that into a picture and into perspective," she said. "It's very bright and colourful and I absolutely love it."Exhibitions will also look at the history of the Windrush generation in the city, including the establishment of supplementary schools.
