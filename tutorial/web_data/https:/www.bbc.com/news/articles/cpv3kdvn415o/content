A proposal is being considered to spend more than £800,000 refurbishing play areas in West Sussex.Chichester District Council is expected to approve the launch of a consultation into the plans for the six play areas in Sherborne Road, Whyke Oval, the Amphitheatre, Priory Park, Florence Park and Oaklands Park.As well as approving the consultation, which is expected to run into August, the cabinet will recommend to full council that a total of £814,000 be spent on the upgrade project.The work to refurbish, replace or improve the play areas should take a year to complete. 
The idea was first raised in January and the council has expressed an interest in contributing money to the project, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service.A report to the cabinet said some of the play equipment has reached the point when it needs to be replaced.The report said: “Some of our play areas are heavily worn and require complete replacement, some offer good equipment that would benefit from modest refurbishment and others can be enhanced with the introduction of inclusive play equipment, items that can be used by disabled children or those with health conditions and impairments."
