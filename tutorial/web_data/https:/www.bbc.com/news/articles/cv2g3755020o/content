A new train station is due to open in Bristol next month, while two others have been hit by fresh delaysNorth Filton station - planned to open in 2026 - has been set back due to YTL Developments increasing the proposed arena's capacity.And Henbury is now scheduled to open in 2027 rather than 2026. Councillor Mark Weston, who represents Henbury, said: "The holy grail gives immortality, and I might need that to get my station.”Meanwhile, residents living in north Bristol could be able to use Ashley Down station from the end August.
Henbury was due to open in 2021 but has not had planning permission yet, and there are concerns about a ramp accessing the site, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).The North Filton station will serve the new Brabazon Arena and housing estate, and Henbury will be the last stop along the newly re-opened line.North Filton station will need to be redesigned because of YTL Developments plans, despite planning permission already being granted.
Speaking about the Henbury delay at a West of England Combined Authority meeting on 22 July, Mr Weston said: “It was 2026, and then you started mentioning 2027. Originally this was meant to be 2021, so it seems to be sneaking along all the way. "I’m slightly concerned this will be forever in the distance, the quest for the holy grail."
The authority's interim delivery director for transport infrastructure Malcolm Parsons said it "will not be forever in the distance"."We are absolutely sure we have to have those facilities open, not least of which because the developer at Filton needs it. And we’ve made commitments to the region to deliver it," Mr Parsons added.
