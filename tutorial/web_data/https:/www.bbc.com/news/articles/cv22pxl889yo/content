A Kent tourist attraction says it is witnessing its best ever display of poppies. Thousands of the flowers have come into bloom in the jousting field at Lullingstone Castle. Botanist Tom Hart Dyke, who is co-owner and head gardener, said he had "never seen such a stunning display" in the 48 years he has lived there. Mr Hart Dyke described the display as "stupendous" and said it is attracting large crowds to the popular tourist destination to see them.  
Mr Hart Dyke said: "We don't know why we have such an amazing collection of common poppies this year. "It could have been something to do with the weather - the mild and wet first half to the year."We have also changed our ploughing techniques - which may have had an impact." 
Mr Hart Dyke said: "The poppy season is stunning but brief - normally lasting just a couple of weeks. And we're already 10 days in."Lullingstone Castle has been the family home of the Hart Dyke family for over 600 years. It has for a long time been considered a centre of floral excellence. Tom Hart Dyke created the World Garden there in 2005 to display the collections he had accumulated from his travels around the globe.
