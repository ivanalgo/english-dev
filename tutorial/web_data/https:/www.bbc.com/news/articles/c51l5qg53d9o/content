Hundreds of people living in a Gloucestershire town have signed a petition against housing plans.Cotswold District Councils local plan for housing could see an extra 1,500 homes in Moreton-in-Marsh by 2041.One resident said building plans were "the lazy option" for the council.Cotswold District Council said it was at the "very early stage of the process" but "takes the public views seriously".
The town's population has grown more than nearby Cirencester in the last decade.The District Council is hamstrung by a large part of the Cotswolds District being in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) meaning it can be more difficult to build.Therefore, as it looked to update its local plan for housing the authority has focused on expanding both Moreton-in-Marsh to the north of the District and Cirencester to the south.Sue Stapley is a lawyer who has lived in Moreton for two decades and said: "It's long overdue that we have some genuinely affordable housing", but added, "for the last 20 years Moreton has doubled in size." "This is completely untenable with the current crumbling infrastructure."Residents pointed to concerns around flooding, sewage and traffic.The number of local supermarkets was also seen as a problem.Resident Gina Stephens said: "If you want to actually shop you have to go outside of Moreton to do so."
The petition has received more than 700 signatures and was started by local resident Darren Curry."My view is that, building in Moreton is the lazy option for Cotswold District Council." Mr Curry said.Councillor Juliet Layton Cabinet Member for Planning and Regulatory Services said: “We are at the very beginning of the local planning process, and nothing has yet been decided.“Any development of this scale must be complemented with a suitable plan for infrastructure."“We take consultation with the public very seriously, and seek the views of all residents on the current proposals."As part of the process a ‘drop-in’ exhibition was held at Redesdale Hall in Moreton-in-Marsh which hundreds of residents attended.Residents wishing to share their views can do so by visiting the council’s website.
