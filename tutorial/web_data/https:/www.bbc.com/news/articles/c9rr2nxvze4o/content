A woman from Plymouth is taking part in a marathon walk in Iceland to raise money for a breast cancer charity.Suzy Bennett decided to take part in the 26 mile (42km) Full Moon MoonWalk after her mum was diagnosed with breast cancer. Charity events, organised by Walk the Walk, take place in London, Scotland and Iceland. Participants walk the overnight marathons wearing brightly decorated bras.Ms Bennett said she was "a little scared" about the prospect of completing her first full marathon, but it was a "fantastic goal."
She said: "I’m very excited to have signed up for two MoonWalks in 2024 – in London [half-marathon] and Iceland – inspired by what my mum has been through, but also as a huge challenge for myself."Ms Bennett, who is a comedian, said she had debuted a variety of different bras on previous fundraising walks. "As I’m from the Westcountry, my decorated bra one year was covered in pictures of pasties, which were surrounded by fairy lights," she said."My favourite one was space-themed, I was hosting the MoonWalk that year and glued chocolate bar wrappers like Mars, Milky Way and Galaxy to my bra and outfit."
The overnight trek will follow a route around Lake Myvatn.The walk takes place on Saturday during the period of midnight sun when there is almost 24 hours of daylight.Ms Bennett said: "Mum is keen to emphasise the importance of screening and continues to encourage everyone to take up the opportunity if it’s offered to them."It could save your life, like it did for mum."
