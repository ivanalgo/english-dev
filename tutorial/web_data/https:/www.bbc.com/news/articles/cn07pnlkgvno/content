A man who sexually abused two girls before fleeing the country to evade capture has been jailed for 24 years.Altaf Khalifa was found guilty of 11 offences, including two counts of rape, and sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on Thursday.Leicestershire Police said the 42-year-old went on the run while on bail, sparking an international manhunt lasting almost two years.Eight of his offences were against two girls, one of whom went on to take her own life.
Police said many of the crimes occurred at an address in Leicester between January 2016 and August 2019 when the girls were aged 8-10 and 13-15.Khalifa, of no fixed address, went on the run while on bail in July 2021, which led to an international manhunt that went on until September 2023, when he was found living in Malaga, Spain.He was found guilty of the offences earlier this year.
Leicestershire Police praised the bravery of his victims and paid tribute to the officers in the dedicated Child Abuse Investigation Unit (CAIU) who worked for more than four years to bring him to justice.Investigating officer Vanessa Murva said: “The circumstances surrounding this case are extremely sad and while I am pleased the defendant is now behind bars, it is deeply tragic that one of the girls is not here to see her abuser jailed for the immeasurable pain and suffering he caused.“It was her courage to speak out that first alerted us to the horrendous crimes being committed by Khalifa"Without the bravery of both girls, he may have continued to offend, and other girls may have become his victims.”If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, visit the BBC Action Line for support over suicide or sexual abuseFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
