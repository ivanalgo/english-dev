The last section of a huge military aircraft's fuselage has been moved to its new home.The only surviving Blackburn Beverley is in the process of being dismantled in Hull and moved to its new home at the Solway Aviation Museum in Carlisle, Cumbria.Known as Big Bev, the aeroplane was once the biggest transport aircraft used by the RAF.Dougie Kerr, from the museum, said lorries transporting sections of the plane had been on the roads all week, but work to move the wings was still to take place.
He said the wings had be to narrowed down to fit on wagons but was hopeful they would be moving to Carlisle within a week.
Big Bev was built in 1952 and was used to carry troops and cargo.The fuselage of the aeroplane was so big it could not fit through the gates at Fort Paull in Hull, where it was previously housed.A crane had to be used to lift it over the walls before it could be transported to Carlisle.
However, it could still be some time before Big Bev goes on display at the Solway Aviation Museum.Mr Kerr said it needed to be repainted and assembled, adding: "It's going to be next year before it gets put back together."
