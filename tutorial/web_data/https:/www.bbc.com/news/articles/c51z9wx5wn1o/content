Proposals to allow net fishing for grey mullet at a Devon beauty spot are “really concerning”, a conservation charity has said.Fishing with nets was banned in the estuary at Salcombe in 2018.However, it is being considered again by the Devon and Severn Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority (D&S IFCA) as part of a public consultation.Devon Wildlife Trust said the estuary, which is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest, should be protected.
The fisheries authority said the consultation was to consider whether there was public support for a proposal to open a fixed net fishery within the estuary between between 1 October and 31 March each year.Mat Mander, chief officer at D&S IFCA, said: "We know that there’s a real range of interests with fishing in estuaries."Let’s get those views so that members have a much more informed position when they make their decision in February on whether or not to allow netting to take place again in Salcombe."
Devon Wildlife Trust conservation manager Ed Parr Ferris said he was concerned the proposal could lead to bycatch."A netting fishery like this has real potential for catching other things that they’re not targeting," he said."As well as other fish species there’s things like birds, seals, cetaceans like dolphins and porpoises.“In a place like this that’s really concerning.”Grant Jones, sea angling engagement manager with the Angling Trust, said netting could wipe out some fish stocks.“The mullet that they’re targeting take 12 years to reach maturity,” he said.“There’s no chance that the mullet are going to sustain themselves for that long with the intensity of netting that would take place.”The public consultation ends on 19 January, with D&S IFCA members to make a decision on the issue at a public meeting at Exeter racecourse on 22 February.
