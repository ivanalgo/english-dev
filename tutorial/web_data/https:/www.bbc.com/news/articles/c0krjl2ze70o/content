Messages will be played every 15 minutes over a speaker system in Grimsby to tackle anti-social behaviour.Short messages reminding people of the rules around cycling in the pedestrian zone will be played at the Bull Ring and Victoria Street South from Wednesday.The trial is being run by North East Lincolnshire Council.Councillor Ron Shepherd, the council's portfolio holder for communities, said people behaving in an anti-social way should "be made aware of what they are doing and reprimanded accordingly".
A public space protection order (PSPO) prohibits cycling in Victoria Street South and is one of seven in place across North East Lincolnshire. Others include restrictions on street drinking, foul language and climbing buildings.“Additionally, this new [speaker] system will be a way of educating a wider audience as visitors and residents go about their daily business," he added. "Should the trial be successful, we look forward to expanding its use in the future.”Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
