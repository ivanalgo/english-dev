Schools in Wales may have just broken up for the summer, but many parents will already be thinking of the expense of sending their children back in September.New school uniforms can be expensive, but there is support available to help with these and other costs.There are initiatives across Wales aimed at easing the strain on the bank account, with free meals about to become available for all primary pupils, as well as grants to help with those back to school essentials.So what help is out there?
The School Essentials Grant offers up to £200 per child to cover the cost of school equipment, although it is only available to families on a low income, or children in local authority care.A Welsh government spokesperson said it was "doing everything we can to support families," which would “ensure children and young people get the best start in life".The grant can be used to pay for:Applicants need to contact their local authority to apply for the grant, which offers £125 per child, or £200 for children moving into Year 7.The 2024 scheme closes on 31 May 2025 and eligibility is often tied to free school meals.
While low-income families across Wales have until now been able to get free school meals, from September it will be expanded to all primary age children, regardless of family income.Originally, the scheme was only available for children in reception classes, but has since grown.Parents and guardians will still need to register for them. But it will not be available in secondary schools, where they will remain means tested.You can find out whether your family is eligible with the free school meals checker.
Communities across Wales have set up school uniform banks.Often the work of parents or schools, they collect outgrown school uniforms that can be repurposed for other children.Caerphilly Uniform Exchange is one of these, allowing parents to buy school uniform at a discount, or swap their old uniforms for new ones.“We help on average 50 families each month just from our Caerphilly shop,” said Lisa Watkins, who founded Caerphilly Uniform Exchange in 2022.“They come home two weeks into term and say: ‘I’ve lost my PE kit’ or ‘I’ve lost my tie’ and people are constantly replacing things,” she said.They allow parents to get hold of pricier items, such as sweaters, cheaper than in school uniform shops, which can be an option for those who do not mind second-hand clothes.“It’s essential that we create these recycling schemes,” she said. “The more they exist, the less stigma there is against buying second-hand.”However, it is not all second-hand; some uniform banks get hold of new clothes too.“We do link up with stores like Asda and Tesco to take all of their end-of-line stock. You wouldn’t believe what’s left over every year.”“A gingham dress, for example: they will change something tiny with the style, so it might just be one year they have the gingham collar, the next year they add on a white collar, but when things become end of line stock, places like Asda and Tesco get rid of those, so that all comes to us as well, then we can sell it on for a very small donation.”
The Welsh government has urged schools to allow uniform items without school badges.“School uniforms are an important part of identity for a school, but it is absolutely vital that uniforms are affordable,” said former Education Minister Jeremy Miles.“We know that branded school wear can be a lot more expensive for families - that is why schools shouldn't make them mandatory.”As a result, opting for supermarket brand school uniform items could be a decent option, especially if there are deals on at a local store.“Some schools are now stocking iron-on logos, which cost £1 per patch,” said Ms Watkins. She said some, such as Idris Davies School in Rhymney, Caerphilly county, gave out several free logos each term, so parents could go and buy a generic uniform from supermarkets.Parents are advised to check with their child's school to find out what support is available.
