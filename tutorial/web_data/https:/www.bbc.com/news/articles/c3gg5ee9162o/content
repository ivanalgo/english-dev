A police officer accused of misconduct after his former boss was pulled over for suspected drink-driving has been cleared.PC Lee Umpleby, an Avon and Somerset police dog handler, wept as a tribunal ruled he genuinely believed Sgt Steve Knight would be over the limit on his way to work. PC Umpleby attended the scene after Sgt Knight had been stopped on 14 May 2023, something the misconduct panel chair, Jenny Tallentire, said was "unwise and inappropriate"."His behaviour was an attempt to do the right thing, but it was done in the wrong way," she added.
PC Umpleby, based in Almondsbury, South Gloucestershire, told the hearing that he had previously clashed with Sgt Knight, who he used to work with at the MoD Police in Corsham, Wiltshire.PC Umpleby, who joined Avon and Somerset Constabulary after resigning from his role in Corsham, said he and several ex-colleagues suspected that the sergeant was intoxicated during occasional weekend overtime shifts.
A two-day police misconduct hearing at the force's headquarters in Portishead heard PC Umpleby organised an operation for the roadside stop on his ex-line manager.The constable lay in wait near Sgt Knight’s home around dawn, and then followed his car for several miles.  Two traffic officers stopped and breathalysed the sergeant - with the test proving negative, the panel heard.PC Umpleby attended the scene while this took place, which the force’s solicitor alleged was intended as humiliation. The panel ruled this action was “unwise and inappropriate”.
The constable told the hearing that he feared someone could be killed, either on the road or through Sgt Knight’s work as a firearms officer in charge of the MoD police station.Announcing the panel’s decision on Tuesday, Legally Qualified Chair (LQC) Jenny Tallentire said they found neither gross misconduct nor misconduct, despite the officer having accepted the latter before the hearing.She said: “The officer has stated he had long-held concerns that Sgt Knight was in the habit of driving when under the influence of alcohol.“It is apparent from the statements that there was gossip at RAF Fairford and MoD Corsham about Sgt Knight’s consumption of alcohol.“The panel found [PC Umpleby’s] evidence to be credible and believable, and considered him to be an honest witness."The officer was carrying out his duties as he understood them to the best of his abilities."She said the panel found just one of the alleged breaches of professional standards proven – failing to submit an intelligence report – which PC Umpleby admitted at an early stage, and that they did not find any involving dishonesty proven.The panel rejected allegations that the officer obtained unauthorised information, made a false statement that he had reliable and credible intelligence that Sgt Knight would be drink-driving, and failed to notify Avon & Somerset Police about their previous association.Ms Tallentire concluded it was a "training and management issue" rather than a misconduct issue.
