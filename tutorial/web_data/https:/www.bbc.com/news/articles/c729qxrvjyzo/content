A Warwickshire tennis club has thrown its support behind Marcus Willis after he reached the Wimbledon mixed doubles quarter-finals.The Warwick Boat Club-based player and his partner Alicia Barnett are due to face Santiago Gonz√°lez and Giuliana Olmos of Mexico on Court 1 about 16:00 BST.Jon Browning, tennis chairman at the club, described Willis, 33, as "a special talent but also a special person"."He really does spread that warmth and affection and excitement for tennis across our various groups," he added.
Mr Browning was at the All England Club on Wednesday to watch Willis and Barnett beat Americans Katie Volynets and Rajeev Ram 2-6 6-3 11-9.Willis arranged for him and some of the club's top juniors to watch from the players' box."Despite going a set down they really dug in and had that faith in themselves," his club-mate said."It was a brilliant atmosphere, not just for Marcus but also for Alicia... the crowd really warmed to the obvious chemistry they have as a tennis pair on court."Warwick Boat Club members have been celebrating the player's progress, with WhatsApp groups "bursting to life" when he steps out on court."Even if it's a virtual presence, everybody is cheering him on," Mr Browning added."He's an incredible individual to play at the level he does, but also engage with different types of groups at the tennis club."
This year marks Willis's first time at Wimbledon since 2017, the year after he sprang to fame after facing Roger Federer on Centre Court as a qualifier.Having retired from singles, the player said he now had to "pinch himself" at his current doubles ranking of 96."It's been a really positive experience to see him have that moment in the spotlight then have to regroup and go again," said Mr Browning."I saw the combination of talent and humility that kind of defines Marcus."Meanwhile, Willis said his Federer moment felt like "a lifetime ago"."The three times I've come here, something incredible's happened. I'm just incredibly grateful," he said.
