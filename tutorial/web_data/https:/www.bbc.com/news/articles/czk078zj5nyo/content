Face mask rules have been reintroduced at acute hospitals in Worcestershire after a rise in the number of patients developing Covid-19.The policy applies to staff, patients and visitors, and covers all clinical areas at Redditch's Alexandra, Kidderminster, and the Worcestershire Royal hospitals.In a statement, Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust (WAH) said the measure was "necessary to protect patients, their loved ones, and our hospital staff from the risk of infection".The trust said it was currently treating 65 patients with Covid-19, the "highest number" since December 2023.
"This is the highest number of Covid positive inpatients seen since December 2023, the amount of time our Covid positive patients need to be in hospital is increasing suggesting that they are also more seriously ill," a spokesperson said.The trust said the measures would be applied with immediate effect, and would stay in place until further notice.Masks are being made available at all sites.
