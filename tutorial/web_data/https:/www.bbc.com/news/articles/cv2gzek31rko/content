Artists at a major exhibition which opens this weekend have spoken at their pride in being chosen to show their work.The Three Counties Open Art Exhibition opens later, featuring artists from across Staffordshire, Cheshire and Shropshire.268 artists entered paintings, sculptures and other artwork with 98 pieces selected for display at the School of Art building in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent.Peter Davis said: "I'm a classic case of an emerging artist, really finding their feet with the help from people like the Three Counties exhibition."
He is one of the selected exhibitors, who made the move from a career in advertising to a full-time artist within the last nine years.Mr Davis insisted that the diversity and quality of the exhibits meant that even people who do not consider themselves art lovers would find something they enjoy."Art is genuinely for everybody. If you came to this show I think you'd take away something that you didn't know before," he insists.Charn√© Visser, originally from South Africa and now living in Stoke-on-Trent, agreed that people should not think art was elitist and for people with money."Art is something that is supposed to cross all barriers in terms of culture and language. Anyone can look at a piece and feel something."Ms Visser was awarded an artist residency as a result of last year's exhibition, which she said was "phenomenal both personally and professionally"."Coming to Stoke as a foreigner, you can easily live on the outskirts or apart from the community; but it gave me the opportunity to speak to people in the area and submerge myself more in the culture," she explained. 
The gallery is open to the public with free entry between Tuesday and Saturday from 11:00-16:00 BST, and visitors have the opportunity to vote for their favourite piece.The winning entries will be announced on 16 August and the audience choice award will be revealed once the exhibition closes on 24 August.
