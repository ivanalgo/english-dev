The number of little tern fledglings at a seaside resort has hit record levels.Durham Wildlife Trust warden Derek Wood said 140 of the birds had developed wing feathers large enough for flight at Seaton Carew in Hartlepool this year."The numbers follow an improving year-on-year trend," he said.Earlier this month the birds set off on their annual three-month migratory journey to The Gambia in west Africa.
Last year the team recorded 125 fledglings at Seaton Carew, whereas in 2022 there were just 89. This year's numbers follow the wildlife trust putting up a protective fence around the bird nests in 2022.But Mr Wood said the fence was breached by a fox several times this year which triggered an early departure of the birds from the UK. Little terns, the smallest terns in the UK, typically leave Seaton Carew in mid to late August.
