A council facing a near-£1m financial deficit is to lobby the government for support. A report showed that North Norfolk District Council had overspent on projects and lost money from a cancelled event.It aims to persuade members of the Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities that more money is needed to cope with their financial difficulties. The Liberal Democrat-led council will meet with representatives from the government on Wednesday.
The council is facing a £986,000 deficit by the end of the month due to rising costs, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service. A report detailing the costs and losses of the council's budget was shown to members during a cabinet meeting on Monday. It showed the council had spent more than £1m on temporary accommodation, £200,000 on agency staff, and overspent £35,000 on repairs to car parking machines. Energy costs had gone over budget by £123,000, and £60,000 was spent on emergency tree works. The cancellation of the Mammoth Marathon in May 2023 also cost the council £35,000. Despite overspending in some areas, the council said this has been balanced out by savings and increased income.
Lucy Shires, portfolio holder for finance at the council, said one of the biggest problems facing the authority was the cost of temporary accommodation. She said housing subsidies from the government only covered half of the costs. Deputy leader Wendy Fredericks hoped that the meeting with the government will allow the council to show that there is a "unique need of housing" in north Norfolk. Ms Fredericks said the council had "tried everything we can" to cope with their financial problems. Council leader Tim Adams said it was good that the council was on the government's radar and hopes they can "work together" and highlight problems they are "continually facing".
