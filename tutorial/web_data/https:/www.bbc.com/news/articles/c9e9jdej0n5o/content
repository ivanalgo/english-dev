A metal detectorist who has reunited hundreds of people with lost items has been dubbed "Batman" by one grateful teenager.Darren Wiles, from Bournemouth, has scanned beaches, gardens, the sea, and even dogs, to find missing keys, phones and jewellery.In his latest mission, he recovered a chain given to 18-year-old Jamie Holland for his landmark birthday that was lost in the sand on the beach.Mr Holland said Mr Wiles was "like Batman" because he was there in his hour of need.
Mr Holland was given the chain by his parents in December but on 25 June he removed it to swim in the sea, putting it on top of his clothes.
His mother, Carrie Holland, said: "When he came back and picked his clothes up, all his jewellery just went everywhere."He was looking for about an hour and he managed to find his rings, but he and his friends just couldn't find his chain."Presumably, as they were sweeping through the sand, they must have been burying it deeper and deeper."Ms Holland said her son found the Bournemouth Metal Detecting Club And Free Recovery Service on Facebook so she posted a message on 28 June.At about 06:30 BST the next morning, Mr Wiles sent Ms Holland a photo of the chain, after finding it at 04:40."I just couldn't believe it, I was amazed," she said. "I went into my son's room - who is never awake at 6.30am - and said [Mr Wiles] has found your chain, and my son was so relieved and said, 'what a lovely, lovely man'."Jamie said he is like Batman because he is someone you can call in your hour of need and doesn't do it for financial gain, but to help people, which is very rare these days."
Mr Wiles, who lives in Winton, has found more than 250 items for people.He said: "I've been asked to search a dog before because someone thought it had eaten their ring."It's all about patience, I think a lot of people think you just rock up and find it, and it can take hours but if you put in the time you sometimes get the rewards for it - and my wife Amanda has been very supportive."He said one woman gave him a "massive hug" after he found two rings she lost at sea.He said: "That's the reason I do it, it's nice to see people's faces and reactions when you return stuff."
