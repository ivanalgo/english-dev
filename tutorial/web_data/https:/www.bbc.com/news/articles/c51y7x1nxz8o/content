A restoration project at Jersey's Elizabeth Castle is set to finish in October.Work to bring the former officers' quarters and the military hospital block back to their former glory started in January.A fortification was first built on the site - a tidal island off St Helier - in the 6th Century and those calling it home included Sir Walter Raleigh and the exiled King Charles II.Chris O’Connor, the head of property at Jersey Heritage and project lead, said: "The hospital block has been in the planning stages for the best part of 30 years. It’s one of the only Georgian military hospitals left in the UK so has incredible historic importance."
Jersey Heritage - which is responsible for the island's major historic sites, museums and public archives - estimates the project will cost more than £6m, which it has funded through revenue and a government grant.Local contractors, Building Renovations, are leading on the work using period correct techniques and materials, including oak, mineral felt and even limestone instead of cement."It has been a bit of a learning curve," said Mr O'Connor."They’ve taken it on with a lot of enthusiasm and are deeply interested in being part of it, along with coming up with ideas to rectify problems which are causing us issues."
