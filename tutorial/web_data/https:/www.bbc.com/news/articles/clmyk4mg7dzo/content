A 28-acre country park partly built on a former landfill site in West Sussex has opened to the public.Creating the new green space was a condition when planning permission was granted for the New Monks Farm housing development, in Shoreham.The country park was previously tidal marshland before becoming part of a landfill site, but after “extensive refurbishment” it will now be home to a diverse range of wildlife.“It’s come from essentially nothing to a really lovely park that we’re hoping everyone in the local area will enjoy,” said civil engineer Stuart Magowan.
Mr Magowan said his team of engineers have cleared away the industrial waste, created new waterways and enhanced existing ones, planted 340 trees and installed grasslands, reeds and wildflowers.“The whole team are exceptionally proud of what we’ve achieved here,” he said.It is hoped the new habitats will attract pollinator species such as bees and butterflies, as well as voles and wetland birds.Areas of trees and scrub will provide habitats for deer, badgers and other mammals known to visit the site.Construction of the park was completed a year ago but developers allowed the vegetation to establish itself before opening the area.
