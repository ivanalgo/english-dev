The native language of the Isle of Man has become more widely accessible around the world, after it was added to Google Translate.Manx, a Celtic language credited with surviving the threat of extinction, is one of 110 languages newly added to the service using Artificial Intelligence (AI).Fisherman Ned Maddrell, who died in 1974, is touted as the last native speaker of Manx, but a subsequent revival has led to 69 schoolchildren currently being taught in the language at the native-speaking school, Bunscoill Ghaelgagh.Breesha Maddrell, a director of Culture Vannin, called the launch of Manx on Google Translate an "exciting step", but warned it may not be totally accurate. 
It is estimated there are 2,200 speakers of Manx on the Isle of Man, including more than 1,000 children who are taught the language in school, with proposals to see that figure double by 2032. Dr Maddrell said the Manx Language Research Group had worked to disseminate more of the Manx language online, which had allowed Google's AI technology to collate it for translation purposes.However, she has advised people not to rely on the service for accuracy, suggesting users of Google Translate check any phrases against Culture Vannin's own translation service."You can go into Google Translate at the moment and get good some phrases of Manx - and you can get some phrases that aren't accurate," said Dr Maddrell"It would be dreadful if people tattooed something wrongly on their arm, or spent a lot of money putting it on a plaque or in a document," she added.Despite its diminutive size, Dr Maddrell said there was interest all over the world in the Isle of Man and its language, noting a recent New York Times' feature on the revival of Manx."We're a small nation - and we've got this really large reach," she said, thanking volunteers and the island's government for their support.
