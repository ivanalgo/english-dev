A woman who skipped jury duty has been ordered to pay £1,000.  Shania Begum, 29, will be sent to prison for 14 days if she fails to stump up the money within 28 days, a judge at Liverpool Crown Court said. Begum was found in contempt of court after ignoring phone calls and warning letters demanding an explanation for her absence. She also failed to attend on Monday when she was sentenced. Begum, of Tully Avenue in Newton-le-Willows, had been due to begin her jury service on 11 March. When a member of court staff rang her to ask why she had failed to attend, Begum put the phone down and ignored a voice mail message.
The court heard Begum also ignored a registered delivery letter telling to her to attend to explain her absence.The Recorder of Liverpool, Judge Andrew Menary, KC, said he was satisfied the letter had been delivered. He fined her the maximum sum for contempt under the Jurors Act.Judge Menary said he was "quite satisfied" the case was a "deliberate contempt". “Jury service, as everybody must understand, is a very important civic duty", he said."These courts cannot operate, trials cannot run unless members of the public diligently attend in response to summons, and give of their time.”After handing down the sentence Judge Menary said if Begum wished to make representations about the fine she had 56 days in which to do so.
