A businessman has been given the go-ahead to open a cafe and bar despite objections from people living nearby.Matthew Taylor says he wants The Alcademy in Chesterton Road, Cambridge, to be a "community-based hub".Neighbours had raised concerns about noise and street drinking and Cambridge City Council received more than 20 objections.A council licensing sub-committee granted a licence but imposed limits on opening hours.
Councillors restricted the hours alcohol could be sold at the bar to between 1200 and 1900 BST from Monday to Sunday - and said no alcohol could be drunk outside.Mr Taylor plans to open the bar on the site of a former HSBC bank branch, and says he also aims to offer plays, classes, and films.Councillors heard arguments from Mr Taylor and neighbours at a recent licensing sub-committee meeting.
Mr Taylor told councillors that his "objective" was to create a "community based hub", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.He argued that noise concerns raised by neighbours were “unreasonable” and suggested that people had wrongly formed the opinion that he was “setting up some nightclub”.“We do not want to upset our neighbours, we need to get the venue open and can then listen to what people say and respond," he said. "If there are any problems with noise emanating from the building I will ensure we deal with it.”
Neighbours said Mr Taylor had not properly consulted with them about the plans to open the new bar.Alexis Mather, who lives near the site of the bar,  said  there had been a “massive expansion” of places selling alcohol along Chesterton Road in recent years.Mr Mather asked for the application to be declined.He said he wanted time for people to go through "community engagement and discussion" and reach a compromise.
