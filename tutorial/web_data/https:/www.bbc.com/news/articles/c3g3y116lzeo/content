Megan Brown, of The Strand Collective, said the main goal was "to uplift the local independent creative community, by providing a platform to showcase their talents on the Fylde Coast".
“Each of our traders brings high-quality, handmade goods that epitomise artistic craftsmanship," she said. "From delightful treats to captivating art and craft items, our diverse range of traders promises a unique shopping experience."The event is being held at the council-owned Abingdon Street Market which has undergone a major overhaul in recent years to create a food hall and trading area, thanks to a £3.6m injection of government cash.
