Councillors in Brighton and Hove are to decide on Thursday where the city's new leisure facility will be built.Members of the City Council's cabinet will choose between building on the site of the existing King Alfred Leisure Centre on Hove seafront, or at a new location.The project will cost £47m and follows an 18-month public consultation, with 70 per cent in favour of building on the existing site.The authority is expected to opt for the existing location.
The alternative site is land the council already owns south of Sainsbury's supermarket in West Hove.Refurbishing the existing centre is not considered economically viable, as it would only extend its life by 10 years.
Rob Hill, a resident of Brighton for 30 years, told BBC Radio Sussex: "This site's been here for a very long time, people know where it is."They don't use it because it's outdated."Carlotta Turnbull said she would enjoy seeing the King Alfred site being given a new lease of life."My dad used to take me," she said. "It's really good to see they're making it brand spanking new for the kids to enjoy now."Fellow Brightonian Conan Peacock said: "This is the place where King Alfred is. I'd prefer it here."
Alan Robins, cabinet member for sports and recreation, said: “The King Alfred Leisure Centre is still popular and well loved, but it’s near the end of its life, is in constant need of repair and is expensive to run.“Having looked at what residents said, alongside cost and viability, we believe a new facility on the existing site will deliver a modern, energy efficient leisure centre that residents can be proud of for years to come.”The council hope to have the new centre ready for use by 2028.
