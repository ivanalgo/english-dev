Repeatedly closing Liverpool's waterfront for events is having a negative impact on tourists' experience of the city, a tour guide has said.Blue badge guide Simone Peter said city visitors were unable to access the iconic attractions they had come to see when the waterfront was used for concerts.Her comments come after the Pier Head was fenced off this week for the four day On The Waterfront event during what she said was peak tourism season.Liverpool City Council said the waterfront venue provided a "spectacular" backdrop for events which helped attract new visitors to the city.
Ms Peter said guides in the city lead tours to around 500,000 people a year with most including tours of the iconic waterfront.Ms Peters said while she welcomed events which attracted visitors to the city, closing access to key tourist attractions in peak tourist season did not make sense."Our waterfront has got amazing landmark buildings major attractions, including Beatles statue, and in itself is a major destination for Liverpool tourists," she said."For many visitors they're finding they are turning up in the city and they are seeing the area blocked off, behind large barriers and fences."Visitors wouldn't expect to go to other places or cities such as Rome and see the Colosseum treated like this, or go to Venice and see St Mark's Square behind big barriers that they couldn't access."She is calling for events to be held in different locations such as Sefton Park or the North Docks.
In May the site was used as a location for Malmo on The Mersey Eurovision song contest screening and live performances.Earlier this month Queen Anne naming ceremony concert took place with live performances by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and opera singer Andrea Bocelli and a DJ set by Craig Charles.The On The Waterfront event will see the area boarded off from Thursday until Sunday.Next month the Pride in Liverpool festival is set to take place at the site.
A Liverpool City Council representative said: “As a UNESCO City of Music, we are fortunate to have a stunning location on our waterfront that provides a spectacular natural backdrop to hold events.“They bring in much-needed income which we use to finance local cultural organisations, and contribute towards the cost of free events such as Africa Oye in Sefton Park and River of Light.“They also attract new visitors who then come back again and again, helping support our visitor economy, upon which hundreds of businesses and tens of thousands of jobs are dependent.“We strive to maintain safe access to the Pier Head as much as possible during the setting up and derigging of an event.”On The Waterfront event organisers have been contacted for comment.
