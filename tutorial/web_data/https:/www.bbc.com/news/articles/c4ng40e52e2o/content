Plans have been revealed to transform a former Devon youth centre and community space into a work hub, a council says.Mid Devon District Council said the Market Centre in Tiverton would be an ideal location for such a facility, which would provide flexible office space. The council said it had identified a "strong demand" for a work hub, particularly from self-employed homeworkers and employees of larger organisations who often worked remotely It added that small local start-up businesses and people visiting and holidaying in the area that required reliable Wi-fi would also benefit.
Two events were being held at the centre building's car park on Thursday and Friday to discuss the proposals and answer questions, the council said. Cabinet member for planning and economic regeneration Stephen Keable explained the plan would provide the opportunity to "support business growth as well as enhance the footfall and vibrancy of the town centre". "Co-working space provides small businesses the ability to come together and collaborate, avoiding the isolation that often exists when working from home and the difficulty of separating home and work life," Cllr Keable added.A consultation process was under way until 5 August, the council said, and consultation boards were also on display at the events, as well as on the council's website.
