A waking charity has said it is expanding a free training programme that aims to break down the barriers that prevent young people from getting outdoors.The Ramblers’ Out There Award was first launched in Scotland in 2019 and will now be offered to up to 70 people in South West England. Events for 18 to 26-year-olds will be hosted in Bristol, Taunton and Bridgwater, no matter what their background, budget or experience.Walking experience officer with The Ramblers, Kate Davis, said: "We know the Out There Award has the most positive impact for people who face the biggest barriers in accessing nature."
The programme, which takes place over two days, gives people the chance to gain basic outdoor skills.Heather Thomson, from Glasgow, completed the award in 2022 and said the experience was "invaluable". “I had a family who was not very active in the outdoors and gathering the needed kit can be overwhelming and costly," she said."I remember thinking where do I start?"
The programme is designed for young people interested in gaining skills, making new friends or improving their health through gentler walks.The Ramblers charity said that lacking walking partners, knowledge of where to walk, or finding the time to get out in nature, are all reasons behind young people struggling to get outdoors.Ms Davis said: “We’re excited to be able to offer the Out There Award in the South West for the first time"In this area of England there are high number of young people who may not have the funds to buy outdoor equipment, or who haven't had the opportunities and support to explore where they can walk. "It's also an area where many young people don't have cars, so even getting to green places can feel intimidating. "The Out There Award is designed to be as inclusive and welcoming as possible, so that everyone has the opportunity to get out, feel confident and enjoy walking."After completing the programme, 96% of participants reported feeling confident that they had the appropriate levels of skill and knowledge to go walking safely.This is up from 36% in their pre-award surveys.Everyone who completes the award gets a free starter kit full of outdoor essentials and a year of free Ramblers membership.
