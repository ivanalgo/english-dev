A man has been arrested and charged as part of an investigation into an organised people smuggling ring suspected of operating in the UK.Ramal Briem, an Iraqi national living in Wolverhampton, was detained by National Crime Agency officers on Thursday.The 31-year-old was arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration at a property in Crawford Road in the city.He is alleged to have been involved in a smuggling operation in March 2024 that saw six people transported to Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, in the back of a lorry.
Investigators are also linking him to an organised crime group involved in small boat crossings, four suspected members of which were arrested by the NCA in April. Three were later charged, while a fourth is facing extradition proceedings because he is wanted in France.Mr Briem was later charged with facilitation offences and appeared before Wolverhampton magistrates on Friday.NCA senior investigating officer Saju Sasikumar, said: "This arrest is part of an ongoing investigation into organised immigration crime."People smugglers operate for profit without concern for the safety of those they transport, whether that be in the backs of lorries or in small boats."This is why dismantling and disrupting the networks involved remains a priority for the NCA."
