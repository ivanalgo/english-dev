A female grey seal that was found with a plastic flying ring embedded in its neck has been released back to the sea after weeks of rehabilitation.The seal - named Ghost Bug - was taken to East Winch Wildlife Centre after she was rescued by the Friends of Horsey Seals in April. Vets battled to remove the ring which had caused a "severe" and infected wound, leaving the animal exhausted and underweight. Evangelos Achilleos, centre manager, said: "We are once again so grateful to the rescuers who brought her in to us - catching a large adult, even when they are very sick, is a difficult task."
The RSPCA has been campaigning for beachgoers to stop using the toys at the seaside.
Mr Achilleos added: "I still find it hard to believe that so many seals have these flying rings around their neck."This small toy, when caught around a seal, can cause so much damage."We only see the ones who are thankfully rescued. It’s just awful to think that there will be others out there who have suffered a sad fate because of man-made items polluting our seas."
Although the grey seal's injury had healed well, she would be left with a permanent scar, he added. Ghost Bug was successfully released back into the sea at Horsey Beach, Norfolk. "It’s always a very moving moment when you watch them return back to the wild - it’s just wonderful knowing that thanks to everyone’s efforts this seal has been given a second chance," Mr Achilleos said.
