A lake has been drained after its sluice gates were opened without permission.Redcar and Cleveland Council said the water level at the lake in Locke Park, in Redcar, significantly dropped when the gates were removed on Tuesday.The sluice gates were replaced but were removed again on Wednesday, causing the lake to "drain completely".The council said removing the gates harmed local wildlife and could injure those involved.
Sluice gates are a type of lock used to control the flow of water.A spokesperson said the council hoped the lake would be gradually refilled from the storm overflow system.Anyone with information about the removal of the sluice gates has been asked to contact the authority.
Cleveland Police said it received a report on Wednesday about the removal of the gates and had launched an appeal for information.
