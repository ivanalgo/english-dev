A police force has laid out a plan to tackle a rise in shoplifting offences.Crime data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 14% increase in shoplifting in Wiltshire in the 12 months prior to March 2024.Wiltshire Police said retailers would now receive increased crime prevention measures, including additional CCTV coverage and officer patrols.“We will continue to be relentless in our pursuit of criminals," said Chief Constable Catherine Roper.
Retail crime has been high on the national agenda in recent weeks after the introduction of a specific offence for assaulting a shop worker and a government pledge, outlined in the King’s Speech, to remove the £200 threshold currently in place for prosecuting shoplifters.“Shoplifting should not be dismissed as a victimless, lower-level crime," said Police and Crime Commissioner Philip Wilkinson."We’re seeing an increasing trend of shoplifting being used by organised crime groups to fuel criminality, and the impact on retailers, employees and the wider community should not be understated," he added.Mr Wilkinson said this impact was further felt when "intimidation and threats of violence" accompany shoplifting offences, thereby causing retailers "both economic and physical harm". 
Despite an increase in shoplifting, the ONS statistics also showed Wiltshire recorded the fewest number of crimes in England, including a 28% decrease in robbery and a 22% decrease in residential burglary.Chief Constable Catherine Roper said her team was "dedicated" to keeping Wiltshire safe. "These latest figures from the ONS showing Wiltshire as having the lowest overall recorded crime rate of all forces in the country are a reflection of this commitment to our communities.“However, these statistics also show that we still have victims of crime across the county who are suffering from the unscrupulous people who are still causing harm."
