A worldwide IT outage is affecting GP surgeries across Shropshire, with some practices being unable to operate as normal.The outage means services like appointment booking and patient records are not working.Microsoft said it was taking mitigation action, but the cause had not been confirmed."If it's not urgent for today, then please don't contact your GP," said Dr Jess Harvey, clinical lead for GP surgeries in the south east of Shropshire.
"If it's something your pharmacy might be able to deal with, please drop down," she said. She urged the public to "be kind" to health professionals as they worked through the issues."What we're trying to do is balance patient safety, your health needs, alongside us working safely," she told the BBC."We need to make sure that anything we do is in your best interests."The IT issues also affected airlines, banks, train companies and media across the world.
The Caxton surgery in Oswestry said it had been affected, and asked patients with routine queries or bookings to call on Monday, or submit an e-consultation.It said urgent calls would be taken, and appointments for Friday would go ahead."We will do the best we can when you are here," it said.Portcullis surgery in Ludlow said it would provide a very limited service until the issue was resolved.
