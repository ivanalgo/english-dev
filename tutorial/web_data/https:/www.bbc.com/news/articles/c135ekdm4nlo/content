After retracing their route at the shopping centre, with no sign of the toy, Lincoln's family took to social media.In the appeal, Lincoln, who has Osteogenesis Imperfecta, said Iron Man who he has had since he was born goes "everywhere with me... he's been there through all my operations - I really miss him."The genetic defect causes Lincoln's bones to fracture or break easily.Emily Vickery, who works in Primark and found the cherished toy, said: "I had watched the video and it made me really sad."
Ms Vickery said she was tidying up in the stock room at the end of a shift "turned around and just saw Iron Man sitting in this box and it just clicked... it was Lincoln's Iron Man."I don't know how he managed to get down there." Lincoln returned to the store with his family to get the toy back.On meeting Ms Vickery, he said: "Thank you... just thank you."Ms Vickery said: "It was very emotional....I was just so happy to give him back."
