Locations for a network of electric vehicle (EV) charge points set to be installed across Surrey have been proposed.The rollout is being overseen by a partnership between Surrey County Council and Connected Kerb, a charge point provider.The council said it would enable residents to "make the switch to an EV" and "provide a reliable network to meet the growing demand". Chris Pateman-Jones, Connected Kerb's chief executive, said: "It is a huge project that demonstrates real ambition of trying to make sure that charging infrastructure is accessible for everyone in society."
The government has set a target of 300,000 public charge points across the country in the next seven years.Mr Pateman-Jones said: "These sorts of projects are going to be pretty fundamental in delivering that scale of charging."Matt Furniss, Surrey County Council cabinet member for transport infrastructure and growth, said the project would "enable residents to make the switch to an EV".He said it would provide a "reliable network" to meet the "growing demand".
Surrey County Council said the locations proposed have been selected because someone has requested one in a certain area, or because there was no nearby access to a charge point.An interactive map of the current proposed locations is available on the Connected Kerb website.Requests can still be made and more locations will be added soon. The charge points are set to be installed in phases.
