People in Guernsey will find it easier to make complaints about telecoms issues under an initiative announced by The States of Guernsey.It said it was working with The Guernsey Competition and Regulatory Authority (GCRA) to improve the current system. The States of Guernsey's Trading Standards Service (TSS) said consumers were "unhappy with the service they received from their telecoms provider". It said the co-operation agreement (MOU) between the two organisations was an "important step forward". 
Chief Executive of the GCRA Michael Byrne said: "While no telecoms provider wants to fall out with its customers, situations do arise that cannot be resolved directly. "Having an independent third party to turn to is an asset for consumers and this MOU plugs a gap in the complaints process.‚ÄùA new law in 2023 gave island consumers important new rights when they bought goods and services in Guernsey,  in which TSS is formally recognised as the body responsible for consumer protection. It said the two organisations would work "flexibly together" and also agreed to co-operate and exchange information more generally in order to benefit both consumers and businesses.
Robin Gonard, Chief Trading Standards Officer of the TSS added they were delighted to have been able to "design a solution".  He said: "By offering a professional, independent review mechanism, we believe this will benefit consumers and providers alike."
