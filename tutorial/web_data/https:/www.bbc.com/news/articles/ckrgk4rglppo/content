Villagers have been asked to knit teddies - known as "bobby buddies" - to be used by their local police force.Musgrave Parish Institute in Cumbria is hosting a village show next month which includes a "bobby buddy" competition category.The teddy bears are kept in police vehicles to help children in traumatic incidents such as car crashes."Each bear could have a genuinely positive impact on a young child going through a difficult time," Cumbria Police said.
Karen Brownrigg, a Musgrave Parish Institute committee member, said the teddies will be donated to Cumbria Police and the entry money raised will go to the running of the parish building.Ms Brownrigg said: "We're not a very big community, but it [the building] is a hub of the community."Musgrave Parish Institute is celebrating its centenary this year. 
Cumbria Police said officers use the teddies "to help build trust and a relationship with young people and to take their minds off what is going on around them".People living in a 5-mile (8km) radius of the hall can enter a "bobby buddy" to be judged during the show on 25 August.The teddies must be small and should have no hard pieces, like button eyes or noses.Ms Brownrigg said there was no pressure on competitors as people do not take the village show entries "very seriously""We had a novelty course for dogs last year and they all went the wrong way round," she said.When asked for top tips on creating a winning "bobby buddy" entry, Ms Brownrigg said: "It's up to the judge."Something that looks nice, a kind looking bear."
