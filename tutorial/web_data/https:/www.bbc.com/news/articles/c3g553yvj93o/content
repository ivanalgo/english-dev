University students are being offered free hot meals to help alleviate the stress of exam season.The Have Dinner on Us initiative is providing those studying at the University of Portsmouth with evening meals every Monday and Tuesday until 25 June.Food will be made by hospitality apprentices from Havant and South Downs College and served between 17:00 and 18:00 BST.It is hoped the support will help students focus on their end-of-year assignments.
Apprentices from the college will use the university's kitchen facilities to practise their culinary skills.The food will then be given to students along with heating instructions so they can be taken home to eat, according to the university.Meals will need to be booked in advance.It follows the success of a similar scheme launched by the university's School of Education, Languages and Linguistics in 2023.Prof Stephen Corbett, executive dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, said: "We all know how hard exams can be, and this, coupled with the additional burden of the cost of living, we were keen to continue to provide extra support to our students at this busy, stressful and important time of year."
