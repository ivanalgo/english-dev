Mr Whiting originally began DJing on his bike during the Covid pandemic lockdowns and quickly gained a social media following for his attention-grabbing rides.He has amassed more than 800,000 social media followers, many of whom stumbled upon him when he cycled through their home towns.Mr Whiting has already ridden through many UK towns as well as playing in Germany, Australia and Switzerland.He said: "It's important not to forget that you can bring people together doing something simple, something as simple as playing music, and that’s why I’ve been doing it for three years now."Mr Whiting said such events were particularly important as music and entertainment venues faced economic uncertainty."In these sort of time, with current politics and society and so on, it kind of prevents that free spiritedness which this brings."It's open to everybody as well and I think that’s the main thing, not restricting your audience, because obviously in clubs you have to be above 18 years old."It just sort of brings back the free raving feel and the power we have as people."
