A £9.27m shared workspace designed for start-up tech companies has opened in Cheltenham.Dozens of people attended the opening of the 20,000 sq ft Minster Exchange (MX), which is a key part of Cheltenham Borough Council's cyber vision for the town, on Wednesday.The MX also has a cafe and a 200-seat auditorium for events and education, while the external Minster Gardens area features new greenery, seating and pathways.Council leader Rowena Hay said: “After a much-anticipated wait, I am delighted that the MX is now officially open."
Ms Hay said the new building would complement the Golden Valley development which will be built on land next to GCHQ and aim to confirm Cheltenham as the UK's cyber capital.She said MX's location with the Wilson Art Gallery and Cheltenham Public Library on one side and the high street on the other will breathe new life into that part of the town, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service."This innovative new space will be a place for start-ups, academia, industry and government, particularly through its links into Golden Valley, and it will also be a hub for the community, with a café and events space.“The MX will reinvigorate this area of town," Ms Hay added.
Bruce Gregory, managing director at Hub8 by Plexal, which worked with the council on the project, said MX had already welcomed 60 businesses.“These companies are working on everything from cyber security and marketing, through to recruitment and food tech," he said.“We look forward to welcoming plenty of families – many of which may well have the next bright leaders to join our innovation community in the future.”
