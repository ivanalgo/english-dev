The force appealed for anyone with any information about the 64-year-old's death to come forward. 
Det Ch Insp Gina Brennard said officers were beginning to build a timeline of events leading up to Mr McDwyer's death at the house in Platt Lane.She said: â€œA number of lines of enquiry are being looked into, but we ask that anyone with information comes forward to speak to us. "Regardless of how small you think it seems, to us, this may be the missing piece of information we need to progress this investigation. "We know that someone, somewhere, will know what has happened to him."The force said a public portal had been set up for people to submit potentially relevant CCTV, dashcam, doorbell camera or phone footage.
