A woman who found a family photo album from the 1970s in a bundle of secondhand items is trying to trace its owners. Carly Young and her partner found the album - containing wedding and baby pictures -  among items bought online from a clearance firm selling belongings from a house in Stoke-on-Trent.“We knew we couldn't get rid of it - it was too sentimental for someone out there,” said Ms Young, from Nuneaton in Warwickshire.The album contains an order of service leaflet and photos, showing the wedding of a couple called Janet and Peter at St Mary's Church in Wistaston, Cheshire, on 15 September 1979.
The album also contains baby photos and a picture of a red-haired girl playing with a Christmas cracker.“I've got two little ones and, if I had these kinds of pictures of them, I'd want them forever,” Ms Young, a mother of two, told BBC Midlands Today.
The couple bought the bundle two years ago but they only spotted the album recently, while doing a spring clear-out.Because of the time passed, Ms Young could no longer find the details of the company that sold her the bundle.She posted on a Facebook group for Stoke residents earlier this month, to ask for help with finding the album’s owner, and her post has been shared almost 250 times.
The album also contains a photo of three men with the caption "Three Musketeers D’Artagan Rolls Royce", as well as pictures of a dog called Petra and its kennel club registration card.Ms Young hopes someone from the family will contact them.“I think there's a good chance that Janet may have passed, but there's a lot of people in this [album] that may still be with us,” she said.“Maybe the little girl that's in the picture might recognise herself.”
