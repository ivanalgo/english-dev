The grave of a "hero of Corsham" who fought in the Charge of the Light Brigade will be restored in his honour.Cavalryman, Captain Daniel Clutterbuck, of the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars, took part in the 1854 offensive in the Crimean War, during which he was injured, but survived.He is buried alongside his wife at St Bartholomew's Church in Corsham, Wiltshire, where his grave had become overgrown and hidden.It will now be restored by Tidworth based The Queen's Royal Hussars, after it was rediscovered by locals.
Local historian and author, Julian Carosi, and veteran, Paul Frowde, found the grave following a tip off from a local teacher."It had been hidden for years and no one even knew it was there," Mr Carosi said."It was fantastic to find that link back to history."[Captain Clutterbuck was] one of our heroes of Corsham." 
Despite being wounded by shrapnel during the charge, Captain Clutterbuck survived and made it back home.He was married to a woman called Sofia for 50-years and had nine children.They were buried at St Bartholomew's Church in 1906.
Mr Frowde, who volunteers at the REME Museum, researched Captain Clutterbuck and discovered he was a member of the King's Royal Irish Hussars, now the Queen's Royal Hussars.After contacting the regiment, they agreed to fund and carry out the renovation.Warrant Officer Class 1, Craig Davis, the Regimental Sergeant Major of The Queenâ€™s Royal Hussars, said: "It's immensely important to us (QRH) to look after our people, current soldiers but also remember the ones that have fallen and in this instance, Captain Daniel Clutterbuck."It's the right thing to do."
Soldiers from the QRH will visit the site to clear weeds and renovate the grave whilst the trustees of the regiment have funded a new plaque.The project is expected to be completed by the Autumn when a service at the grave will be held."Taking that time to do the service gives you the moment to reflect on all the wars that we've fought in," said WO1 Davis."It touches your heart knowing that we're all one team."Mr Carosi added: "He'll be remembered, as he should be remembered."
