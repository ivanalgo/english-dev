A union representing teachers at three middle schools striking in response to possible job losses has described talks as "heading in the right direction".Glendale, Tweedmouth and Berwick middle schools in Northumberland are to close as part of proposed changes in the Berwick Partnership, with the potential loss of 50 to 60 jobs.Teachers’ union NASUWT had argued Northumberland County Council "failed to honour" its pledge to protect staff from redundancy, but say the most recent talks have been "a lot more positive".The council says it is working hard to recruit middle school staff into the new school structures and to limit job losses. 
Industrial action began with a walkout last Thursday, with another strike planned for Thursday and a further three days next week, on 18, 19 and 20 June.But John Hall, from NASUWT, said talks had been "constructive" regarding the possibility of staff being redeployed, or able to take voluntary redundancy or early retirement. "We are going ahead with this week's strike but with a further meeting on Thursday, we are really hoping we might be able to suspend the three days of strikes planned for next week," he said. "We've still got a long way to go, but we were fairly pleased with the outcome of the meeting."
A spokesperson for Northumberland County Council, said: "We are committed to investing over £41m in first-class facilities for schools in the Berwick School Partnership. "Staff have been consulted throughout this process with 18 meetings and drop in events.  "We continue our positive consultations with unions which have been ongoing for several months and hope these discussions will provide a positive outcome."
