The Eric Morecambe statue on the seafront in Morecambe is still a big attraction for visitors after a quarter of a century, a businessman has said.Unveiled by the Queen in 1999, it shows Eric in one of his characteristic poses, with a pair of binoculars around his neck.Vice chairman of the town's Business Improvement District, Tony Vetesse said it has become "part of Morecambe's history".Mr Vetesse said people come to the town to have their photo taken next to the statue, mimicking the pose.
Thousands of fans lined the promenade in the comic's hometown of Morecambe to watch the unveiling of the larger than life-sized bronze figure on 23 July 1999.The statue features some of Eric's famous sayings - and the names of 103 celebrities who starred alongside him and took sculptor Graham Ibbeson six years to complete.Mr Vetesse, who watched the unveiling through binoculars from his bookshop, said: "There was a huge amount of people, the place was absolutely swarming."He said it was "interesting, exciting, putting Morecambe on the map"."It's part of Morecambe's history," he said. "When you've got a star this big as Eric Morecambe was, taking the name of the town, who was on television weekly, it was a focal point for Morecambe. The more you mention a place, the better it gets."
The much-loved comedian - who with Ernie Wise formed the nation's favourite double act - died on 28 May 1984, after collapsing on stage with a heart attack shortly after his 58th birthday.His son, Gary Morecambe, said: "The fact the Queen and Prince Philip were there to unveil a statue to my dad was remarkable."It was very exciting."I love going to the statue and just watching the people, and sometimes talking to them, and we have a great chat and I love that."
