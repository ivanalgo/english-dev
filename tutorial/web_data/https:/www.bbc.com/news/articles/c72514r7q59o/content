Twenty-two teenagers were taken to hospital, including a 17-year-old girl who later died, during a drum and bass event, papers have shown.The teenager who died in hospital of a suspected MDMA overdose after attending the Worried About Henry gig at Dreamland, Margate, on 29 June, has been named locally as Emily Stokes.Thanet District Council’s licensing sub-committee has agreed a series of interim measures ahead of a licence review after Kent Police declared a major incident. Dreamland, which previously said it was working closely with police, has been contacted for a comment. 
One person remains in hospital in a medically-induced coma, papers submitted to the council revealed.The application by an unnamed Kent Police superintendent reveals how the force declared a major incident after a number of people under 18 were taken to hospital, with the youngest aged 15.
The report said 6,300 tickets had been sold in advance for the over-16s event which started at 1300 BST, with a further 700 tickets sold on the door.At 1700 BST, a man was found with suspected illegal drugs and arrested.An hour later, an ambulance was called for a 17-year-old boy suffering from side effects of drugs.At 1900 BST, police declared a major incident. The report said at that point officers were aware of 11 people being taken to hospital.
The application, which described the venue as well-run and well-suited to lower-risk events, said: “At this stage, we are not seeking a full revocation of the licence as Kent Police are confident in working with Dreamland prior to any review hearing.”Papers revealed officers decided not to shut down the event because this “would likely have caused a large-scale public order incident”.The superintendent said: “Allowing the event to continue would assist in the identification/support of any further casualties.”
Since the incident, Dreamland has cancelled a similar event scheduled for 27 July.Interim measures agreed on 9 July included cancelling all drum and bass events plus events deemed to be higher risk, more security staff, zero tolerance signage, and for under-18s to be accompanied by adults over 25.After the teenager’s death, a Dreamland spokesman said: “Our thoughts and prayers are with the young woman’s family and friends and we will continue to work closely with Kent Police where relevant as they investigate this tragedy further.“The police investigation is still ongoing, and we will therefore not be making any further comment.”
