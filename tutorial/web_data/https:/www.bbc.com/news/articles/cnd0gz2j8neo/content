Wiltshire Council has launched a public consultation on new proposals to combat increased anti-social behaviour in Devizes.The council is looking to introduce a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) designed to prohibit drinking of alcohol or having open containers in public.The order would also enable police to disperse groups of people if their behaviour is causing alarm.If approved, it would cover Devizes town centre and Green Lane.Residents and business owners have until 25 August to comment on the proposals.
Wiltshire Council say the plans follow an increase in incidents of large groups harassing people in the town.Cllr Dominic Muns, Cabinet Member for Environment, said: "As per our Business Plan, we want our residents to know that we take issues such as this seriously and that we are keen for Wiltshire to be a place where people can feel safe."Following feedback from Wiltshire Police, parish councils and local residents about anti-social behaviour in the town, and the introduction of similar PSPOs in Downton and Salisbury, we now feel it is an appropriate time to consider the introduction of one for Devizes."
Wiltshire Police supports the plan, saying it will help officers deal with disruptive anti-social behaviour.If successful, the order would enable police officers to seize any alcohol found on a person in the specified areas, and order groups of two or more people to move on and not return for 48 hours. Anyone found in breach of the order could be issued with a Fixed Penalty Notice of Â£100.Insp Chris Wickham said: "A Public Spaces Protection Order would assist the police greatly in dealing with anti-social behaviour and the issues associated with street drinking. "It would be a valuable tool in the toolbox of legislation open to officers dealing with behaviour in Devizes, which currently disrupts people going about their normal business and enjoying the town."Members of public are being invited to consider these proposals and provide feedback in a consultation which will run for six weeks until 25 August.
