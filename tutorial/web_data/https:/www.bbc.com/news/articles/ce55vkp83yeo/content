A man who tried to protect his one-year-old granddaughter during a dog attack has lost his thumb, police said.South Yorkshire Police were called to Mexborough, near Doncaster, just before 09:00 BST on Friday to reports the seven-year-old spaniel had become aggressive towards a baby.The child's grandfather, who tried to intervene, had his thumb bitten off by the animal, police said, while the baby suffered head wounds.Both were taken to hospital and the dog was put down.
South Yorkshire Police's Ch Insp Emma Cheney said the incident was one of 36 calls the force received related to dogs over the weekend.“This incident highlights that any dog has the ability to cause harm and injury, no matter its breed.“Dangerous dogs are continuing to place demand on our force and we’re urging owners to take precaution to reduce risk and injury."Since the start of the year, South Yorkshire Police has seized more than 300 dogs, most often because the animals were deemed dangerous, out of control or suspected to be a banned breed, Ch Insp Cheney said.“Emergency calls for dangerous dogs present a financial cost for the force every time we respond.“In addition to the cost, the hours in attendance and investigating takes valuable officers’ time away from the front line, as well as adding further pressure to our NHS colleagues through hospital admissions and care," she added.
