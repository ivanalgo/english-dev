A trio of rare piglets have been born at a conservation zoo.Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire said Visayan warty pigs, usually found on islands in the Philippines, are among the rarest species in the world.They were once found in six of the Visayan Islands but are now only on two after  deforestation in the 1970s and 1980s reduced their habitat.Zookeeper Gracie Gee said the zoo's breeding programme ensured "there’s a back-up population should wild reintroductions be considered the best action."
Sow Tessa carried the triplets for three months, three weeks and three days exactly, the zoo said.
"The pigs – now considered one of the world’s rarest species – are part of a conservation breeding programme which will help to boost the numbers of these animals, in a safe and protected environment," Ms Gee said.The piglets have a distinctive stripe pattern on their orange-coloured backs, which protects them from predators by helping blend in with the forest floor.Whipsnade said the animals would develop an adult colouration and mohawk hairstyles over the next year.
