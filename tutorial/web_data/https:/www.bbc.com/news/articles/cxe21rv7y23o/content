Players and staff have lined the route around a football stadium to pay tribute to its former chairman and co-owner on the day of his funeral. The cortege of Andrew Jenkins passed round Carlisle United's Brunton Park home before a church service in his home village of Wetheral.Mr Jenkins became chairman in the 1990s and held that role until November 2023 when Carlisle United were taken over by the current owners.The club's ticket office, admin offices and Blues Store were closed as a mark of respect and to allow staff to attend the funeral.
Mr Jenkins first joined the club's board in 1959 and in 2023 he was given the honorary title of chairman emeritus in recognition of his contribution to the club.The East Stand at Brunton Park was also renamed the Andrew Jenkins Stand.When his death was announced earlier this month aged 87, a Carlisle United statement said: "There  simply aren't enough words to explain the impact Andrew had on this football club over his 64-year association."
Matt Spooner from the Carlisle United Supporters Trust was among the fans paying tribute. "I've never known a time in my life when he hasn't been part of the club and there are no words to express what he meant to Carlisle United and to the city," he said.  "There are hundreds or even thousands of people who worked for him either at the club or at his business, Pioneer Foods, it's just a horrible loss."Carlisle United will also pay tribute to Mr Jenkins ahead of its first home  league game of the season against Barrow on 17 August.
