An "affectionate" dog as big as a baby elephant has been struggling to find a new home because he is so nervous.Milo, a Great Dane, weighs 53kg (117lb) and stands at 1m (3ft 3in) tall. The four-year-old was rescued by the RSPCA almost a year ago over welfare concerns. Senior kennel assistant Lucy Calver, from the charity's Suffolk Central Branch, said the team was "desperate" to find him a forever home. 
In March 2023 Milo was rescued by inspectors after he was found living in unsuitable conditions.RSPCA staff at the Martlesham centre say his anxiety has made it tough to find the right home for him."Milo hasn’t had the best start in life and he was terrified of everyone and everything when he arrived here," said Ms Calver. She said staff had been working with him and he had gained in confidence, but was still worried by loud sounds, bad weather, new environments and new people.
“We all love Milo so much. He’s our big friendly giant, but we want so much more for him so we’re desperate to find him a home where he can flourish," she added.Milo eats 660g (23oz) of food a day and is taller than most of the RSPCA staff when he stands on his hind legs.He has been prescribed medication by vets in a bid to help with his anxiety.Staff are looking for a quiet home in a rural setting with a secure private garden where he can be slowly and positively exposed to the outside.He cannot live with other pets but could live with older children who understand they cannot frighten him.
