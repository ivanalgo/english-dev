Space scientists at the University of Aberdeen are building technology which could produce liquid water on Mars for the very first time.The device, known as HABIT, will measure key conditions on the Red Planet during a Japanese-led mission which is expected to start in 2028.It is part of ongoing efforts to explore the habitability of Mars.A special Martian Chamber - about the size of a fridge - will be built at the university as part of preparations for the experiment.
The chamber will simulate atmospheric conditions on the planet in the laboratory. The university has been awarded Â£320,000 by the UK Space Agency for the work.Prof Javier Martin-Torres, of the university's planetary sciences group, said they hoped to enhance understanding of Mars' habitability with the project.
