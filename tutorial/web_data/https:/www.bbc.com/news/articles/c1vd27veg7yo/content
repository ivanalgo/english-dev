Amazon Prime Video has purchased a UK film studio which has been creating films for more than 70 years.The US-based company has filmed at Bray Studios in Berkshire since 2022 but has now bought the site.It means Amazon will become a more permanent feature in the area and provide a boost to the local economy.Lesley-Anne Macfarlane, head of production at Resource Productions, which runs the Berkshire Film Office said it "brings a lot more opportunities and exciting things to the area".
Her non-profit organisation helps to get productions made in the area.She said: "It shows an investment in the people and the community and the area."Ms Macfarlane believes Amazon's presence in the region is only going to grow over the next few years and become more expansive.
Bray Film Studios, located on the bank of the River Thames, is just 26 miles (42km) from central London.An 18th Century former English country house sits at the heart of the studios.The studios were the home of Hammer Films which moved there in 1951.Over two decades, Hammer created more than 100 distinctive fantasy and horror films. Films such as The Mummy, The Curse of Frankenstein and Dracula became global box-office hits starring actors including the late Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.Ridley Scott built and shot the miniatures for his Academy Award winning sci-fi thriller, Alien, at the studios in 1978 and a few years before, in 1974, the cult classic, The Rocky Horror Picture Show was brought to life there.
Amazon worked on some of the video service's biggest hits, over the past two years at Bray Studios.Titles like Rings of Power, which is a Lord of Rings spin-off show, and the first season of Citadel.“With Bray as our creative home in the UK, we are committed to deepening our relationships with the UK creative community, which is rich with world-class storytellers and creative talent of all kinds,” said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.  He added: “The acquisition of a studio with such a storied heritage not only empowers us to produce more film and television in the UK, but also unveils a wealth of opportunities in the local community with respect to jobs and skills training at all levels of the production process.”
