A teacher has received a guard of honour from colleagues as he retired after 51 years at the same school. Kevin Townsend from Salford, Greater Manchester, spent 40 years as a teacher and 11 as a teaching assistant at Buile Hill Academy, also in Salford. The 75-year-old said he was retiring to spend more time with his family and see the world. He was given a big send off by pupils and staff, but said he had not ruled out returning to the classroom.
