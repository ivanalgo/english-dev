Information sessions for home-based carers in Guernsey will be available for islanders from June, the government has said. Guernsey's Health and Social Care Committee has invited people who are informal carers - caring for loved ones at home, an informal setting - to the sessions in the Bordeaux Room at Castel Hospital. The sessions were being made available in collaboration with members of the third sector - voluntary and charitable groups - and their aim was to provide knowledge and skills to help people in caring roles, organisers said. The first session will be on 21 June, and they are due to take place monthly until next April.
