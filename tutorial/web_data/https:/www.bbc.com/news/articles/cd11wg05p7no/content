The first week of June in Scotland has been marked by chilly temperatures - and a dusting of snow on the highest mountains.But why is it so cold, and when might it warm up?
"The reason is because we have been drawing our air all the way from Greenland down across Iceland then feeding in over Scotland," says BBC Scotland weather presenter Judith Ralston. "This has now been the case for the first week of June. "The reason for this is because we have a stuck weather pattern at the moment caused by high pressure in the Atlantic and low pressure over Scandinavia which has resulted in a consistent feed of air coming in from the cold north or north-west."Judith adds: "This has resulted in coverings of snow across the mountains of Scotland, which in itself is not unusual for June, but to see seven consecutive days of snow falling over the highest peaks is very unusual."
Overnight temperatures in towns and cities at times last week dropped to between 3C and 6C.But the wind chill factor, what the Met Office describes as the "feels like" temperature,  made it feel much colder high up on Scotland's mountains.The Mountain Weather Information Service forecast warned of a wind chill of -10C.Scottish weather forecaster Kirsty McCabe says there could be a touch of overnight frost in sheltered spots this week.
The US singer Taylor Swift reportedly wore gloves during her performance at Murrayfield Stadium on Saturday because she was feeling the cold.Swift - whose hits include Cruel Summer, Love Story - and Cardigan - performed three sold-out gigs in the capital over the weekend.Saturday's weather had a bigger impact on Scottish Hill Runners' Two Mamores race in the Highlands.Bad weather forced organisers to remove the route's two mountain summit sections. Participants were also encouraged to take with them a long-sleeved extra layer of clothing.The chilly June weather has also meant some people sticking on the heating at home, at a time it would typically be off until at least September.
Is this ever going to end?.Well, there's some better news in the forecast - eventually.Forecaster Judith Ralston explains: "More of the same to come over the next few days, the change takes place later this week as the winds becoming more southerly, finally cutting of that cold air during Thursday."
