An "inspirational" man who became known for his range of Adidas trainers and charity fundraising has had a stretch of road named after him in his home town.Part of Knott Street near Darwen Youth Centre in Lancashire has been renamed Gary Aspden Way.Mr Aspden has held exhibitions in the Blackburn with Darwen area, two with his Adidas SPEZIAL brand and one for C.P. Company, with all proceeds going to local homeless charity Nightsafe.His friend, former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, also performed a special gig in Blackburn in 2022 to raise funds for the shelter.
The official unveiling of Gary Aspden Way was marked with a ceremony at Darwen Library.Mr Aspden said: "It really does feel fitting that it's this stretch of Knott Street with the youth centre on that should be re-named Gary Aspden Way."As a teenager in the 1980s, I used to go to the youth centre and in 1990 I had a job there as a trainee youth worker."He added: "Back then I had a lot of personal struggles going on and I lost that job as a result."I have a lot of history with that particular stretch."Anyone who knows me, knows just how much I care about Darwen, and Blackburn too."Blackburn with Darwen Council leader, Phil Riley, said Mr Aspden inspired young people "so it feels incredibly fitting his road should be where the youth centre is"."Gary really does have a story that should inspire us all – a young lad from Darwen who overcame his struggles and went on to develop his own global Adidas line."Jan Larkin from Nightsafe described Mr Aspden as "the nicest, kindest, most creative, and talented person I have ever met".She added: "The difference you have made to Nightsafe and the young people we help to support is just incredible."
