Two soldiers who were killed more than a century ago in World War One have finally been laid to rest.Gunner Charles Lightfoot and Sgt John Smith died two months into the war.They were killed during the Battle of Aisne in France in September 1914 but their bodies were not found until 15 year ago.Gunner Lightfoot's granddaughter Sue Kruk travelled to France from her home in Hayling Island, Hampshire, for the military burial ceremony in their honour.
In 2009, French historian Jerome Buttet was researching war graffiti in a cave near Chassemy, when he discovered a makeshift grave with an inscription.It read: "15 Sept 1914, Here lies Sjt Smith and 3 Gnrs, 29th Battery RFA."Mr Buttet brought in archaeologists, who discovered two sets of remains in the cave.Ministry of Defence (MoD) detectives at Imjin Barracks in Gloucestershire carried out research and DNA testing, which allowed them to identify the two fallen men as Sgt Smith from Gloucestershire and Gunner Lightfoot from Edinburgh.Both served with the 29th Battery of Royal Field Artillery.
Ms Kruk still has a box of her grandmother Netty Lightfoot's belongings. Among the items she kept was a letter dated 18 October 1914, more than a month after Gunner Lightfoot was killed.It read: "It is my painful duty to inform you that a report has this day been received from the war office, notifying the death of Gunner Charles Lightfoot."The cause of death was killed in action."Mrs Lightfoot was pregnant when her husband left for France."It was so difficult for women in World War One," said Ms Kruk."A whole generation of men went, and that was ghastly, and then a whole generation of women had to deal with the loss."
Both soldiers were buried with full military honours at the Commonwealth War Graves Commissionâ€™s Vendresse British Cemetery in France on 13 June.Ms Kruk said of the service: "I think it's the end of a chapter and it's a lovely end to it after such sadness."
