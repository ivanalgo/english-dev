A woman who fell ill after a severe allergic reaction said a lifeboat crew had to help her breathe because the hospital a few hundred yards away was closed.Eilidh Beaton fell ill having been at a festival in Portree, Skye, on Saturday. She said some of those who went to her aid "banged" on the locked door of the town's hospital to try and get assistance.That night a 49-year-old woman died after taking unwell at the same festival, prompting Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes to call for an investigation into emergency medical provision in north Skye.Ms Beaton said RNLI volunteers gave her oxygen from their boat, which was anchored in the nearby bay, until an ambulance arrived 45 minutes later. 
At weekends, Portree Community Hospital is available for urgent care non-emergency care by appointment from 08:30 to 19:30. NHS Highland said emergency care was available by contacting 999, and the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) responded to Saturday's two incidents.The health board said there were staff in the hospital caring for inpatients, and they had provided an oxygen mask to a member of the public as soon as they became aware of the request for one.It said the hospital was locked for safety and security during out-of-hours and said overnight staff were not in a position to provide urgent care.A spokeswoman said NHS Highland would be liaising with SAS as part of its investigations of what happened at the weekend, and "take forward any learning for both organisations."Six years ago, a review recommended there should be access to urgent care 24 hours a day, all week. The review said in emergencies, people should dial 999.
Ms Beaton was attending the Skye Live music festival and had left the venue to go to a pub to meet friends.She told BBC Naidheachdan: "When I got into the pub I wasn't feeling very well and I was sick and started getting hives on my arm." Her partner used the emergency treatment she carried in case of an allergic reaction. An ambulance was also called.Ms Beaton said a passing coastguard vehicle was flagged down.The coastguard volunteers contacted Portree lifeboat crew, who arrived with some medical equipment. One of the RNLI team was an advanced nursing practitioner (ANP).Ms Beaton said: "They needed equipment they didn't have, so one of the coastguard volunteers ran up to the hospital to get it."He was banging on the door and no-one was coming."Oxygen was then retrieved from the RNLI crews' lifeboat, but the volunteers did not have the mask needed.Ms Beaton said her partner then tried to get help at hospital, but again without success.She claimed a mask eventually arrived from the hospital after a phone call was made by the ambulance crew sent to her aid.
Ms Beaton, who is among north Skye residents who have been campaigning for an upgrade in medical services, said the quick reactions of coastguard and RNLI volunteers saved her life.She said: "If none of them had been there, there's not much chance I would be here to be honest."Ms Beaton said her situation showed there was a need for improved access to out-of-hours urgent care.She said the community had been shocked by the death of the 49-year-old woman, who had been attending Skye Live.On Monday, Ms Forbes said she was "hugely concerned" by reports that emergency access to Portree Community Hospital was limited on Saturday.She said she had asked NHS Highland to investigate medical provision in north Skye, and had raised the weekend's incident with SAS and Health Secretary Neil Gray.
NHS Highland said emergency services responded to Saturday's incidents.A spokeswoman said: "The Scottish Ambulance Service responded to both incidents, with support from an off-duty ANP on site and a doctor from the Broadford Hospital accident and emergency department attended. "For one of the incidents, an oxygen mask was secured from Portree hospital to support with the ongoing treatment. "Due to patient confidentiality, it would be inappropriate for us to make further comment."The Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) said all 999 calls were triaged to ensure it prioritised patients with life-threatening conditions.
