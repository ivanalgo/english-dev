A Manx festival aims to "inspire the community to engage with literature in all of its forms", an organiser has said.The 11th annual Manx Litfest will run from 24 to 29 September, and will see a number of events hosted featuring poetry, illustration, storytelling and writing.Events will be held at a variety of venues by both visiting and local individuals, with  novelist, stand-up comedian, actress and playwright Sukh Ojla as the headline act.Festival director Helen Jessopp said the week of events aimed to create a "literature based community" and encourage individuals to "get into reading, writing and poetry".
The 2024 lineup includes a "wide range of visitors to cover a myriad of genres", making sure there was "something for everyone", Ms Jessopp continued.Events include poetry nights, a writers' day and book fanatics' quiz night, as well as events held by visiting and local authors, illustrators and poets.Ms Jessopp said she was most looking forward to a crime and rhyme night, which would have two crime writers talking about their books followed by a performance by The Bookshop Band, who have a repertoire of book-themed songs.There will also be a number of school visits and library events with children's authors and illustrators."The most important thing for us is that we are providing opportunities to young people," Ms Jessopp said.It was important to have free school visits from "local and visiting artists"  to show there were Isle of Man-based professionals in literature, as well as providing the opportunity to meet visiting professionals, she said."We are trying to get out and reach as many in the community and inspire them to engage with literature in all of its forms," she added.
