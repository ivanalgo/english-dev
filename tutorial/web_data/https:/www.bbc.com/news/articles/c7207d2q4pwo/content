Organisers of a skateboard festival say this year's event could be its last ever, as they struggle to find volunteers.Playing host to BMX, skateboard and scooter competitions, the 21st Nailsea Community Skate Park Festival is taking place at Millennium Park.Event founder Phil Williams said he was "proud" to see the festival grow.However, he needs new volunteers so "a younger crew can take it on".
He said: "I want to thank all of those who have faithfully given up their time to help myself as we have run this event, and very much hope that other people will now get alongside this, and turn it into something equally as exciting."The festival has been supported by a number of community groups, including Holy Trinity and Trendlewood churches, Nailsea Town Council, Nailsea community trust, Christians together in Nailsea and North Somerset Council.Attendees to the festival will be able to take part in activities and enjoy a BBQ.Anyone who has an interest in taking over the festival is encouraged to contact Mr Williams.
