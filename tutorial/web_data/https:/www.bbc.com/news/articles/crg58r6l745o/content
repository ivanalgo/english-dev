First World War practice trenches that were lost beneath heathland for decades have been granted heritage protection by the government.The rare site in Browndown in Gosport, Hampshire, was used for training troops between 1914 - 1918.The practice battlefield was rediscovered in 2011 after it was spotted in an old aerial photo of the area.Following advice from Historic England, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), it has been designated as a scheduled monument.
The two sets of opposing trench systems, with a no man's land between them, were found after a council employee uncovered a photograph of the area, taken in 1951.Hidden for years by bracken and gorse, Rob Harper described his discovery as "jaw-dropping".Recruits would have used the site to learn how to dig, reinforce, repair and adapt the trenches, as well as how to live and fight in them.The system of trenches is considered to be one of England’s best preserved and most complex examples of its type, according to Historic England.
Simulating a battlefield, the trenches were built to mimic sections of the Western Front.Historic England said it was likely that the Royal Marines Light Infantry and the Hampshire Regiment trained at Browndown before leaving for the Front via Southampton.Open to the public, the trenches are situated on Ministry of Defence land south of Alver Valley Country Park.The move follows an in-depth review by Historic England of Gosport’s unique military heritage as part of the Gosport Heritage Action Zone.
