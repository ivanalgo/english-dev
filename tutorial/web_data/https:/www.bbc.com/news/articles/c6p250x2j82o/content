A new advisory board to help with the management and conservation of the Isle of Man's recreational fisheries has been created.The Isle of Man Recreational Fisheries Management Board will be responsible for making recommendations about the river and stream networks, reservoirs and coastal habitats.The establishment of the new body has meant the disbanding of the former Manx Anglers Forum, which previously communicated with the fishing community.Environment, Food and Agriculture Minister Clare Barber said the new board would support "informed" decision making.
Membership comprises those with knowledge of commercial and recreational fishing, retailing of fish products, experience in public administration and a scientific background.
The line-up aims to include eight "active recreational fishermen that have expertise in fisheries covering a range of species and angling techniques", two representing commercial stakeholders, and a further two with scientific expertise.The Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture is still seeking expressions of interest in joining the board, with the application process open until the end of July.The initial focus of the body will be the use of the hatchery at Cornaa and the restocking of river in relation to Atlantic salmon, reforms to freshwater angling licences, and enhancing fish migration in the island's inland waterways.Ms Barber said forming the group was a "significant step towards ensuring the long-term health and vitality of our aquatic ecosystems and a more sustainable future for our prized fishing spots"."The board will play an important role and support informed decisions that benefit both our biosphere and the fishing community to deliver an environment we can be proud of," she added.
