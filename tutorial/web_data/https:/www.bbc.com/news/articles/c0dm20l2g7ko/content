Broadcaster and former racing driver Billy Monger has announced his next extreme challenge to raise funds for Comic Relief.He is hoping to become the youngest double amputee to complete the annual Ironman World Championship in Hawaii in October.  The 25-year-old, from Charlwood, Surrey, raised more than £3m for the charity in 2021 by walking, cycling and kayaking across England over four days.He said his latest challenge was "going to push me to my physical and mental breaking points".
Mr Monger had both legs amputated after a near-fatal crash in 2017.
The Ironman will see Mr Monger swim, cycle and run a combined total of 140.6 miles (226km) in a single day.Mr Monger, who has been training for the event since last October, said: "It's like nothing I've ever done before. I’ve never run a marathon, never tried to cycle 112 miles or swam in the ocean. "Add the heat and humidity of Hawaii to it all and there’s just so many factors to deal with."I know this is going to take every single bit of effort that I’ve got in me to get it done."Competitors are required to finish in 17 hours.  Mr Monger hopes to break the world championship record for a double amputee - 16 hours and 27 minutes. His journey will be filmed as part of a documentary, airing on BBC One and iPlayer.He added: "With every mile I cover, I’m hoping to raise as much as I can for those who need it most."
