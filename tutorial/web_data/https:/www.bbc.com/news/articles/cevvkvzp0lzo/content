More than 500 workers at the Dounreay nuclear site have gone on strike in a dispute over pay.Unite and GMB members have walked out after rejecting a revised offer from Nuclear Restoration Services (NRS) made earlier this month.Prospect union members accepted the deal after previously being involved in the dispute at the complex near Thurso.Unite and GMB are planning a further 24-hour strike on 19 June.
The revised offer proposed a one-off Â£500 payment on top of a basic 4.5% increase.NRS said it was committed to finding a "fair and affordable" resolution.Unite said the offer amounted to a substantial pay cut due to rates of inflation.Lesley-Anne MacAskill, GMB Scotland organiser in the Highlands, said: "This dispute has unfolded in slow motion over more than a year and could have been averted if managers had seriously engaged with the negotiations."
