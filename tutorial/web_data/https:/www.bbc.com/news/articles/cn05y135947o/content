A consultation on plans to charge drivers for using the Blackwall and Silvertown tunnels has been launched by Transport for London (TfL).Charges are due to be introduced for both routes once the Silvertown Tunnel opens in spring 2025, with drivers having to pay to use the tunnels between 06:00 and 22:00, seven days a week.Under TfL's proposals, driving cars and small vans through either of the tunnels at peak times would cost £4, with a £2.50 charge for motorbikes.TfL said without the charges "there would likely be high levels of traffic and congestion, which would lead to detrimental air quality impacts and longer journey times".
Peak times would apply from 06:00 to 10:00 northbound and 16:00 to 19:00 southbound from Monday to Friday under TfL's plans.The off-peak rate would be £1.50 for cars, motorbikes and small vans, when paying by Auto Pay.Large vans would be charged £2.50 during off-peak times and £6.50 in peak times, and HGVs would be charged £5 in off-peak times and £10 in peak hours, when paying by Auto Pay.Any drivers not using Auto Pay would be charged the peak amount at any time, TfL said.
The transport body said there would be a "green and fair package" of concessions and discounts for Londoners and businesses.It added that exemptions would apply for: taxis and blue badge holders; zero-emission capable and wheelchair-accessible private hire vehicles registered with TfL; and DVLA-registered minibuses and coaches.Exemptions would also apply to staff and patients eligible for the NHS reimbursement scheme.And there would be a 50% charge discount for people on low incomes across east and south-east London, as well as free cross-river bus, cycle shuttle and DLR travel for them for at least one year, TfL said.
The transport body said that the close proximity of the two tunnels meant both routes needed to be charged to ensure traffic levels do not increase in one area as a result of drivers using an uncharged crossing.Christina Calderato, director of strategy at TfL, said: "Without introducing tunnel user charges for the Silvertown and Blackwall tunnels, there would likely be high levels of traffic and congestion, which would lead to detrimental air quality impacts, as well as longer journey times."
The consultation will last for eight weeks and plans that have been informed by the feedback will then be approved by the TfL Board.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: "The Silvertown Tunnel scheme has been years in the making, first developed back 2012. "I encourage Londoners in the area to get involved and have their say."
