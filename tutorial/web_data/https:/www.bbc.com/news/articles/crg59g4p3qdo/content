Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has announced a £2m investment package in activities which he said would divert thousands of young people away from violence over the summer holidays.The funding has been put into the mayor’s Violence Reduction Unit (VRU), and will be directed to areas of the capital most affected by crime.The package of activities ranges from sport to music production, mentoring and employment opportunities.Mr Khan said tackling violence was his "top priority" and he wanted young people "to be safe, to develop and to thrive".
Pharrell Garcia, 15, was fatally stabbed in east London last Tuesday and 15-year-old Rene Graham was shot dead in west London on 21 July. The activities aim to support the capital's young people during a time of year when evidence suggests they are more vulnerable to exploitation and violence.Research from the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime has found that violence affecting young people traditionally peaks in the summer months.Last year, eight teenagers were killed between June and August.VRU director Lib Peck said: “The summer holidays are a really important period in a young person’s life. It should be a time to explore, to have fun and to build and make friendships."We’re committed to investing in young people and giving them the opportunities they deserve because we firmly believe that violence is preventable, not inevitable.”
Some of the funding will be given to pupil referral units and alternative provision settings so that they can provide their own activities over the holidays.This includes boxing, BMX coaching, trips outside the community and opportunities to develop skills in carpentry and hair and beauty.Ekota Academy in Ilford, east London, is one of the schemes delivering funded sports opportunities such as football, basketball, cricket and cycling, as well as mentoring.Aleya Chowdhury, programme development manager at the academy, said the summer holidays were a "critical period" for young people who are "at risk of negative influences".Hackney-born rapper Professor Green, whose real name is Stephen Manderson, said "providing opportunities to take part in fun activities over the summer is key to keeping young people safe".
