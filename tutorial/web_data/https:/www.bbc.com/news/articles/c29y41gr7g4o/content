A football club has said it needs to raise £120,000 to allow it to survive until the end of the season.Marske United FC were promoted to the Northern Premier League (NPL) Premier Division for the first time in the club's history last season.But the move to the higher league has led to increased costs which cannot be  sustained, the club warned.Manager Graeme Lee said: "There are a lot of people in this moment of time trying every single thing they can to keep this club going."
In 2021-22 the team secured promotion after beating local rivals Stockton Town in a play-off.But the club has needed to find a larger playing budget while also paying out higher costs for travelling to games and paying for additional stewards.
Mr Lee said said Marske was a "small village" but the team's achievements were "immense".He said: "It’s a crying shame that we can’t sustain that."The club said it plans to change its status to a limited company, which would allow it to open a share scheme to raise money, but would not be able to do so until the end of the season as they would be unable to play during the six to weight week-long process.
In the meantime, a JustGiving page has been set up in a bid to keep the club running until the end of the season.Mr Lee said the biggest loss from the club's closure would be to the community that supports the team.He said: "There are so many people who do so many good things for this club and they bring people together from the town."It means that much to so many people."
