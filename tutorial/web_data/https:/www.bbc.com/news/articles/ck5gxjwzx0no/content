More schools have been given council accreditation for addressing the health and wellbeing of children and young people.The Wiltshire Healthy Schools scheme has 131 schools in the programme, with 80 currently awarded bronze, silver or gold. To qualify, schools submitted evidence explaining their provision and the difference their work had made to the health of their pupils.Among the 10 more schools which gained accreditation, one was also given to an MoD school based in Cyprus.
Schools that received silver and gold awards also had to show how they have added extra interventions into their usual programmes.One primary school in Salisbury found a way to ensure children felt their voices and opinions were listened to more, while a secondary school had added in sun safety lessons and engaged parents as well as students.Much of the scheme has built on the Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education that schools take part in, but Wiltshire Healthy Schools can also provide some support.Cllr Laura Mayes, Wiltshire Council's Cabinet Member for Children's Services said: “We have some amazing initiatives from schools who have taken a step back and considered what would really make a difference and these have had a positive impact on pupils and the whole school community. "I'm delighted that so many schools have received this award, and I would encourage more to come forward in the future” she added.Of the 10 schools that got accreditation this term, Fitzmaurice Primary in Bradford-on-Avon got gold and three got silver - Royal Wootton Bassett Academy,  St John’s CofE Primary School, Tisbury and Urchfont Primary School.
