A drug addict who murdered his friend to steal her jewellery, before hiding her body "like rubbish" under a sofa, has been jailed for at least 36 years.Glenna Siviter, 50, was stabbed 36 times at her home in Middlesbrough in December.Andrew Hall, 47, who was said to be like a "brother" to Ms Siviter, had denied murder but was found guilty at Newcastle Crown Court.Hall, who was also convicted of the attempted murder of a man and wounding with intent another man, was jailed for life with a minimum term.
Prosecutors said Ms Siviter was killed at her home in Grimwood Avenue in the early hours of 11 December, with her body found four days later hidden beneath her sofa.In the days between the killing and discovery of her body, Hall also stabbed two other men after taking drugs with them.
Jurors had been told Ms Siviter lived in Jersey for 20 years, but she fell back into drug use after returning to Middlesbrough.She and Hall had known each other since childhood and were "like brother and sister", Hall's partner told the trial.During the two and a half week-long trial, Peter Moulson KC said Ms Siviter was killed for her jewellery which was then sold or swapped for drugs.Hall, of Thorntree Avenue, Middlesbrough, had denied any wrongdoing but was found guilty after jurors spent a day and a half deliberating.
Ms Siviter's son, Declan, who found her body, said his whole family had been "devastated" by his mother's death, and the "disgustingly violent" attack by Hall had caused a "sickening whirlwind of emotion".He said his mum had moved to Jersey to make a "nice life for herself", but she returned to Middlesbrough in 2017 after the death of her own mother.
He said the subsequent death of a much-loved aunt led to Ms Siviter falling into drug use and "mingling with the likes of Hall".Mr Siviter said Hall's actions against a woman who knew and trusted him were "horrific and despicable", and his mum was "hidden like rubbish" beneath the sofa."Nobody should suffer such sickening acts of violence and be left to rot by someone who supposedly cared for her," Mr Siviter said, adding Hall was "clearly a very dangerous individual who could turn incredibly violent".Mr Siviter said his mum's murderer was a "lying, manipulative, sneaky little rodent of a man" who had stolen and sold Ms Siviter's belongings "just for a rock of crack".He said Hall had "shown not one bit of remorse" and implored the court to "never let this man see the light of day again".
Prosecutor Peter Moulson KC said Hall murdered Ms Siviter "for gain" and "the degree of violence was far beyond that which was necessary to achieve the defendant's ends".He added there "would have been a degree of pain and suffering before her death".Craig Woodier, who was repeatedly stabbed in his car outside his Laycock Street home by Hall on 15 December, said the attempted murder had changed his life.He said he had to wear long shirts and hoods to cover his multiple scars and he could no longer trust anyone.Judge Mr Justice Lavender said Hall, who had multiple convictions for burglary and theft, launched "unprovoked attacks" on three of his acquaintances over five days in December.He said there was "no discernible motive" but the judge was sure drugs had played a "significant role" in Hall's actions."You ended Ms Siviter's life and brought grief and misery to the lives of others," the judge told him.Hall was also jailed for 25 years for the attempted murder and five years for wounding, both to be served concurrently.
Det Ch Insp Peter Carr, from Cleveland Police’s homicide team, paid tribute to Ms Siviter's family, adding they had shown "great courage and dignity" throughout the process.He said: "Due to Hall’s denials, they have had to listen to the awful evidence in this case and hear about how Glenna was murdered in the family home."  He also thanked Hall's other victims for their bravery in attending court and "reliving their ordeals as witnesses".
