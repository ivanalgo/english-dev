A woman who lost a leg when she was hit by a New York taxi says she has become "hooked" on running.Sian Lord, 35, from Glenfield in Leicestershire, was struck while on holiday in the US in 2013.Ms Lord - who is now a motivational speaker based on her own experiences - said she hoped her case would encourage other people with disabilities to get active.She added it was the latest hurdle she had been able to overcome.
Six years after the crash she received $150,000 (£116,000) in compensation.Taxi driver Faysal Himon, who never faced criminal charges, blamed a cyclist with whom he was having an argument just before the crash.Ms Lord, who is also a social media content creator, model and mum to two girls, said she had now taken up running."For me it's meant I get that hour to myself whenever I can. It’s really nice because you know being a mum, your time isn’t just yours," she said."[The running] is hard, you do get used to it though, but I am really enjoying it and I’m getting a little bit hooked!"Next month marks 11 years since the crash, which happened while she was visiting a friend.Asked whether she would have imagined where she had got to today, she said: "Absolutely not! All the things I have in my life - I just didn’t think that was a possibility for me."She said she found her modelling "really rewarding" and she hoped her story could be an inspiration to others."I get to go into schools, colleges and speak to students about body image and self-acceptance and I absolutely love it," she said."Whatever happens to you in your life, you’re going to go through hurdles, but there’s always a way you can try to find something you love again."So I think that’s my message - you can just do anything. Put your mind to it, find the confidence and you’ll be great."Follow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
