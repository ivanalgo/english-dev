A zoo has celebrated the birth of four new endangered horse foals.Marwell, near Winchester, said it was "delighted" to welcome the arrivals to the endangered Przewalski’s horse herd.All four are female and said to be "doing well" after two were born in May and two in June.Przewalski’s horses, which come from China and Mongolia, are the last surviving sub-species of truly wild horse in the world and were extinct in the wild for almost 40 years, the zoo said.
Marwell animal keeper Erin Luter said: “All of the foals are doing well and can often be seen laying or sunbathing in the valley field close by the rest of the herd.“The first foal was born to mother, Lena, on 3 May. She’s named Xaela which means mystical or fierce in Mongolian.“The second foal was born to mother, Tsetseg, on 11 May and is named Shara after a mountain in Mongolia.”The younger two foals were born just one day apart with Bilüü arriving to mother Tuya on 12 June and Ereen born to Speranza on 13 June. Their names are both cities in Mongolia.Ms Luter added: “These horses, that were previously listed extinct in the wild, are an example of how zoo breeding programmes can help restore threatened species around the world.”
The animals were extinct in the wild between 1969 and 2008 due to hunting, cultural and political changes, climate change and military activities.All the Przewalski’s horses alive today are descended from just 12 individuals.Current estimates suggest there are 178 mature individuals living in the wild.
