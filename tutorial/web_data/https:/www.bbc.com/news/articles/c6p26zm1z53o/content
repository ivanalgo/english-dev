Stag beetle researchers have called on people across London to record any sightings to help track the insect's whereabouts and numbers.Britain's largest beetle species has been in "steep decline" across much of Europe but the capital remains a "hotspot", according to the London Wildlife Trust.The beetle, whose males have distinctive antler-like jaws, are most commonly found in west and south-west London's parks and woodlands. North and east London has seen fewer recorded sightings over the years, which the trust says remains unexplained.
The trust is asking people to report any sightings here.
Epping Forest, Richmond Park, and Wimbledon & Putney Commons are designated European Special Areas for Conservation partly for stag beetles, a London Wildlife Trust spokesperson said."Stag beetle season" began and lasts until late July, they said."The males fly clumsily with a faint clattering whirr, and are most likely to be seen on sultry summer evenings an hour or two before dusk."A trust spokesperson said the species was "globally threatened" and the count would help better map the beetles' presence in London.
