The BBC has said on-screen presenters are "regularly reminded" of its guidelines relating to clothing, after an incident in which Gary Lineker appeared to breach those rules by wearing outfits from his own fashion range.During England's opening Euros game on Sunday night, the Match of the Day host wore a green T-shirt and jacket which appeared to be from the Next range he endorses.BBC guidelines say presenters must not appear on-air wearing clothing which they have agreed to promote.Lineker has been approached for a comment, but has yet to respond.The former footballer was fronting the BBC's coverage of England's match against Serbia, which the Three Lions won 1-0.He sported a pale green knitted T-shirt, before putting on a sage green jacket at half time.Both items resembled clothing from the Next X Gary Lineker collection, which is promoted as being "edited by the legendary man himself". It has not, however, been confirmed that this was the case.The BBC said it would not comment on individual incidents.But a spokesperson added: "Presenters [and] contributors provide their own wardrobe and all presenters / contributors are regularly reminded of the guidelines in relation to clothing, even if they are not doing proactive promotional work."Lineker has been criticised in recent years for speaking out on political issues, notably the government's Rwanda policy.His comments led to a debate about impartiality rules and BBC presenters' behaviour on social media.BBC guidelines on conflicts of interest state: "Presenters or other individuals must not appear on-air wearing clothing or using products or services which they have agreed/been contracted to promote, advertise or endorse or in which they have a specific financial interest."
