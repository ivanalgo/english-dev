Deacon Blue, Callum Beattie, Bill Bailey and Twin Atlantic were among the final day acts of the 20th Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival.Saturday is traditionally the busiest of the Highland event's three days, and features a fireworks display marking the end of the festival.The day saw surprise sessions in the Tomatin Bothy bar by Salamander Street singer Beattie, accordionist and vocalist Calum MacPhail and pipers Major Blowhard and the Windbags - who played songs by Lady Gaga and from the Top Gun film.Twin Atlantic's frontman Sam McTrusty got the Garden stage crowd to help him sing some of his songs after a recent illness had affected his voice, but managed to power through the hit Heart and Soul.On Friday night, thousands of fans watched James Arthur on the main Hot House stage and there were similar numbers over at the Garden stage for Jake Bugg.
Beattie's Saturday night set included new song Something in my eye, which is dedicated to Highland-based mental health charity Mikesysline.The final day's other acts included Colonel Mustard and the Dijon Five and Lucy Spraggan.Earlier on Friday, there was some 90s nostalgia from Ocean Colour Scene - who opened their set with The Riverboat Song - and The Vaselines, who packed out the Grassroots tent and had their crowd singing along to Molly's Lips and Son of a Gun.Bella's theme this year is love and fittingly the last day features a performance by 1960s US rock band Love.About 25,000 people were expected to attend the festival over its weekend, which has featured dozens of acts and a wide range of genres from country to electronica.
Thursday's opening day featured Sugababes, Sophie Ellis-Bexter and Teenage Fanclub, while Friday saw one of the final gigs of Skye band Niteworks.On smaller stages dotted across the site there were performances by Folk'd Up and Tony Hawk's Pro Soundsystem.
Outside the music, there has been wrestling matches, stunt cyclists and a number of weddings.BBC ALBA coverage of Belladrum on its channel and also BBC iPlayer.
