The funeral for a five-year-old boy who died after falling from a block of flats has taken place at a local mosque.Aalim Makail fell from one of the upper floors of 15-storey Jacobs House in New City Road, Plaistow, at about 06:00 BST on Thursday and was pronounced dead at the scene.Police are not treating his death as suspicious but Newham Council says it is "undertaking a full investigation".Aalim was buried in the Gardens of Peace at the East London Mosque on Saturday afternoon.
A fundraising page has raised more than Â£7,500 to support his "inconsolable" family and help pay for the funeral service."We are devastated for the family and wanted to show our support at this incredibly difficult time," said the mosque leaders at Masjid Ibrahim Plaistow, who set up the fund.Aalim's school, New City Primary School,  paid tribute to a "beautiful, happy and caring child".
Meanwhile, concerns have been raised about the quality of the windows in the flats.An anonymous resident of Jacobs House described them as "poor quality".He told the BBC: "The design of the windows on high floors are not good and safe for children."You can actually unlatch the windows in the living room, kitchen and one of the bedrooms wide open which is clearly not meant to be safe. "If a latch does break, it will not close properly and it could blow wide open no matter what."Newham Council has not answered questions about the windows in Jacobs House.A spokesperson for the Building Safety Regulator, part of the Health and Safety Executive, said: "We are engaging with the appropriate agencies to understand the facts."A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said a file would be prepared for the coroner.
