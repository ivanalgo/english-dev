Bars and pubs in a market town have come together to try and make women feel safer at night.Owners and staff were given a training session at the Trowbridge Civic Centre on Tuesday aimed at making sure people are safe during the darker hours.Part of the training includes a scheme called Pubwatch which allows pubs and clubs to share information about potentially vulnerable customers.Ruby Goodman, landlady of the The Stallards Inn, said the initiative gives workers "that little bit more" to help people who do not feel safe.
The training initiative includes 10 face-to face-sessions, five online sessions and online learning.Staff will be trained to have better awareness of potential drink spiking and how to implement the ‘Ask for Angela’ scheme.
Tori Jordan, from Still Sisters Distillery, described Trowbridge as a "quiet place", but explained why it is still "intimidating" for females walking alone at night."It's a perception and a feeling," she said."I'm a keen runner, but at night time I don't go running on my own."
Antonia Cook from Trowbridge Town Hall Trust applauded the Ask For Angela scheme."It's been around for a while now, but it will be really positive," she said."It's sad that women have to feel like they're protecting themselves, but there are so many people here who are doing their bit to make people feel safe."
