Black bins will be emptied every three weeks in North Somerset, instead of fortnightly as they currently are, in a bid to reduce waste, boost recycling and cut costs. The county council unanimously agreed to make the changes - which will be introduced in phases in 2025 - in line with its recycling and waste strategy targets.The authority estimates the changes will save the local authority £1.1m a year and help fund other vital services. Other recycling and waste collections are not affected. 
The council said officers will be available to advise residents who have concerns or may need extra support with the changes, such as those with medical needs, children, or living in larger households. 
Kerbside collections of soft plastics will also be introduced. A new recycling container will be trialled over the coming months, and collection crews will be given additional training. According to the council, North Somerset households generated a total of approximately 90,000 tonnes of waste last year. Residents disposed of 40,000 tonnes in black bins - despite 18,000 tonnes of that being recyclable. Treating and disposing of waste from black bins costs tax payers about £130 per tonne, the council said.
Councillor Annemieke Waite said: “This year, we will need to spend around £5 million to dispose of black bin rubbish, but almost half of this waste could instead be recycled and generate an income to help pay for vital local services.“North Somerset residents already do a lot of hard work to recycle but it’s important we do more. "Not only will that save council tax payers’ money, it will also help protect our environment.”
