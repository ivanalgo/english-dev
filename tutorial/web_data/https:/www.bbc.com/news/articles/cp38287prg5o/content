A historic market will be granted a permanent site if plans to regenerate a town are approved.Redcar and Cleveland Council has applied for planning permission to make "public realm improvements" at the heart of market town Guisborough.If agreed, the proposals would see the return of a market site near the town's Market Cross and changes made to roads, footpaths and parking arrangements.The authority's planning agents, Lichfields, said the Levelling Up-funded proposals would "maximise Guisborough's potential as a visitor destination".
James Fryatt, senior planner and heritage consultant at Lichfields, said the plans would improve the town's environment and provide "a more diverse evening economy"."They would enhance the public realm and significantly improve accessibility and safety within the town centre, particularly for those with mobility issues," he added.Potential changes to the town were outlined in a cover letter submitted with the planning application by Mr Fryatt.In it, he suggests that the transformation will enhance the town's weekly market and support existing and future businesses by generating increased footfall and "reinforcing the centre as the heart of the community". 
The proposals include:To minimise the impact of the work being carried out, the council's environmental health team has recommended limiting construction and demolition to between 08:00 and 18:00 during the week and 08:00 to 13:00 on Saturdays.
A Heritage Impact Assessment submitted alongside the plans considers the potential impact on some of the town's historic sites. It reflects suggestions to retain existing cobblestones, whinestone setts and patterned scoria blocks where possible, "given their contribution to Guisborough as a market town". It also outlines potentially harmful aspects of the proposed improvements, including changes to the town's conservation area, such as the introduction of terracing on the north-west side of Westgate which could alter "the character and appearance of the historic streetscape".The assessment concludes that the benefits of developments "would outweigh the less than substantial harm which would result from the proposal".A public consultation into the plans, which would be funded through the second round of the government's Levelling Up Fund, will run until 23 July.
