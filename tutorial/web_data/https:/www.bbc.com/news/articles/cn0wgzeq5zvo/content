Residents in a Kent village have expressed shock and anger over a 600% price increase in local parking charges.The cost of all-day parking in the public car park in School Lane, Herne, has increased from £2.20 to £15.The parish council objected to the increase while residents claim it could affect businesses and attendance at events at the adjacent Herne Centre community hall.Canterbury City Council said: "As with all parking charges, the situation at School Lane will be reviewed next year, when we will consider what the impact of the change has been."
Since 1 April the costs of using the car park between 09:00 and 18:00 has been £1.90 per hour, but is free outside those hours.Previously, users were charged 60p for 30 minutes, £1.20 for two hours or £2.20 for 24 hours.The price increase was one of several approved by Canterbury City Council in February in a bid to raise £1m a year.Scott Davis, whose daughter runs Herne's Smugglers Inn public house, said: "She's been there 10 weeks and it's been booming, it's been thriving, picking up every week."Since the charge came in we're noticing it's tailing off lunchtimes."There's a lot of pensioners round here, they just can't afford to park for two hours and pay the extra money. It went up 600%."
Helen McNabb, who attends a dance class at the Herne Centre, said the charge increase was "extortionate".She told BBC Radio Kent: "The raise in charges is going to put people off using the car park and they’ll go to nearby streets which weren’t built for cars.”
In a statement, Canterbury City Council said: "We accept the change in approach to car park banding has resulted in an increase in prices at School Lane."But we have continued to allow free parking for the morning school run and in the evening for events at the Herne Centre."And residents are able to apply for an off-street residents' permit which offers good value for all year round parking."
