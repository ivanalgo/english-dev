A derelict former railway sidings in Birmingham is set to be transformed into a 451-home complex comprising of seven tower blocks.Plans were approved earlier this month for the Great Western Close project in Winson Green, with the buildings ranging from five to nine storeys in height.Those behind the project have said the plans will provide affordable housing, public green spaces and breathe new life into the area.A previous planning application for 310 homes was approved in 2021 but the applicant sought approval for a more intensive form of development at the site.
Gareth Hooper, chief executive officer at DPP, said: “This scheme took an existing permission and achieved a much higher density of development while also delivering a higher quality scheme with significantly more community benefits, including affordable housing.”Mark Williams, director at Whittam Cox Architects, added: “We believe these proposals will greatly complement and enhance this aspirational area of the city, providing high-quality, affordable living and ensuring a long-term sustainable use for the site.”
Many of the ground floor apartments will have private garden areas while others will feature private balconies at upper levels, according to the plans.The development will also have areas of open space for the private use of residents and a children’s play area for the wider public.Although Birmingham City Council usually requires 35% of homes in a residential development of 15 or more to be affordable homes, a report by officers said a suitable level of on-site affordable housing provision was agreed.“It has been concluded that the current offer of 6%, in the form of on-site, market discounted homes for first homes and affordable rental units, would be the option with the greatest benefit to the city,” the authority said.Officers also highlighted that 59% of the new homes proposed were two and three bedroom units – better matching housing need in the area.Landscaping and appearance will be decided at a future meeting.
