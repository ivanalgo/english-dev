Revised plans for a new 4,000-home village have been submitted to North Yorkshire Council after feedback from the public.Wetherby-based developer Caddick Group said it had received 96 responses during a three-week consultation on its plans to build the village of Maltkiln between York and Harrogate.The Maltkiln scheme would include two primary schools, a community centre and healthcare facilities.Caddick Group director Chris Procter said the feedback had helped the developer "ensure Maltkiln can serve the needs of the community".
Changes include new crossing points on the A59 to make it safer for pedestrians, improvements to the bridge over the railway line and better cycle access through the site.The sports hub would be moved closer to the proposed village centre and railway station, while the location of the primary schools would also be changed.Caddick Group said it would create walking, cycling and horse-riding routes between the existing villages of Green Hammerton and Kirk Hammerton.Mr Procter said: "We are grateful for the feedback received from the local community and stakeholders, some of which has enabled us to further refine our plans and ensure that Maltkiln serves the needs of the community both now and in the future."
The consultation period included a public event at Kirk Hammerton in May attended by more than 200 people.Green Party councillor Arnold Warneken told the Local Democracy Reporting Service he believed infrastructure must be in place before the homes are built.He said residents remained concerned about the use of green space between Green Hammerton and Kirk Hammerton.He said: “It doesn’t come cheap to build infrastructure. The more they do to address concerns the more expensive it becomes."The improvements they are proposing might be phased in rather than put in place on day one."
North Yorkshire Council submitted its Maltkiln development plan in April to the government’s Planning Inspectorate ahead of an examination.Planning permission has not yet been granted, but the council has a say in how the scheme will be developed.During the examination, which is set to take place at a later date, the inspector will hold public sessions where residents and can make further representations about the plans.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
