Details have been released of a Â£250m redevelopment of a student housing block.Fresh images show how Newcastle University's Castle Leazes will be overhauled, after the city council approved the demolition of the site.It is to be redeveloped with housing for 2,011 students, as well as a new student village.Castle Leazes - which was built in the 1960s - is to be torn down after being deemed outdated.
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the block is due to be closed this summer at the end of the 2023/24 academic year.
Bosses from the university and student housing provider Unite Students have lodged full proposals for the revamp.The development also includes study spaces, a gym, karaoke and cinema rooms, a games area and a cafe.The application to the Labour-led local authority said: "The positive experience which many former students have had at Castle Leazes highlight it as being a friendly halls of residence."It is in an attractive setting which is close to the campus and the city's other facilities, as well as being a place where new students are able to make friendships and feel welcome as part of Newcastle University and the city itself."
The university says it needs 4,500 rooms to meet a commitment to offer accommodation to all of its first year students, but currently only has 3,500.There are 17 accommodation buildings on the Spital Tongues site which have been proposed for demolition, which, if approved, is expected to take about a year.
