A life-size safety village has been awarded more than £53k to help educate young people on the dangers of knife crime.Office for the Police and Crime Commissioner in Gloucestershire (OPCC) gave the money to SkillZONE, which teaches children and young adults to stay safe at its centre in Tuffley.The centre has a number of zones, including a police station, home, train station and alleyway, which will be used in new anti-knife crime project, "Knife or Your Life".Gloucestershire's police and crime commissioner, Chris Nelson, said: “Although we have witnessed fewer knife crimes than other parts of the country, we will always treat serious violence as a priority”.
The money donated by the OPCC to SkillZONE will go towards the making of a film focusing on how county lines gangs target vulnerable young people.It will also be spent on recruiting a project lead and evaluation officer for the early intervention youth programme and new equipment for the organisation.Mr Nelson said: “Although we have witnessed fewer offences involving bladed weapons than other parts of the country, that is no consolation to those who have lost loved ones as a result.“I am committed to tackling all aspects of knife crime and am pleased my office was able to get money from the Serious Violence Duty Fund that will help prevent the needless loss of young lives”.More than 60,000 people have visited SkillZONE since it opened 12 years ago.
