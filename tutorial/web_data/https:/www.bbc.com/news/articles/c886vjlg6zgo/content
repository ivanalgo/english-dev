A group created to champion the heritage of the south of the Isle of Man is preparing to mark ten years of exhibitions and publications.Rushen Heritage Trust is hosting a special display featuring a collection of its previous project at Port St Mary Town Hall on Thursday from 12:00 to 18:00 BST.The event will feature displays on Rushen Internment Camp, Milner Tower, the Port Erin Marine Laboratory and tourism in the south of the island.Chairman Robert Graham said it aimed to "bring together" those who have been involved or attended events over the past decade with "who have not yet discovered us".
The group was founded in 2014 by Hugh and Sandra Davidson after the couple had held a public meeting to gage the interest in setting up a heritage group for Rushen. Since then, Rushen Heritage Trust has held exhibitions, published seven books and hosted an annual series of talks.A dedicated centre for the trust, created out of a disused bus shelter, was opened in June 2021 and gave volunteers a dedicate space to hold exhibitions.Mr Graham said the group had "come a long way in the last decade", and the opening of that centre had been "a major milestone"."As well as looking back over the last 10 years, we are keen to look to the future, to see how the trust can develop its ties with the community and help celebrate Rushen's heritage," he added.
