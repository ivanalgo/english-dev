A man who transformed his village to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings said he hoped the display would entice young people to learn more about World War Two. Walter Gunston, from Isleham, Cambridgeshire, said he had spent a lot of time and money to ensure the area had been decorated.As part of the anniversary, Mr Gunston sounded an air raid siren at the top of the Lime kilns and in the churchyard of St Andrews, Isleham. The 68-year-old said he wanted the decorations to encourage others to explore more of the day's history and the sacrifices made during the period.  
"It's all about spreading the word," Mr Gunston said. "I love doing it, especially when you see people stop in their tracks. When I see them smile from ear to ear I know I have done my job and that's what counts."Mr Gunston decorated his home as well as several locations in the village. He has offered to decorate other events and said the bunting would appear again on 2 September 2025 to mark 80 years since World War Two ended.Mr Gunston said he had lived in the area all his life and his neighbours had come to expect his displays.He has transformed the outside of his house in the past to honour the NHS, Armed Forces Day, Remembrance Sunday and Christmas, where he used 9,200 lights as decoration.Mr Gunston keeps a 6m (19ft) pole outside of his home, which he uses to fly a variety of flags.
