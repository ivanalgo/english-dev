Hospitals across the region are to use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to reduce unnecessary admissions and lengthy stays, bosses have said.NHS Humber Health Partnership said its Flow initiative includes measures designed to streamline every stage of a patient’s progress from emergency department to discharge. AI software will be used to prepare X-ray reports and read blood test results, while bosses have pledged rapid assessments in emergency departments, more home-based treatments and virtual wards,Jonathan Lofthouse, group chief executive of NHS Humber Health Partnership, said the "transformative project" would create "meaningful and lasting change".
“Every stage of the patient’s journey will be evaluated to ensure people receive the best treatment in the right place when they need it,” he added.Hull Royal Infirmary, Grimsby's Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital, Scunthorpe General Hospital, Goole and District Hospital and Castle Hill Hospital in Cottingham are all taking part.The partnership said virtual wards would end time-consuming outpatient appointments and prevent emergency and unnecessary admissions to hospital, while the use of specialist AI software would help doctors to provide more “hands-on” patient care.It also said patient packs would be issued within 24 hours of arrival at hospital, outlining expected treatment such as scans, tests or surgery and estimated dates of discharge.Elsewhere, enhanced rounds would review every patient daily before 10:00 to check treatment is on track and discharge dates are appropriate. The partnership said staff would coordinate care so people can go home as soon as they are well enough.
