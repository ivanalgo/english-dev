A group accused of attempting to kidnap a coroner have said how they were "instructed" to do so by a man they believed had judicial powers.Four people are alleged to have stormed Essex Coroner's Court, in Chelmsford, during a bid to abduct senior coroner Lincoln Brookes in April 2023.Mr Brookes, who was not at the court that day "by chance", told a trial he was left fearing for the safety of his family over the plot.Mark Christopher, 58, Matthew Martin, 47, Shiza Harper, 45, and Sean Harper, 38 - from east London and Essex - all deny a series of offences.
The trial at Chelmsford Crown Court has previously heard Mr Christopher was the "chief judge" of the so-called Federal Postal Court.The group have said how members of the public could subscribe to the online movement and be taught by Mr Christopher about the "tricks and traps" of the "corrupt" English language.However, prosecutor Allister Walker said Mr Christopher had nothing other than "self-conferred" legal powers.
On Friday, jurors were played video footage of each defendant's interview with the police, having been arrested after entering the courtroom.Mr Harper, from South Benfleet, Essex, told officers he was a "student" of the "very knowledgeable" Mr Christopher - who employed him as a sheriff.He said the group issued a warrant to Mr Brookes, as Essex Coroner's Court was "causing harm to the people"."These people are running private racketeering and things like that," he claimed.Fellow sheriff Mr Martin said he became aware of Mr Christopher's "teachings" on YouTube."We learned how to break words down," he said during interview."The English language has a lot of corruption in it. The corruption can also keep you a prisoner."
Jurors have been told that Mr Martin was in possession of handcuffs when he was arrested outside the court.He admitted not being "1,000% comfortable putting handcuffs on people", but said "Mark instructs me to do it".Ms Harper, also from South Benfleet, said she attended the court in the role of a "postal inspector".She said she was there to “serve a warrant on Lincoln Brookes as the coroner”.
During Mr Christopher's interview, he told officers he did not define as a person.He argued that if he claimed to be a person then he would be admitting to being "a persona, an actor".
Mr Christopher said his fellow defendants were "students" of his who had "volunteered to educate people to the corruption that's taking place" in language.He added that he instructed his sheriffs to bring handcuffs when executing warrants in case "people get violent".The trial has been shown a video of the group wearing high-visibility jackets as they entered courtroom two at Seax House in Chelmsford.Area coroner Michelle Brown, who was in the middle of an inquest hearing at the time, could be heard saying: "Please don't resort to violence."The defendants all deny conspiracy to kidnap and conspiracy to commit false imprisonment.Mr Martin, from Plaistow, east London, also denies assault by beating of a security guard at the court and the damage of his spectacles.Mr Christopher, from Forest Gate, east London, has pleaded not guilty to sending threatening letters to Mr Brookes with intent to cause distress or anxiety.The trial continues.
