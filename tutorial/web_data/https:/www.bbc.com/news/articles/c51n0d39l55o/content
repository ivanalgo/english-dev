Shetland is set to have its first whisky distillery.Lerwick Distillery is expected to open its doors later this year.It has been founded by local businesspeople Martin Watt, Calum Miller and Caroline MacIntyre and is based in the town's Market Street. The initial spirit will be called Haad Still - a traditional Shetland dialect phrase for hold still - before it matures. 
A spirit cannot be legally called a whisky until it has aged for a minimum of three years and a day, though buyers will be able to buy the spirit before then.The company plans to also run tours of the distillery for the tourism market.Ian Millar, who has worked in the industry for more than 50 years, has been appointed master distiller.Founders Mr Watt and Mr Miller have backgrounds in chartered accountancy and architecture, with sales director Ms MacIntyre coming from hospitality and sales.
The venture has been supported by Shetland Islands Council, via a start-up grant, and Business Gateway, which provides free business support in Scotland.Lerwick Distillery director Mr Watt praised the "excellent" local support which he said had made developing the venture possible.Business Gateway adviser Diana Abernethy said: "To be able to help Martin and Calum reach the goal of being the first distillery on the island has been fantastic."It’s an exciting brand and journey they’re embarking on and will give such a boost to tourism in the area and the local economy."
