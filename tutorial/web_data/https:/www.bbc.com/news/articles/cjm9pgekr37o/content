A seaside town has been yarn-bombed with a display of knitted summer treats.The anonymous Knitoholics regularly decorate Weymouth quayside with their creations.The group's "Ice Cream Dreams" installations, which will be on show until September, celebrate childhood memories of Neapolitan ice creams being sold from bicycles.A Knitoholic told the BBC: “We meet every Wednesday in the pub to knit and this particular creation we have been working on since March."
The group is made up of four grandmothers in their 60s and "one very talented granddaughter" who helps out with the designs and sketches.A spokesperson for the knitters explained: "I lost my dad this year and I have fond memories of him buying an ice cream from the bicycles."I took my own grandchildren... and seeing their amazed faces made me wonder if we as a group could knit something that would have the same effect on adults."
Over the years the group has knitted a variety of displays, including reindeer at Christmas and monster heads at Halloween. The spokesperson said: "At Easter we created our most ambitious creation yet which was Wallace and Gromits - it was challenging because we had to get their faces right."However, the display they loved the most was for Remembrance Day, of soldiers, sailors, RAF airmen and a guardsmen overlooking the pier.“We love to make people smile and enjoy seeing the comments," the spokesperson added.
