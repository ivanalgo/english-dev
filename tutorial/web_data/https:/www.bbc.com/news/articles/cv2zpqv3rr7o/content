Guernsey Ports is pushing ahead with plans to make more money from the harbour and airport. Above-inflation increases to passenger fees, freight and mooring charges from April 2024 have been approved by the States Trading Supervisory Board.Leisure mooring fees will see the largest increase, with the average annual charge for a medium-sized boat going up by about £400.Guernsey Ports said the move would reduce the requirement for taxpayer funding.
The cost of a marina berth will rise by between 12% and 22% above inflation.In the year ending in September, inflation was running at 7.0%.The introduction of a sliding scale would mean owners of smaller vessels would see a lower percentage increase than those with larger vessels, bosses said.An adult air fare to or from the UK was to increase by 82p, and the same journey by sea would cost 71p more, they added. The changes would raise additional revenues of about £5m in 2024 and reduce Guernsey Ports’ deficit, bosses said.Any impact from the rises is due to be reviewed before any decision is made on charges for 2025 and 2026, with much depending on the recovery in passenger numbers.The ports authority said it needed to increase investment in key infrastructure at a time when revenues were still impacted by the post-Covid downturn, with passenger numbers expected to be about 15% lower in 2023 than pre-pandemic levels.The authority is forecast to make a loss of £6m in 2023, bringing the amount of taxpayer funding since 2020 to about £30m.Ports managing director Colin Le Ray said: “Given the current pressure on States finances, it was felt important to make significant inroads in reducing Guernsey Ports reliance on general revenue.“We are also aiming to reduce our operating costs. "A full review of expenditure is under way to identify savings and efficiencies, and those will be key to improving our financial position."
