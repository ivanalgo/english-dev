Scottish Conservative MSP Russell Findlay has announced he is running to succeed Douglas Ross as party leader.Mr Findlay, a former journalist, is the party's justice spokesperson at Holyrood. He is the first party member to officially enter the running, with several colleagues thought to be considering bids. Mr Ross announced he would step down following a row over his decision to stand as a candidate in the UK general election, despite previously vowing to stand down to concentrate on his duties at the Scottish Parliament. 
Scottish Conservative Deputy Leader Megan Gallacher, chairman Craig Hoy and business spokesperson Murdo Fraser have been tipped as potential leadership candidates, as have backbenchers Jamie Greene and Maurice Golden. The party's management board met earlier this month but it is yet to announce details about any potential contest. Mr Findlay, the West of Scotland MSP since 2021, previously wrote books on gangland crime and was the victim of an acid attack in 2015, when an assailant appeared at his door disguised as a postman.He vowed to build a "positive, modern" party in Scotland.
"We must refocus our efforts from predominantly battling against independence to instead leading a patriotic conservative movement that stands for aspiration and ambition," he said."We've got to set out a positive conservative vision that appeals to the interests, hopes and needs of ordinary people the length and breadth of Scotland."We need to provide tangible, practical and pragmatic ideas and solutions that will change everyday lives for the better."Mr Findlay said there had been "many mishaps" during 14 years of Conservative government at a UK level, and admitted he had made a "mistake" in backing Liz Truss to be prime minister in 2022.The leadership candidate told BBC Scotland News that the two-child benefit cap should "probably" be scrapped, but added that he wanted to look at the policy in more detail.He said he was “firmly against"  the Scottish Tories splitting from the UK party – a proposal that was debated during the previous leadership contest in 2011.
Mr Findlay has been backed by frontbench colleagues Rachael Hamilton, Douglas Lumsden and Miles Briggs.Mr Ross has said he would continue in the role until a new leader is selected after being defeated by the SNP in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East at the general election.He stood in place of former local MP David Duguid, who had been unwell in hospital but had hoped to run for election. The Scottish Conservatives said a consultation was taking place to gather views from members on the process for the leadership contest.A spokesperson added: "The management board will then meet in the coming weeks to discuss those views and further details about the contest will be outlined."
