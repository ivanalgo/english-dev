NHS Suffolk said there had been some reports of GP practices having problems accessing their systems, but patients were urged to still attend their appointments.
Woolpit Health Centre in Bury St Edmunds said it was one of the GP surgeries which had experienced problems.Contrary to the NHS Suffolk advice, in a post on social media, a Woolpit spokesperson said: "We still cannot view clinical records to enable us to provide safe care, process prescriptions or make appointments. "For safety reasons we are currently not accepting econsults. "We ask that patients not telephone or attend the practice unless it is an urgent issue."West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust confirmed it had found only two internal systems disrupted, but they did not directly have an impact on patient care."Mitigations and workarounds are in place," a spokesperson added."We ask our patients to attend hospital appointments unless told otherwise."
