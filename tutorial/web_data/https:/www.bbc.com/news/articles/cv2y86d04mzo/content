About 200 pupils in West Sussex have been given a place at a school they did not include in their three preferences.West Sussex County Council said 86.8% of Year 6 children will be offered their first preference school, an improvement of 0.4% from last year.But some pupils might still travel to schools 17 miles away from where they live.Parent campaign group The Future of Adur School Team (FAST) said it will take the council to the Local Government Ombudsman.
Kevin Whitehead’s son was given a place at Steyning Grammar School, which is 13 miles from the family home in Southwater.Single parent Mr Whitehead told BBC Radio Sussex last week it will be “almost impossible” to get his son to school on time.Louise Friend, from Southwater, said her son was also given a place almost 13 miles away.The council faced similar issues last year when children in Shoreham were sent to a school in Worthing.Councillor Jacquie Russell, the council's cabinet member for children and young people, said this year’s shortage is due to an increased birth rate and because parents want their children to attend mixed-sex schools.
She told BBC Radio Sussex: “As a county council, we do have to see whether the trend is a blip.“It’s not really a case, this year, of apologising. Last year, our apology was completely justified. It was quite clear there was an awareness that there was a bulge class coming to the fore.”Ms Russell said the situation in Shoreham has improved on last year, adding: “Do not underestimate the work the officers have put in.”She said parents are entitled to appeal and if it is the case the boys who live in Southwater do have to attend Steyning Grammar School, they would be offered dedicated transport as there is no public transport option.A consultation into changing Millais School, in Horsham, into a mixed-sex school is under way.
