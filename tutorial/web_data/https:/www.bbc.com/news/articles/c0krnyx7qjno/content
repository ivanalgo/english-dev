Mystery surrounds the hands on a clock tower after they became “curled up, bent and out of shape”.The Keynsham Clock, which was commissioned by Bath and North East Somerset (BANES) Council in 2015, has three sides and three clock faces. Only one of the faces is affected.One of the clock hands is still attached, whilst another has fallen loose within the casing.A spokesperson from BANES Council said: “We are aware of the problem and will be fixing it.”
The cause of the problem is not yet clear, but there is speculation that the damage occurred in the recent hot weather.  
Debbie, who lives in the town, told BBC Radio Bristol: "The banding around the clock has come off, I think." Her theory is that the black banding broke off before landing in the middle of the two hands, causing one to break. Others have likened the clock to "ribbons", a "spider" and Salvador Dali's painting, The Persistence of Memory.
