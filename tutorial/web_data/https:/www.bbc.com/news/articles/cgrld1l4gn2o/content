Proposed laws that would give terminally ill people on the Isle of Man the right to choose to end their lives have been passed by the House of Keys.The Assisted Dying Bill 2023 would allow adults given a prognosis of 12 months or less left to live the right to choose to end their life.The bill was supported by two-thirds of the island's 24 MHKs at its third reading, meaning it will now move to the Legislative Council for consideration.Alex Allinson, who put the private member's bill forward, said the legislation would give "choice, autonomy and dignity" to those at the end of life.
Under the provisions, those eligible would need to be over the age of 18 and have lived on the Isle of Man for five years.While those supporting the proposals argued people should be given that choice, opponents have described it as "unworkable" and "unsafe".Dr Allinson said numerous amendments to the original draft meant "what started out as a bill put forward by one member is now legislation amended  and considered by the whole house".But Tim Glover described the proposed bill as a "Pandora's box", adding that the views of a number of charities, community groups and churches had not been sought.
Chief Minister Alfred Cannan raised concerns over the increase from six months life expectancy to 12 and noted that under the proposals only people "capable of ingesting the poison themselves" would be eligible.Chris Thomas said any decision on proposed assisted dying legislation should be what was best for the Isle of Man, and not based on the campaigns of UK pressure groups.Julie Edge said she believed it was “irresponsible” to support legislation where there was a lack of detail on how, where and by whom the service would be provided and administered, and how it would be funded.While some MHKs voiced concerns that the process had been rushed, Rob Callister said he could not remember another piece of legislation that had "commanded so much time and energy".David Ashford said while the bill was "not perfect", he had "come to the conclusion there will never be a perfect bill in this regard, no matter how much scrutiny is applied". Supporting the proposals, Daphne Caine said although dying was "inevitable" the law change would "allow people to adjust the time of their death".Echoing those comments, John Wannenburgh said the legislation would give people the ability to “avail themselves with the greatest single act of dignity and compassion, not because it is easy but because it is right”.However, along with several other MHKs, Ann Corlett warned that members still had "a long way to go”, with the need for the consideration of secondary legislation and regulations, should the bill progress in the upper chamber and receive Royal Assent.The Assisted Dying Bill 2023 will be considered by the Legislative Council following the summer recess of Tynwald, which runs until October.
