Plans have been submitted for a battery storage facility which could power up to 162,000 homes.Net Zero Seventeen Ltd wants to create the facility on agricultural land in Aspatria, Cumbria.It has applied to Cumberland Council for permission to build the site on fields at West Farm, West Street, off the A596.Those behind the plans said the project would "support the move towards a low carbon energy network", as it would help release electricity at periods of high demand and store it at times when it is not needed.
Net Zero Seventeen said the proposed development would store enough electricity to power about 161,897 homes for two hours.The 7.4-hectare (18.3-acre) site would be operational for 40 years, after which time it would be decommissioned and equipment removed from the land.
The company said schemes relevant to the one it was proposing had already been approved in the area in recent years, including a solar farm to the north-east of the site in 2014, Westnewton Wind Farm in 2011 and five battery storage facilities in the Carlisle area, all approved between 2017 and 2024.In documents submitted to the council's planning department, the company explained the increase in interest associated with battery storage facilities in the area.It said: "This is as a result of increasing reliance on renewable sources, such as wind and solar, due to the need to phase out coal and gas in the next few years, and oil over the coming decades."It added battery storage facilities helped ensure "cost minimisation" and increased efficiency "by reducing power losses".Cumberland Council has launched a consultation on the plans, which is open until 24 June.
