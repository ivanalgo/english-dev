Library services across Derbyshire face cuts as the council looks to balance its books.But the leader of Derbyshire County Council, Barry Lewis, has pledged that none of its 45 libraries will shut “on his watch”.Instead, it is proposed opening hours at all but two of the county’s libraries will be reduced and the authority will explore opportunities to share buildings with other services to cut costs.A public consultation into the four-year plan to make the required £625,000 savings will be held if the draft plans are given the go-ahead on Thursday.
Council leader Barry Lewis said the aim of the changes was to keep library buildings open as community hubs while keeping the service sustainable.He added: “We fully acknowledge the importance of having a strong library which is why, despite huge budget pressures continuing to face the council, we are doing all we can to ensure we can offer a modern, agile and sustainable service which is fit for the future.“I have always said that no libraries will close on my watch, and the proposals ensure library services are maintained and investment is made where it is needed.”
If approved, the plans, which the public can have their say on, will recommend reducing opening hours by an average of 10% apart from at community-run libraries in Tideswell and Woodville.The council said neighbouring libraries would not shut on the same day of the week, all libraries would be open on Saturdays, and larger libraries would open until 18:00 twice a week.The council said it would invest in technology for the smaller libraries and introduce smaller, low-carbon vehicles for a new outreach service to replace the existing mobile and home library schemes.
As at Killamarsh, where the library has relocated inside a leisure centre, the council would explore opportunities to share space in existing buildings.A drive to recruit more volunteers would also form part of the strategy.Mr Lewis said: “A lot of hard work, thought and planning has gone into developing this new draft strategy which we are confident will ensure libraries and the service as a whole can go from strength to strength for years to come.“Due to the budget issues still facing the council, the service must make some savings and we believe the proposals, including a relatively small reduction in opening hours, are the best and fairest way to achieve them.“No decisions will be made before people have had the opportunity to have their say.”Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
