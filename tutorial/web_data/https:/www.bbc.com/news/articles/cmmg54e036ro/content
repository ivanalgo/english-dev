A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and drug driving after a crash on the M6 Toll. Officers were called just before midday on Tuesday after a Vauxhall Corsa was reported to have hit a barrier on the southbound carriageway, said police. A woman in her late teens, who was a passenger in the car, was taken to hospital with injuries which were not believed to be life-threatening. A 21-year-old man, of no fixed addressed, who police believed to be the driver, was arrested and remained in custody. 
" Officers went to the scene and closed the road straight away," said a spokesperson for Staffordshire Police. The M6 Toll remained shut overnight but has since reopened. Anyone who saw the collision or who has dashcam footage was asked to contact the force.
