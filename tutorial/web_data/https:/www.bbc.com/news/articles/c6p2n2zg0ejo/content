Two controversial chess picnic tables costing £2,500 each are to be officially unveiled.Cumberland Council has installed the government-funded tables at Hammond’s Pond and Bitts Park in Carlisle.Reaction on social media to the installations has been mixed with some branding them "nice, but expensive."The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the funding for the tables "was committed by the previous government."
This body was previously the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, until the new government scrapped the "levelling up" from its title.Another social media post said: "I mean it's nice to see something being done for the public but seriously there are bigger fish to fry than this".
Cumberland Council previously said it had not applied for the funding."These were put in place in March this year after we received £5,000 funding. "This funding was specific to this grant scheme and could not be used for any other use," the local authority said.
Twenty of the boards, which do not include chess pieces, have been placed around Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Cumbria.In a social media post Ben Rogerson, of Carlisle, said: "Bet they'll get plenty of use."I mean it's nice to see something being done for the public but seriously there are bigger fish to fry than this."Suzanne, also from Carlisle, commented: "The idea that a northern city centre has a need for these in lieu of more suitable facilities which may actually be used, is patronising in the extreme. "An example of misguided allocation of spending," she said, adding: "This is an expensive bench."
Cumberland Council is hosting a launch event at Hammond’s Pond from 16:30 to 18:00 BST for members of the public get to know more about chess.John Lydon, Cumbria junior chess organiser, will give a short talk and members of Carlisle Chess Club will be on hand to give advice and tips on the game."Chess in a very inclusive game where male and female, young and old, disabled and able-bodied people can all play and compete on equal terms," Mr Lydon said.
