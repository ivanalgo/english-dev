A second union representing council waste and recycling staff has voted to strike in a row over pay.Unison described a wage offer from Cosla to local government workers in 14 areas including Glasgow, Perth and Kinross and Dumfries and Galloway as “inadequate”.It comes just two weeks after members of the GMB and Unite unions voted in favour of industrial action. This means the majority of Scottish councils are affected.Cosla said it was "disappointed" strike action was being considered, describing its offer as "strong".
More than 95% of Unison members backed strike action in a ballot.Cosla’s offer would have seen workers receive a 2.2% wage increase from 1 April and an additional 2% from 1 October.However, the union’s head of local government, David O’Connor, said staff felt “let down” by the deal.He said: “Council workers deserve a wage that reflects their essential roles.“With over 95% of those voting saying they are ready to take industrial action, it demonstrates how they feel, not only about the pay offer, but how undervalued they are feeling generally.“Cosla and the Scottish government have to understand the anger amongst local government workers. They feel let down.”
Unison workers are set to strike in the following areas:
Waste workers walked out in Edinburgh for 12 days during the city’s festival season in 2022, leading to mounds of rubbish littering the streets.Colette Hunter, Unison’s local government committee chairwoman, said a repeat of those scenes across Scotland was likely unless Cosla came forward with a new offer.“Large parts of Scotland are weeks away from bins not being collected and rubbish piling up in the streets,” she said.“No-one wants to go on strike, it is always a last resort. But, local government workers have firmly rejected Cosla’s offer.“They are simply asking for a pay deal that addresses below-inflation pay settlements.“Cosla needs to get back around the table with us.”
A Cosla spokeswoman said the offer tabled to staff was "at the limit of affordability".She added: “We are disappointed that strike action is being considered in some areas, and are concerned about the detrimental impact this disruption would have on our people and communities. "Dialogue with our trade unions, who have been comprehensively briefed on the financial circumstances councils are facing, is ongoing. "We remain committed to reaching a resolution as quickly as possible.”
