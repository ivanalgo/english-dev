A couple have held their wedding reception at a service station in Surrey.Along with 42 guests, Stacey and her partner Graham celebrated their union at what they say is their favourite venue in the world - Cobham Services on the M25.The bride, from Surrey, said it had fulfilled a childhood dream as she had always wanted a “fast-food wedding”.The wedding party was treated to a selection of McDonald meals.
Stacey admitted it was an “unconventional, but unforgettable setting”, but added: “Back from when I was a child, I’d always dreamed of wearing a pink princess dress and having my wedding reception in a fast food outlet.“I’ve repeatedly stated that fact, but even just two days before my wedding, my siblings couldn’t believe I was choosing to have it in a motorway service station – but it’s what I’d always wanted.”She added: “A massive thank you to everyone at Extra for helping a little girl’s dream to come true.”
Tom Dobson, chief executive at Extra MSA, which operates Cobham services, said it was the first time the services had hosted a wedding reception.“We’re thrilled that we could make this unique celebration a reality,” he said.Stacey’s grandmother, Dawn, who also acted as the wedding organiser, said the service station had confirmed the booking within a day of making the enquiry.“They cordoned off a designated area and set up tables and chairs to suit our seating plan and guest numbers,” she said.“Several families at the services said to us what a great idea it was to host a wedding reception at a motorway service station, so who knows, maybe we’ve started a trend.”
