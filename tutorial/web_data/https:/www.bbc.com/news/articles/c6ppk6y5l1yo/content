A council leader has vowed not to introduce fortnightly bin collections despite pressure from the government to save cash. Ribble Valley Council has been told to draw up plans identifying efficiencies or changes to "boost productivity". Green councillor Malcolm Peplow said a move from weekly to fortnightly bin collections should be considered in this search for savings. But Conservative council leader Stephen Atkinson said the party would "stick to its promise" not to move away from weekly rounds.
The order for local authorities to produce productivity by mid-July has come from the Department for Levelling-Up, Housing and Communities. Each is expected to cover all areas of council activity as part of a push to tackle "waste and barriers to progress", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.Officers told Ribble Valley councillors the plan was still required despite the general election. Mr Peplow told a council meeting that no areas of current council policy, such as weekly bin collections, should be out-of-bounds. Leader Mr Atkinson replied: "From the Conservative group’s perspective, we will not be moving away from weekly bin collections. "It’s what we promised and it’s important that we stick to it."He said he felt strongly about the issue and referred to a recent poll suggesting public trust in politics was at it lowest-ever rating.Meanwhile Conservative council Stuart Hirst said the government savings request was "annoying"."It’s another example in the long line of government interference which has gone on for years. "It’s teaching us to suck eggs," he added.
