A music artist who will be performing at Latitude Festival for the first time almost faced missing it due to her sister's upcoming wedding. Samfire, who describes herself as an "alt-pop, synth-obsessed artist and producer", will open the Alcove stage at the Suffolk festival in Henham Park near Southwold on Sunday.However had her booking been the day before, she would have had to pick between playing and her sister's wedding in Aldeburgh.She told BBC Introducing Norfolk & Suffolk despite the close call, it had been timed perfectly. 
"My parents said there is a terrible chance you're going to play Latitude and it's going to fall on your sister's wedding, and you're still going to have to play," she explained."My parents are very support. They said we'd have to make it work."She added that being asked to play by the Introducing team had been the highlight of her year."[This] means so, so much to me," she said. 
Esme Emerson, from Brantham on the Suffolk/Essex border, will be performing on the Introducing Stage as well as in Lavish Lounge Arena on Friday."[Latitude] was our go-to [festival] as kids," said Emerson, who is one half of the band."It's been a long time since we've been back and it's always been on the bucket list.""It was where we fell in love with music," added his sister, Esme. "I was probably 16 when I did the whole post-high school thing."The brother-sister duo will also be supporting Keane on their upcoming tour. 
EV, from Ipswich did his first ever headline show in April and will now play The Alcove stage on Friday."It's been on my bucket list for this year," he explained."I'm playing a couple of other [festivals] and I wanted to do something closer to home."I've [done] the London headliner, I've got Boardmasters and I couldn't get any further away, so to be playing Latitude is sick. "I'm buzzing for festival season."
