Writing on the social media site X, Glasgow city council said: "Glasgow is a football city - and proud to be home to some of the biggest teams in the game."Fans support their club, whatever the result - and when they win, celebrations are to be savoured. However, when things get out of hand there can be a negative impact on other Glaswegians and for visitors to our city."In recent year many people have felt uncomfortable and even unsafe when supporters have congregated in places like Trongate or George Square to celebrate."Residents and businesses have had to deal with the aftermath of littering, vandalism and other antisocial behaviour once the crowds have headed home."As this season reaches its conclusion over the next two weekends, we want everyone to be able to celebrate safely, responsibly and with consideration for others. "Whoever you support, whatever the results - enjoy yourself but please respect the city."

Scottish actor and Celtic fan Tony Roper spoke to BBC Scotland as he was going into the stadium.Asked if he was looking forward to the day, Mr Roper said: "I'm not looking forward to it all, I'm very unhappy."We've not done well this season, just as everybody predicted. Brendan's been a flop, the team lost too many goals...wait a minute, what am I talking about?"We've won it, we've won the league. I'm absolutely delighted, I can't be any happier."
