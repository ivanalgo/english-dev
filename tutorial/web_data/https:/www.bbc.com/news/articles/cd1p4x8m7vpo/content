Can you imagine wanting to become a local councillor in your twenties?To be honest, it is unlikely many twenty-somethings would want to plunge into the somewhat unglamorous world of street lights and litter bins.Tilley Rees, 22, is among those looking into how to interest more fresh new faces into entering local government.She questions the accessibility of local democracy and whether there is "the language to ensure that young people understand the processes". 
At a time when fewer than four in 10 people even bothered to vote at the latest council elections, it is part of a campaign to improve Wales’ democracy.It is specifically targeting how to attract more young people to stand as town and community councillors."Some of the research has happened, there's been a lot of like, not enough engagement and there's not enough education around encouraging young people to get involved," said Tilley.She is a student at the University of Wales Trinity St David in Carmarthen and represents young people on the body looking into the issue.
Students in the Ceredigion university town of Aberystwyth said they saw and felt the obstacles facing younger people.Fflur Wyn Davies, 20, said one reason for them failing to engage was a lack of confidence and knowledge about their community.Gwenno Roberts, 18, said when she thought about her town council "older people come to mind… they are majorly over their 50s".Dafydd James, 21, felt that being on a council was "something that nanas and grandads did"."I don’t think it’s ever crossed my mind to become a councillor," he added. At 25, Rhodri Phillips was elected a town councillor in Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthenshire, in August."Obviously the community is made up of people of various ages," he said."So it is important to have that represented within the town council."
He said Newcastle Emlyn had a few re-occurring problems, so "it's nice to have a fresh set of eyes on that and maybe some new ideas to move forward with".The Welsh government set up the Democratic Health Task and Finish Group after the last elections in May 2022 to try to improve the situation.At Wales' local council elections last year only 38% of people turned out to vote. Town and community councils are at the level below Wales’ 22 borough and county councils, such as Cardiff, Gwynedd and Powys.Of all the town and community council seats in Wales, 78% were either uncontested or unfilled.This has raised questions about how town and community councils look, and who they represent."I think there are concerns about diversity and democracy generally,” said Local Government Minister Rebecca Evans, who set up the group.“But certainly it is the case in town and community councils where we don't have as many young people and people from diverse backgrounds standing as we would like."
