Time is "running out" to save Lough Neagh, the Minister for Agriculture Andrew Muir has said. It is understood that significant investment is needed to tackle the environmental issues facing the lough. A new report was commissioned after blue-green algae bloomed at unprecedented levels last year.The report, outlining more than 30 recommendations, was due to be agreed on Thursday, but an agreement was not reached. It's understood the Mr Muir will bring the Lough Neagh report back before the Executive on 27 June.Pollution in the lough and catchment area is the main cause of the blue-green algae, which is extremely toxic to animals and can cause illness in humans.
Some of the suggested actions are already planned, including the Farming with Nature scheme and several training programmes for farmers.But money will need to be found for others, such as an initiative to research potential solutions, additional water quality Inspectors and a centralised resource for science around Lough Neagh.Most of the report's proposals are thought to fall to DAERA.A smaller number, mostly concerning enforcement and regulation, are expected to involve the infrastructure and justice departments.Mr Muir told the assembly in April that Lough Neagh is a "priority" and called on assembly members to "get real" about the problems.He is expected to reverse an instruction from his predecessor Edwin Poots, which placed a cap on fines for repeated negligent failures to comply with environmental, health and animal welfare rules.Ownership of Lough Neagh is not believed to form part of the report.Many of its elements are also part of the overdue legally-required Environmental Improvement Plan, which has been awaiting executive approval since March.
Lough Neagh is the largest body of fresh water in the British Isles.The ownership has been in the Earl of Shaftesbury's estate since the 1800s.The rights to the lough were given a price tag of Â£6m 10 years ago, but civil servants at the time advised the government not to go ahead with the sale. It is not known why.Nicolas Ashley-Cooper, who is the 12th member of his family to hold the title, told BBC News NI in October that a sale was something he was willing to discuss again.Lough Neagh supplies half of Belfast's drinking water and 40% of Northern Ireland's overall.
The Lough Neagh Report is expected to put in place short, medium and long-term actions to tackle the problems that have developed over years.It is long-awaited, with broader implications for the overall improvement of water quality right across Northern Ireland.Those improvements will come at a price, with some recommendations understood to potentially cost millions in an already-constrained Stormont budget.But ministers will have to put their money where their mouths are, if their professed concern for the condition of the lough is to be taken seriously.
