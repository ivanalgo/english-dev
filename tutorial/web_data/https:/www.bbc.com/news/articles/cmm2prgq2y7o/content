The success of clean air policies calls into question the "Smoggies" nickname attached to Middlesbrough's residents, according to a senior council figure. The town's air quality has improved “significantly” since statutory limits on pollutants were imposed by the government more than 30 years ago, Middlesbrough Council said.The council's executive heard pollutants such as sulphur dioxide from coal burning and lead from petrol were at a fraction of previous levels.Executive member for community safety, Janet Thompson, said she did "not see why we should be called Smoggies".
She was speaking at a meeting to discuss results of the monitoring and the South Tees Clean Air Quality Strategy, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.Ms Thompson said the number of people signing up for the chargeable green waste collection service "proves that people are on board with our clean air strategy".
A report to the Executive said the latest results available showed air quality in Middlesbrough was "good" and complied with national objectives. The report added: “However, whilst air quality has improved, it still remains the largest environmental health risk in the UK and the World Health Organisation advocates that there is no clear evidence of a safe level of exposure to air pollution below which there is no risk of adverse health effects."Middlesbrough Mayor Chris Cooke said: "From what the data shows, we are definitely going in the right direction."Launched in 2019, the South Tees Clean Air Strategy was developed jointly with Redcar and Cleveland Council.Many schemes have already been implemented to improve air quality with partners and stakeholders.Ongoing initiatives include replacing the council's fleet with zero emission vehicles by 2029, the promotion of affordable warmth schemes across the South Tees area and an on-street electric vehicle charging point trial.
