A 15-year-old boy was sold a bottle of Corona beer by a Nab Wood shop during an undercover operation, a court has heard.Dalia Said Hammad, the owner of Nab Wood Convenience Store, appeared at Bradford and Keighley Magistrates’ Court and admitted selling alcohol to someone under the age of 18.The court heard that although it was not Hammad, 44, of Abbott Road, Leeds, who sold the beer, he was responsible due to being the store owner.Magistrates said there was a shortcoming in training and fined Hammad £400. 
At Thursday's hearing, he was also ordered to pay a £160 surcharge and £500 towards the £1,797 it cost Trading Standards to bring the case to court.West Yorkshire Trading Standards had received “a series of complaints” about children being sold booze at the store, on Nab Wood Drive, magistrates were told.In September 2022 the business was told a test purchase was likely to take place in the near future.On May 30 2023, a Trading Standards officer attended the store, followed by a 15-year-old test purchaser.The youth was sold a 330ml bottle of the 4.5% lager without being asked for ID.Waseem Raja, prosecuting on behalf of Trading Standards, acknowledged it was a member of staff, not Hammad, who sold the alcohol, adding: “This employee hadn’t been there very long, about a week. "There had been some communication between himself and the defendant on the procedures for the sale of alcohol.”
During interview, Hammad said there had been training of staff and procedures for alcohol sales put in place, but he did not keep any records of this training.None of the usual procedures for shops which sell alcohol, such as an age verification policy, seemed to be in place, the court heard.Defending himself, Hammad said: “I make a promise – next time it won’t happen again. "It was a big mistake.”When asked about his income, he told the court the store brought in around £13,000 last year, and that he owned another store in Bradford.
