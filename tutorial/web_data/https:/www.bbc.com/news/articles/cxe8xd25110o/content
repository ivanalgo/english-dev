A project to replace facility blocks that are "nearing the end of their useful life" at a Gypsy site in Chobham is set to go ahead. Surrey County Council agreed to replace the 15 utility blocks at the Kalima Gypsy, Roma, Traveller site in Chertsey Road.Cabinet members approved the project at a meeting on Tuesday. Natalie Bramhall, cabinet member for property, waste and infrastructure, said the utility blocks helped to maintain residents' health and well being.
Council documents show there is an "urgent need to provide safe and suitable utility blocks" for the 100 people on the site, which has been there for about 30 years.The cost of the plans, which would provide purpose-built blocks with dedicated washing, cooking and toilet facilities, is not yet being made public.A planning application is due to be submitted in September and the council hopes works will be completed by January 2026.A spokesperson for Friends, Families and Travellers previously said the charity "warmly welcomed" the news.They added: "Home should be an environment that provides safety, security, and warmth."We hope these works will lead to a much-needed improvement in the quality of life for Kalima site residents."
