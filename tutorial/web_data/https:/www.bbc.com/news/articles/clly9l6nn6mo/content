More than 100 ScotRail services were cancelled on Sunday due to a dispute with staff over pay.The rail operator scrapped 101 journeys, with drivers shelving overtime and rest-day working while talks over a wage increase are ongoing.Four unions have rejected a pay offer tabled by the publicly-owned firm.A temporary timetable which was put in place in an effort to preserve reliability is likely to be in operation “for the next few weeks,” according to ScotRail’s communications director.
The operator warned music fans attending the TRNSMT festival in Glasgow on Sunday to seek “alternative means of travel” due to the reduced number of services.Aslef, Unite, RMT and TSSA staff have rejected a three-year deal backdated from April this year until 2027 which would see workers receive a 2% rise each April and a 1% increase the following January.ScotRail said it is “fully committed” to further negotiations.The firm’s service delivery director, Mark Ilderton, said: “We are sorry to customers who are experiencing disruption to services. Customers can stay up to date with the latest travel information via our ScotRail app and website.“We want to resolve the pay dispute with the trade unions and remain fully committed to further discussions.”About 1,660 trains are currently operating on the network between Monday and Saturday, with peak services on certain routes halved from four trains per hour to two.They include trains between Edinburgh and Glasgow and those between the central belt and the north.In total, about 600 services have been slashed from the ScotRail timetable under the measures.
