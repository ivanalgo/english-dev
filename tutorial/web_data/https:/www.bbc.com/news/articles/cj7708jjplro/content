An after school cafe run by young people has opened in Honiton, Devon.The Den Honiton Community Interest Company (CIC) said it was a "youth cafe with a difference".The CIC said the young people had taken on responsibility for all aspects of running the space, which is open every Wednesday and Friday 15:00-18:00 BST. The Den said the hub, on the high street, was for people aged 11 to 18 and the sessions would be supervised by adult volunteers, but run by young people.
Co-founder of The Den, Lauren Passmore-Smart, said seeing the doors open was "hugely exciting and rewarding".“We really want this to be a space driven by the young people themselves, a place to try out their ideas and learn new skills, and we are looking forward to welcoming everyone through the doors," said Ms Passmore-Smart. The Den was co-founded by Ms Passmore-Smart, Serena Sexton and Lucy Wakefield, all of whom are town councillors. The CIC said the hub had been supported by a number of organisations, including Honiton Town Council, East Devon Dance Academy, Combe Raleigh Parish Church, and Axe Vale Show.
Ms Wakefield added: “We’re hugely grateful to the local community and local businesses for all the support we have received so far. "We are always looking for more volunteers and would welcome any offers of support to help The Den reach as many young people as possible.”
