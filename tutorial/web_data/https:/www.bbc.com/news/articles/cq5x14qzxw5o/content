Self-harming incidents at Parc Prison in Bridgend have more than doubled in the last year, according to latest figures from the Ministry of Justice.There were a record 2,330 incidents in the year ending in March - up from 1,088 in 2022-23.Berwyn and Cardiff prisons also saw more self-harm incidents although there was a fall in Swansea.An HMP Parc spokesperson said self-harm incidents "have been reducing significantly" month-on-month since April, and that it was "committed to supporting the complex prisoner population" at the prison.
Overall across men's prisons in England and Wales, self-harm incidents rose by 25%, prompting one charity to call it a "crisis of human misery behind bars".There were 852 incidents of self-harm per 1,000 prisoners across men's prisons in England and Wales in 2023-24.But the self-harming rate at Parc was 1,334 incidents per 1,000 prisoners - when the expected levels might be no more than 600 per 1,000.In May, the sister of one inmate with a history of self-harm claimed he was not properly monitored before he was found dead in his cell.HMP Parc has said the death of Justin Lewis, 29, is being investigated by the prison ombudsman.Of more than 4,300 self-harm incidents across Wales, just over 100 needed hospital treatment, including 63 cases from Parc.The Bridgend prison also saw its highest inmate population since it opened in 1997 - an average 1,768 prisoners in 2023-24.However, older Welsh prisons had more overcrowding - 81% of prisoners in Usk  were in overcrowded accommodation, which was the second highest proportion in England and Wales, after Durham.The figures showed 79% of Swansea prisoners were living in overcrowded accommodation, and 63% of those in Cardiff prison.
The latest official count is that there have been 12 deaths in Parc since the start of 2024 - to the end of June - already the highest in a single year for the privately-run jail.There were two deaths from natural causes of men in their 70s in June, adding to 10 deaths reported since February.Concerns have been raised in the Senedd and the Commons in recent months about the number of deaths at the Category B prison.And Parc, Berwyn and Cardiff are all ranked "1" - of serious concern - in the latest performance measures, with regard to self-harming.It worked out that there was a self-harming incident inside a Welsh prison once every two hours.Nevertheless, overall ratings over a wide range of prison performance and management measures saw Parc, Cardiff and Swansea - all ranked "3" or good.Berwyn in Wrexham was rated "2" - of concern - for the second year since it opened in 2017.
Other figures released showed:The Howard League for Penal Reform calculated that a self-harm incident was occurring in prisons in England and Wales at a rate of one every seven minutes.Andrea Coomber, chief executive, said: "These shocking statistics tell us why the new government was absolutely right to take steps to ease pressure on the prison population, and why further action will be needed to change prisons for the better."Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board is responsible for mental health services inside Parc Prison."All incidents relating to healthcare provision, which are reported on the NHS Wales incident reporting system, are investigated and findings are shared across the prison healthcare department to ensure that lessons are learned," said a spokesperson."We are aware of some of the challenges experienced and we have an improvement programme established that we're working through."If you have been impacted by any of the issues raised in this article support is available at BBC Action Line.
