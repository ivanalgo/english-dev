An unruly caravan site plagued by guns, drugs and violent crime has been ordered to close.Crompton Lodge in Moses Gate, Bolton, will now be cleared of residents after years of problems.Bolton Council said it supported an order by Manchester Magistrates' Court to close the site for three months with residents offered temporary accommodation.It said "ongoing criminal and threatening behaviour" meant the council-owned site "was no longer safe for residents or maintenance workers".
Toilet blocks had been used to store drugs and firearms while stolen vehicles were also found, the council said.CCTV had been repeatedly damaged, a council liaison officer attacked and electricity stolen.Magistrates made the closure order last week and the council has now backed up the decision.Council leader Nick Peel said the decision had not been "taken lightly" as it was "much loved by the families who live there".“However, the overwhelming evidence presented to the court shows we had reached a point where it was no longer possible to safely maintain the site," he added.“It would have been unacceptable to continue with the site as it was, a situation which harmed tenants, local residents, and the wider traveller community.“Our focus now turns to supporting our tenants to find a new home in a safe and secure environment, while the site remains closed and secure.”
