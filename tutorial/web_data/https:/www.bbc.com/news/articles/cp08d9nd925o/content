A police officer has been nominated for a national bravery award for trying to save a  nine-year-old girl.Lilia Valutyte was fatally stabbed as she played with a hula hoop in Boston on 28 July 2022.Det Con Andy Pearson said he had done "what anyone else would do".Deividas Skebas was handed an indefinite hospital order following a trial at Lincoln Crown Court in July 2023.
Det Con Pearson had been off-duty and socialising in Boston town centre when he heard screaming coming from the incident in Fountain Lane.He told the BBC the incident was "horrendous and tragic" but went into "autopilot" when he saw what happened."Not a lot goes through your mind," he said. "I just had an overbearing desire to try and help. It's as tragic an incident as you could ever be involved with."I don't think anyone in their wildest dreams could imagine coming across something like that. I have some police training but it wasn't enough".
Det Con Pearson has served with Lincolnshire Police for 17 years and has spent his entire policing career working with communities in and around Boston.He said: "The murder of a nine-year-old girl isn't something you'd even consider or want to come across."You just don't think anything like that can happen anywhere in the world, let alone somewhere like Boston."In the nomination for the national award, officials from Lincolnshire Police and the Lincolnshire Police Federation, praised Det Con Pearson for his actions and for showing "immense bravery".Det Con Pearson said he does not consider himself to be brave.He added: "I did what everyone hopes they'd be able to do. Most importantly, what I experienced pales into insignificance compared to what Lilia's family have been through."The detective will attend the Police Bravery Awards in London on Thursday.Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
