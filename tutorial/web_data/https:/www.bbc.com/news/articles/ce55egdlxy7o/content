A rare zebra foal has been born at a wildlife park in Staffordshire for what is believed to be the first time in the UK.The maneless zebra was born at the Peak Wildlife Park in Leek on Tuesday.Classified as ‘near threatened’ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species, there are currently fewer than 40 of them living in zoos around the world, the park said."We are overjoyed to welcome this zebra foal into the Peak family," said Yaz Walker, the park's head keeper.
She added: "This birth is a testament to our dedicated efforts in conservation and our ongoing commitment to the care and preservation of endangered species."Both the newborn and its mother, Zara, are doing well while father Horus has been keeping his distance and leaving them to bond. The park’s vet and animal keeping team have been closely monitoring them to ensure their wellbeing.
