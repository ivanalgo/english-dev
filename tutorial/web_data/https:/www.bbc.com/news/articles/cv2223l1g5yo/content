People are being asked for their thoughts on shopping to help Guernsey develop a retail strategy.A survey has been launched by the Guernsey Retail Group (GRG) to find out how shoppers feel about what is on offer for them.GRG said the survey would also help explore what people would like to see in places like Town, The Bridge and St Martin in regard to hospitality and other amenities.Anyone who lives in the Bailiwick and is aged 16 or over can take part in the survey which is being run by Island Global Research.
Jonathan Creasey, GRG's chair, said Guernsey needs a retail sector that "meets the needs and expectations" of islanders in the future.Mr Creasey said: "This is an ideal opportunity for Islanders to put forward their opinions on how Town and other commercial centres can adapt in order to best meet current and future needs of local residents."Deputy Neil Inder, president of the committee for economic development, said the survey represented an "ideal opportunity" for people to have their say on developments in Town and The Bridge."We recognise the importance of a healthy, vibrant and relevant retail sector and will be interested to hear what people would like from the local shopping experience in the future", he said.
