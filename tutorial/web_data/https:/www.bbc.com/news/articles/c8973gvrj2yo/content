A council is spending Â£2.8m on infrastructure and technology changes it hopes will improve reliability of bus services in Barnstaple, Exeter and Newton Abbot.Devon County Council's (DCC) cabinet said the schemes would also cut journey times.It said the changes include improving traffic signal efficiency and introducing more message signing on busy routes.Councillor Stuart Hughes, DCC cabinet member for highway management, said it was "modernising the way it manages its highway network" in its busiest bus lanes.
He said: "Wider upgrades to our traffic control system with cameras in Exeter and Newton Abbot will help our network operations team better monitor and manage the signals when incidents occur which will benefit all road users."There will also be upgrades to variable message signing on the selected corridors in Exeter to influence driver behaviour - this may include positive messaging to encourage mode shift or alerting drivers of upcoming events or congestion."Mr Hughes said the proposals would allow DCC to "manage our highway network more intelligently".DCC said the schemes were subject to the resolution of the traffic regulation order and funding being confirmed.
