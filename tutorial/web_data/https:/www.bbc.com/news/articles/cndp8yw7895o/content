Plans to build hundreds of homes between two villages on farmland in Sussex have been submitted.The proposals for up to 1,450 homes between Ansty and Cuckfield are to be considered by Mid Sussex District Council.New schools, a sports hub, shops and community buildings are also included in the development.The site covers 100 hectares (247 acres) of mostly arable farmland with two listed buildings in the centre, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Some 30%  of the homes would be classed as affordable, the application from Fairfax Acquisitions Ltd and the Norris family said.A design statement said the development would provide "much-needed new housing, enabling young adults to stay within the vicinity".It also said accommodation would be provided for the elderly so they, too, can stay in the vicinity when they need to downsize or require additional support”.
A separate planning application is being prepared for a 103 hectare ( 254 acres) parkland reserve to the north-west of the proposed development site.If approved, the Beechy Bottom Parkland Reserve would cover farmland, woodland and grassland east of Deak’s Lane.The design statement said it would provide "a recreational benefit for the existing and new community, as well as significant biodiversity net gain".Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.
