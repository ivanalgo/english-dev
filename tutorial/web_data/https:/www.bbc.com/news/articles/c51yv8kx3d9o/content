Volunteers are set to go out litter picking and weed clearing in a bid to tidy up their area.Organiser Stu Biggs set up social media group Bridgnorth Volunteers, which has more than 90 member, and has organised the town tidy-up for Saturday.He said he wanted to try and make the Shropshire town a nicer place.Bridgnorth Town Council and Shropshire Council have been contacted for comment.
He said he thought the town looked "a mess"."When I moved here last April it was a lovely place, it was clean and tidy."Mr Biggs described the response from the Bridgnorth community as "generally pretty good.""I thought i'd put it out there and see if anyone was interested and i've had quite a decent response," he told BBC Radio Shropshire.He advised others who wanted to get involved to join the group or to attend the clean-up wearing a hi-vis jacket, after about 20 jackets were supplied by a local pub."The more people that get involved with it, the less work we've actually got to do," he added.
