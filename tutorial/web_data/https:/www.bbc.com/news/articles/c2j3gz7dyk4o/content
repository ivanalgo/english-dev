Former tannery factory workers are set to share their memories of a "forgotten history" at a Heritage Cafe reunion.The old Morlands and Baily's site on the edge of Glastonbury in Somerset, seen as both a landmark and an eyesore, has been empty since the recession of the 1980s.The monthly Catching up on Past and Present Heritage Cafe takes place in the town's Red Brick Building, originally part of the Morlands factory.Project co-ordinator Alison Horgan said she has been "bowled over" by how many people have already come forward to take part in the Somerset project.
"We’d love to hear from others and would also encourage people with a connection to Morlands or Baily’s to come along to the Heritage Café at the Red Brick Building to meet old friends and make new ones.” "In some ways this remarkable part of Glastonbury’s history has been forgotten," Ms Horgan explained."We think it is really important to honour the people who made such a huge contribution to our local community and economy and to share their stories far and wide. "The Heritage Café will also provide a valuable social focus for anyone who is interested in local heritage.”
The cafe project, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, will be held on the last Friday of each month from 27 September at the Red Brick Building.
