Drivers who transport the elderly and disabled are set to strike over what they have described as "poverty pay".About 60 Unite union members working for Greater Manchester Accessible Transport Ltd (GMAT) are to walk out from Monday 1 July to Sunday 7 July.The Ring and Ride service supports about 7,000 vulnerable people, often transporting them to vital medical appointments.A spokesperson for GMAT said an initial pay offer had been increased following discussions with Unite.
But Unite regional officer Colin Hayden said GMAT had failed to improve the pay offer to an acceptable level for what was a physically and mentally demanding job."These drivers pick up some of the most elderly and infirm in our society and our communities and take them to places where normal public transport is just not accessible to them," said Mr Hayden.He said the drivers were also carers and companions and it was "much more than being a bus driver".He said GMAT paid the lowest wages of all bus companies in the region, with drivers currently receiving £11.50 per hour.“GMAT is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and yet fails to pay its drivers rates of pay that others in the region earn," he added.Mr Hayden said the ball was firmly in GMAT's court in terms of coming back to the negotiating table with an improved offer to avert strike action.Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “GMAT should be ashamed of itself. This is a charity guilty of paying poverty wages to drivers performing a vital service to vulnerable residents across Greater Manchester." A spokesperson for GMAT said the initial pay offer of 4.35% had been increased to 6%."This offer would provide drivers with an hourly rate of £12.20 which is above the real living wage," they added.
