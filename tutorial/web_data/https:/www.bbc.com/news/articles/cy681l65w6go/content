More than 500 school uniforms are expected to be provided by a charity this summer, as it said inquiries for its services are growing.The Motherwell Community Hub has been gathering and distributing donations since lockdown. Founder Kate Blakemore said the need in Wistaston and Crewe was growing.She said more and more families were struggling with the cost of uniforms and the charity was trying to reduce inequality.Nearby schools have expressed gratitude for the work the charity does to support the community.
Motherwell Cheshire was originally established to provide accessible counselling for mothers.It has since expanded into providing support groups and a school clothes bank.“It‘s evolved and it’s about sustainability, as well. If you think all this room would probably have gone into landfill,” said the charity founder.The schools work with the charity throughout the school year by having donation stations and pop-up events to collect much needed items.
St Mary’s Catholic School headteacher Cathryn Wright said she was appreciative of the charity’s work."Motherwell is a fantastic resource. We donate a lot of uniform and other clothing," she said.At St Thomas More Catholic School one of their pupils chose Motherwell as her designated charity.Headteacher Katherine Packham said: “We supported Sophie in school by holding a year eight non-uniform day and we did a ‘just dance’ evening.”Anyone wishing to donate or make use of the service can contact the charity at their hubs on Beech Drive, YMCA Sherbourns or Wishing Well in Crewe.
