A father has paid tribute to his "inspirational" 19-year-old daughter who died from cancer months after being forced out of their flood-hit home.Emily Eden was undergoing chemotherapy in hospital when her family's house in Clay Cross, near Chesterfield in Derbyshire, was deluged with water during Storm Babet in October.She spent two months living in a hotel room before she was able to move back in time for Christmas.Ms Eden died at home on 27 May.
Mr Eden previously said his family had been "blown away" by the support they had from the Clay Cross community to help them return home.Speaking after Ms Eden's death, he said: "This was her comfort zone."She suffered from ADHD [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder] and anxiety and this was where she wanted to be - the community and contractors were amazing."After returning home, Ms Eden slept downstairs in a hospital bed in the front room.
In the final months of her life, Ms Eden underwent further chemotherapy treatment for an aggressive form of cancer in her lungs, liver and adrenal glands, and received care from Ashgate Hospice nurses.She also spent time planning her funeral, which took place at Chesterfield Crematorium on 12 June, and had chosen her coffin and songs for the service.As part of her planning, she also insisted on meeting the funeral directors.Mr Eden said: "They were gobsmacked when they came in the house and met her."They were expecting a 19-year-old cancer victim in bits but she had them laughing in minutes. That's what she was like."
Mr Eden said his daughter was determined to spend her last days at home."That was always her final wish, despite the pain," he said."She always wanted to be with her family."Mr Eden said the community would always remember his daughter, who he said "put a stamp" on people's lives."She was just a happy kid," he said. "Happy with a book, didn't need fancy things, just liked reading. She had a very inquisitive mind."Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
