A disused town centre supermarket could be turned into a drive-through coffee shop. The developer behind the plans for the former Lidl store in Longton has said a "main national operator" has already been signed up to take on the new business.The building on The Strand was last used as a charity shop, but has been empty since Mind relocated to the Longton Exchange in February. Planners at Stoke-on-Trent City Council are expected to make a decision on the proposals by 7 August.
Metalcraft Projects Limited is requesting permission to partially demolish and subdivide the building, with one half set to be turned into the drive-through and the other being retained as a retail unit.The applicant says that an occupier for the second unit has not yet been identified, but is "likely" to be a national retailer or restaurant operator. The plans would also see part of the existing car park turned into an electric vehicle charging station with 28 bays.According to the planning application, the proposed changes to the building would deliver "modern, visually attractive" commercial units, in contrast to the "dated and bland" supermarket.
