A motorway has reopened after being blocked due to a vehicle fire. The M4 in Wiltshire was shut between junction 17 (for Cirencester) and junction 18 (for Bath) for nearly four hours earlier, with heavy traffic in the area. The fire was in the westbound lane, but smoke billowing across the carriageway blocked both directions of the motorway. Wiltshire Police said no injuries had been reported and asked drivers to avoid the area. 
A spokesperson for Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service said they were called to the incident at 13:54 BST.They had three crews in attendance - two from Chippenham and one from Calne - as well as a water carrier from Royal Wootton Bassett.
