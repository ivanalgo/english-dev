Plans for a major £22m solar farm close to a village have been given the go-ahead.About 60,000 solar panels will be installed across three fields near Allington Lane in West End, Hampshire.Enough energy will be produced to power 11,000 homes, according to Eastleigh Borough Council.The authority said the project was part of a move to grow its solar power-generating portfolio.
Proposals were approved by councillors from the Hedge End, West End and Botley Local Area Committee.Eastleigh Borough Council already owns and operates Chalcroft Solar Farm in Horton Heath, along with other smaller solar-generating assets.Rupert Kyrle, the borough council's member for environment, said climate change was a significant issue that was getting worse."Clean energy will mean a more resilient supply at an affordable price,” he added.
