A man who rescues swans in Stratford-upon-Avon has said wetter winters and milder temperatures could be affecting their breeding habits.Birds have been observed nesting earlier than usual and being displaced closer to the town centre because of flooding. Cyril Bennis, who runs Stratford-upon-Avon Swan Rescue, said: "We are always on tenterhooks as to whether or not theyâ€™ll get flooded out."The rescue group said one swan had already nested and laid eggs, four weeks earlier than usual.
Avian flu wiped out more than half of the population in the area three years ago.Mr Bennis, who has spent more than 40 years looking after the local swan population, said the birds did not begin to mate until they were at least four."It's not a quick turnover," he said. "Swans need time and space."He explained one bird, which lost its mate to avian flu, had nested on the canal near to houses."It was a rather dreadful time having to take out her five cygnets and a male swan to put them to sleep because of avian flu," he said.Mr Bennis said he was keeping his fingers crossed the swan would have more cygnets this year, which "she thoroughly deserves".
High river levels and fast flowing conditions have also been limiting the operations of local boating firms in recent weeks.River levels have since fallen to expected levels, according to government floodline data.
