Baroness Foster, Northern Ireland's former First Minister, is set to be appointed chairperson of a new body to promote trade within the UK.Intertrade UK was announced in February as part of the UK government package to restore devolution.Its remit will be to encourage trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.In February, the Northern Ireland Office Minister Steve Baker said it would work to ensure "businesses large and small can maximise the full range of East-West trading opportunities."
The body is being seen as a counterweight to InterTrade Ireland, the long-established body which promotes trade across the Irish border.So far, little is known about how Intertrade UK will operate or what size its budget will be.Baroness Foster was a long serving economy minister in Northern Ireland before she became First Minister.Since she left day-to-day politics in Northern Ireland she has been best known as a presenter on GB News.
