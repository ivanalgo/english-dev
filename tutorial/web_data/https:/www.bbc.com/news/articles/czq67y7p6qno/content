An exhibition celebrating stories about nursing and the history of the profession has opened to the public.Kirkleatham Museum has collected little known stories about nursing from those doing the job across Tees Valley.Jo Hodgson, museum manager at Kirkleatham, said museums often had objects relating to nursing but there were few contemporary stories from modern nurses.She said to put this right the museum invited practising and retired nurses to "share their memories and experiences".
"Capturing these valuable experiences through oral histories means we can now preserve their voices and knowledge for generations to come," she said.Teresa Hannaway, from Eston, is one the nurses featured in the project.Ms Hannaway first discovered a love of caring for others when she volunteered at a play group for children with learning disabilities when she was 13 years old.
Over the last 10 years, she has worked with people with mental health issues and looked after adults with learning disabilities.She said those working in the field showed camaraderie, dedication and enthusiasm "in some very challenging times".
Work by photographer Chris Binns, who worked in mental health care, and artist Lucas Roy will also be on display at the museum.The pair worked with those involved in the project to try and "capture the essence" of nursing.The exhibition will also include the story of May Jacques, who set up the first cottage hospital in 1859 in North Ormesby. It was opened following the Snowdon and Hopkins Ironworks explosions, where injured men had to be treated in sheds as the nearest infirmary was in Newcastle.The exhibition is running until Sunday 15 September.
