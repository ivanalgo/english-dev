A pair of cats who gave emotional support to a D-Day veteran, then also his daughter after his death, have been nominated for a national award.Katie and Lucy were the companions of William Laing.The sibling cats moved with him into a care home, but on his death were adopted by his daughter Alyson Laing, 54, at her home in Milford, Surrey.The cats, now aged 18, have been nominated in the 2024 Cats Protection National Awards.
Ms Laing said: “Mum and dad were great cat lovers and Katie and Lucy fantastic companions in their retirement. When mum died in 2018, they were such a comfort to dad, never leaving his side.“A year later, shortly after meeting Prince William at the 75th anniversary D-Day commemorations, dad, aged 92, moved to a care home. He said he wasn’t going without his cats so they spent his final two months with him.“Having Katie and Lucy to share my grief with was a real solace. They helped through several painful knee surgeries, bringing garden flowers they’d picked through the cat flap for me."
The cats have also dealt with their own health issues."As kittens they were both in hospital for two weeks with an infection. Then Lucy broke her tail so it had a kink in it," said Ms Laing."In 2023 vets removed her tail due to an infected cyst. She’s clumsier now but potters about contentedly."Katie has arthritis but still dive bombs into garden hedges. They make me smile every day. I tell them dad is looking down, happy we are together.”The winners of the contest will be decided by a public vote.
