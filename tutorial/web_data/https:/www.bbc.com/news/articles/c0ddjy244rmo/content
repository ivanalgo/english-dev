A mural of a football journalist who suffered a fatal cardiac arrest has been unveiled.Jenny Kerwood was just 22 years old when she collapsed during a football training session and died on her way to hospital in February 2012.It was later discovered Ms Kerwood, from Billericay in Essex, had a rare congenital heart condition.The poignant artwork, now on display in Edmonton, north London, was put together by the British Heart Foundation to raise awareness about heart disease.
Ms Kerwood had just graduated from Westminster University and started working for a football news website reporting on Leyton Orient when she died.
Her brother, Ross, was studying when he was contacted by one of his sister's teammates."When she told me what had happened, I was completely taken aback. I’d only spoken to her the day before," he said.Mr Kerwood, 31, said his dad had to break the news to him that his sister had died in the ambulance on the way to hospital.“I remember just being hit by pure grief and crying uncontrollably," he said. "It took me about three years to even begin to process my grief. "I was only 19 at the time and I just remember thinking 'this shouldn’t be happening, I shouldn’t be having to grieve for my sister'."
It was discovered that Ms Kerwood had Bland-White-Garland syndrome, a rare heart condition that affects one in every 300,000 live births. Apart from occasionally becoming out of breath during vigorous exercise, she never showed any symptoms.The British Heart Foundation said the mural was unveiled to coincide with the start of UEFA Euro 2024.Mr Kerwood added: "Since Jenny’s death, it’s really bittersweet seeing how women’s football has become so high profile – especially with The Lionesses. "You’re really happy because you feel she’s being represented in some way, but also really sad that she’s not here to witness it.”
