Yorkshire Water says it is investing £6m in a "major development" to improve water quality and resilience in Howden and Howdendyke.The company said it was ahead of a "major expansion" of the town, including the building of 1,900 new homes. The work involves building a new water main underneath the M62 and a storage tank to hold excess storm water. Construction is due to begin on Monday 22 July and has an estimated completion date of December. 
In June 2023, plans were approved to almost double the size of Howden by building almost 2,000 homes.The plans include a new relief road, as well as a school, pub, supermarket and medical centre, and an additional factory for Howdens Joinery.Applicants JG Hatcliffe and Howden Joinery Properties Ltd said the plans would "create a desirable place that will stand the test of time and that people will be proud of and want to inhabit for many years to come".Work on the relief road, to divert some traffic away from the town centre, has begun and is expected to be finished in 2027. 
The work by Yorkshire Water involves installing a new 1.9 mile (3km) water main between Howden Broad Lane Sewage Pumping Station and Howden Wastewater Treatment Works at Howdendyke. A new 880,000 gallon (4,000 cubic-metre) storage tank will be installed to increase capacity at the wastewater treatment works. The company said this would hold excess storm water in the event of heavy or prolonged rainfall and help to improve water quality.Yorkshire Water's project manager Sarah Albone said: “This significant investment will provide increased capacity to the existing network and is an important part of our commitment to environmental performance and improving river quality.“It sets a solid foundation for phase two, working alongside the large-scale development plan that can potentially double the size of the town, ensuring the correct infrastructure is already in place to enable Yorkshire Water to prepare for the expansion.”Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
