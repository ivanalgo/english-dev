Hotels and guest houses in a popular tourist area have been visited by fire safety inspectors ahead of the busy summer season.Inspectors from Hampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service (HIWFRS) have visited venues across the Isle of Wight.They worked with business owners to ensure all premises they visited met the latest fire safety regulations.HIWFRS said the visits would help "ensure the safety of holidaymakers and staff".
The visits took place ahead of the busy tourist season, that will see tourists flock to the island for holidays.Station manager responsible for protection at the service Simon Whelan said: “The holiday season is a particularly busy time on the island and we want businesses to know that we are here to support them and offer advice and guidance so they can ensure their hotels and guest houses are as safe as possible for their customers.“Fire can have a devastating impact on businesses so it’s vital that risk assessments are regularly reviewed and updated to increase fire safety."New legislation implemented in 2023 means all businesses are required to keep risk assessments and safety arrangements in full.This includes owners of holiday rental properties.Mr Whelan said the service's “dedicated team" of fire safety inspectors had been working "closely with all business owners" to help them maintain compliance with the new legislation."We are an empowering organisation that will always be happy to assist business owners to do the right thing,” he added.
