The family of a three-year-old girl who died after being hit by a car in Fife have settled a civil action against the driver.Robyn Knox was critically injured by a blue Nissan Micra in Townhill, near Dunfermline, in August 2020.The toddler died a short time later in the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy.The driver was never prosecuted but civil action was raised by Robyn's family.But the case has now settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.Robyn's parents Danielle Falconer and Barry Knox previously said their daughter was "the best thing to happen to both of us".They couple added she was a "loving, kind, gentle and caring wee soul".
Innes Laing, a partner at legal firm Digby Brown in Kirkcaldy, said: "No parent expects to lose a child and I sincerely commend Robyn’s family for their consistent dignity, strength and unity."I think it’s important to note, as many people will empathise, that no one ever wants to be in this position."Everyone knows compensation will never replace a loved one but what a civil case can do is help provide answers to the many questions families have after a fatal accident - especially if the authorities took no further action, leaving bereaved families feeling like they have nowhere else to go for help."
At the time primary school teacher Ms Falconer said she was "genuinely broken" by the loss of her daughter.The family shared Robyn's love for freestyle dance and her excitement for becoming a big sister to twin siblings later that year.Ms Falconer added: "Our baby was so unbelievably loved by everyone and will continue to be loved for the rest of time."In a joint statement the couple said their lives had been "shattered into a million pieces".It continued: "Her sassy attitude made her into the little diva, it provided her with so much personality and confidence."She was the strongest little person we ever met, right until the very last second."We hope we can carry that strength with us."
