Young people have been creating a documentary about the problems of homelessness and addiction in their home town.Ipswich has a beautiful waterfront and a vibrant arts and music scene, but also social problems and issues with drug-related gang violence.The youth charity Inspire runs the Prince's Trust Team programme, a 12-week course which includes developing a project to benefit the local community.Kayley Caldwell, 21, said: "We have been filming different locations where there's homeless people and places where they help with mental health [issues] and we've been filming things about addiction."
The Team programme is for 16-25 years old who are not in employment, education or training.For their documentary, the group visited a church-run top-up-shop and Ipswich YMCA, which provides accommodation and support.Ink Roberts, 18, feels it is important to highlight the positive work happening, as well as the problems in the town."I feel like more people can play their part, but it is working and more people are starting to become aware of the situation, which is shedding light on things which otherwise wouldn't be noticed," she said.
Ink and Kayley are also working a community mural the group is creating.Ink said: "We originally planned to paint our design on a wall in Ipswich but we couldn’t get permission for a wall so we decided to switch to a canvas. "The colours on the design represent struggles people have faced through mental health and addiction issues. "Red relates to self-harm, and orange to anxiety. "We will donate the finished canvas to the YMCA who feature on our documentary.”
