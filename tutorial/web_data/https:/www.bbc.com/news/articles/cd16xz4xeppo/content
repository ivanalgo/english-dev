The mother of a woman who was murdered in 1997 has called her killer's parole hearing "a farce". Farm worker Steven Ling was jailed for life in December 1998, after he admitted murdering 29 year-old Joanne Tulip in Stamfordham, Northumberland.But Ling was allowed to give evidence in private at a parole hearing, even though an application had been been granted for it to be held in public.Ms Tulip's mother, Doreen Soulsby, said: "It's not a public hearing, the expectation was that we'd hear something from the offender, and we got nothing."
She added: "So he has rights, he has a right not to be on camera if he doesn't want to speak, it's the offender who's in control."
In April 2023, Caroline Corby, the chairwoman of the Parole Board, granted an application for Ling's fifth parole hearing to be held in public.But on the first day of proceedings, the panel chair said Ling's evidence would be heard in private "to ensure the panel could make a fair and informed decision based on the risk he presents to the public".A Parole Board spokesperson said in a statement: "We are very sorry that the victims are unable to observe all of the proceedings and understand the impact that this has had on them and their understanding of the process."
Mrs Soulsby said she had applied for the public hearing because she wanted to see Ling "face the public and what he's done"."But of course we've never even seen him or heard him, not even confirming his name, I was just exhausted and drained," she said. "There's no consideration for victims at all."Two psychologists have already told the parole hearing they are recommending he be released on a risk management programme something Mrs Soulsby has described as "a nightmare".  Ling's community offender manager told the panel his recommendation would be to move the convicted killer to open conditions, not to direct his release from prison.The hearing has finished hearing oral evidence and counsel for the Secretary of State, and for Ling, will give closing submissions in writing.The panel will publish a decision at a later date, likely to be about four weeks from now.
