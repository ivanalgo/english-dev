Management of the Bradford Live project has been called a "secretive farce" by councillors who have questioned the use of public money.The restoration of the former Odeon cinema as a 3,800-seat venue has been completed but contracted operator NEC Group has failed to confirm it will run it.The council this week said that the initial £25m cost of the project had now soared to a projected £50m.Council opposition leader and Liberal Democrat councillor Brendan Stubbs criticised a "lack of transparency" around the venue.
The building is owned by a company called Bradford Live, which is in turn controlled by the council.Announcing the "practical completion" of the site this week, Bradford Live director Lee Craven said: "We've battled tough challenges for over three years, but the restored venue justifies all the hardship."We've worked closely with Bradford Council throughout the works and would like to thank them for their unwavering support and commitment."
Two scheduled shows at the venue have already been cancelled with tickets refunded. The NEC Group has not responded to queries.Responding to the announcement that construction had finished, Mr Stubbs said: "The silence over NEC involvement has cast a long shadow over this scheme."Residents and taxpayers deserve much better. "When you spend tens of millions of pounds on a project, that needs to be open and transparent. "What should have been a huge success for the city has become a secretive farce that is no good for anyone." He added: "I hope it is successful and offers real benefit to businesses in the city centre too, but at a time when basic services are failing it doesn't seem to many as a wise use of limited public funds."
Councillor Alex Ross-Shaw, who also serves as a director of Bradford Live, said the renovation had given the building an "exciting future" and that it would play a key role in the regeneration of the city centre.Bradford Council said the cost of the scheme had risen to £50.5m, of which £43.75m was from its own funds and the remainder from West Yorkshire Combined Authority, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and The National Lottery Heritage Fund.The legal process of handing over the building from the contractors to the NEC Group has now begun.NEC was asked by the BBC when shows will start and if it will honour its contract with Bradford Live, but did not respond.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
