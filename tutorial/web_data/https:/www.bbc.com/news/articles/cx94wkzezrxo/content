Crawley Borough Council has been joined by nine other South East local authorities in submitting concerns to a government appointed panel about Gatwick Airport's plans to bring its emergency runway into regular use.Under the airport's Northern Runway plans, the emergency runway would be used only for departing flights.The group of councils raised concerns about "the ability of the airport to operate within acceptable and enforceable limits without causing health and environmental harm."The £2.2bn proposal has previously drawn criticism from campaigners.
Should the proposals be approved, Gatwick Airport has said that construction could start in 2025 and be completed and ready for operational use by the end of the decade.During a meeting of Crawley Borough Council’s planning committee, it was agreed to submit a holding objection to the plans – one which could be changed should the airport address the concerns raised.A spokesman said: “Gatwick Airport is a huge economic asset for the town.  “However, we have a wide range of concerns with the airport’s Northern Runway Project, including the uncertainty regarding future economic benefits for residents, the airport’s ability to operate within acceptable and enforceable limits without causing environmental harm, the impacts of construction, air quality, traffic and a lack of active travel solutions.”
The other nine authorities who issued a joint statement with Crawley were:The group said they "want to ensure that the economic benefits that could arise from the project are secured for the areas surrounding Gatwick Airport and that growth does not give rise to negative impacts on employment, housing, and local services.”
