A nurse accused of lying about her qualifications to get a senior role did not mention during 35 hours of interviews claims she later made in court that staff were bullied on the ward.Tanya Nasir, 45 from Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, said a "matriarch" of senior staff held power at the neonatal unit at the Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend.Hospital managers were not interested in her concerns about the treatment of junior nurses, or about racist comments she said had been directed at her, she told Cardiff Crown Court.Ms Nasir denies nine counts of fraud and fraud by false representation, after she was accused of making up qualifications and creating fictitious references to get jobs at Hillingdon Hospital in London, as well as the Bridgend hospital.
She said she was suspended two days after requesting a meeting with bosses about the bullying allegations.But the jury was told the first time Ms Nasir mentioned the claims was in the witness box.The court has previously been told Ms Nasir claimed to have served with the Army Reserves as a combat medic and volunteer in Afghanistan, Iraq and Sudan in conjunction with major humanitarian charities.She told the hospital she would need time off to attend Army training camps.But the Army and Army Reserve said she did not serve, and charities including Oxfam and the Red Cross said there is no record of her working with them.Ms Nasir was interviewed on six separate occasions by NHS counter-fraud investigators at Brecon police station.She told the court there was no opportunity to talk about the problems on the unit or her attempts to alert senior staff under the hospital's whistleblowing policy."It was all one way over the 35 hours. It was not a conversation, I had to answer their questions. Those interviewing me did not let me discuss it,” she said.
Emma Harris, prosecuting, said: "You could have suggested there was an issue with bullying, but you didn't."You are intent to blacken the names and the reputations of the people who uncovered your lies."The court heard letters were found at Ms Nasir’s house, addressed to Dr Nasir and Capt Nasir.Ms Harris said: "You frequently misrepresent your qualifications and your titles."Ms Nasir replied:  "I do not."Ms Harris added: "You have never been a captain."Ms Nasir responded:  "I have never been a captain, I have never taken a commission."I have never been a doctor. I am a nurse.”Ms Nasir was suspended from her post as the band seven ward manager on the neonatal ward at the Princess of Wales Hospital in February 2020 after concerns were raised by the neonatal matron Sian Townsend about the real date of her registratrion as a qualified nurse.She resigned two days before a disciplinary hearing in November that year.The trial continues.
