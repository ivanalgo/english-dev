An elderly care home resident has received close to 900 cards after a public appeal was launched to help her celebrate her 107th birthday.Joyce Jones, who was born in 1917 in Somerset, celebrated the milestone birthday on 8 July at Kingswood Court Care Home in Bristol.The team taking care of Ms Jones wanted her to have a card for every year of her life so they asked the public to send in as many as possible.Ms Jones said: "I’ve got lots to be thankful for." 
Sharing her wisdom with the younger generation, Ms Jones said the secret to a long life was "hard work and good living".She added: “I’ve done remarkably well to be here. There aren’t many that would make it, I suppose."I’m happy here and they’re all good to me so I’ve got lots to be thankful for."Friends, family and staff gathered to celebrate with a high tea at the home which had been adorned with the cards, banners and more than 500 balloons.
"We've got 861 cards and I reckon there's still more to come," said activities assistant Sarah Walton."Joyce is an amazing lady. She is the life and soul of Kingswood Court. "We've got the utmost respect for Joyce. To reach this age is incredible." Ms Walton said Ms Jones had been counting down the days until her birthday but that the birthday wishes flooding through the letterbox came as a "complete surprise" to her.  
"She knew nothing about it," Ms Walton said."She knew she was having a party, and she was excited, but when she came down this morning she said 'oh my goodness, are they all for me?'" "It really is amazing," added care assistant Julie Bird."But then, she's an amazing lady and she deserves it. She's a very special person who makes our days worthwhile."
