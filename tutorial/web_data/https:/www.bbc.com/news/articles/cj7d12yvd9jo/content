An MP hopes to make a care home's owners reconsider their plans to close a site in Cornwall.Jayne Kirkham, who became Labour's MP for Truro and Falmouth after the general election on 4 July, said the Roseland Parc site in Tregony was at the "heart of the community".Her comments came after the home's owners Retirement Villages Group (RVG) said it was going to close the care home.Ms Kirkham spoke to residents and staff at the home and said she hoped to get RVG to consider other options.
Ms Kirkham said she felt the decision to close the property, which houses more than 30 residents and about 45 staff, was not the right move as she has been told the home was profitable.She said she planned to meet with RVG bosses on Monday to discuss the plans."As the MP, I'm hoping my voice will add weight to the argument of the local community and the people who are running the care home successfully," Ms Kirkham said."I am intending to meet with the company on Monday and talk to them about this and really push the case for the people of Tregony."
Ms Kirkham said ultimately as it was a privately owned business, there was little control the authorities could have on keeping it open as long as it was done legally.However, she wanted to add her voice to those concerned about the closure plans and hoped the care home would stay open.Ms Kirkham said: "It's at the heart of the community and it's really important for the place that it stays here."
During its announcement about closing the home earlier this week, RVG said the move would  "enable investment" and the provision of additional supported, independent living for retired people.RVG commercial and property services director Nick Jones said the company knew it was "upsetting" and "difficult" news for residents, family members and employees.A statement from the company added it was working with Cornwall Council and other partners to find alternative care for those impacted by the closure.
