An 84-year-old swimming teacher who has no plans to retire has encouraged other people her age to keep active.Barbara Vincent started her teaching career in 1986 and has taught at Westminster Lodge in St Albans for most of the past four decades.She hoped she could encourage other older people to keep active."You're as old as you feel," she said. "If you feel you'd like to have a go and you have the mind to do it, then you have nothing to lose by giving it a try."
She added: “Doing regular exercise and keeping my mind stimulated means even though I’m now 84, I still have no plans to retire. "I consider myself very fortunate to be able to do a job I love so much whilst still positively impacting little ones’ lives.”Ms Vincent comes from a background in advertising and was inspired to become a teacher when her sons were having regular swimming lessons.She began talking to the teachers who encouraged her to get qualified and teach herself.Hollie Burke, swim manager at Westminster Lodge Leisure Centre, said: “Barbara is an incredibly passionate teacher and has taught multiple generations at our centre. "Not only has she taught our current swimming pupils since they were tiny, but many of our current swim teachers have also been taught by her.“She absolutely epitomises the phrase that age is just a number and is arguably one of our most active teachers on the poolside."
