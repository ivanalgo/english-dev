A teacher said a university's careers event for children had "really opened their minds to the possibilities".The University of Northampton said almost 3,000 pupils came to its STEAM Northants day.They were able to see a land speed record car, experience a 3D planetarium and watch a surgical operation.Some children said the event had changed their view of certain professions.
More than 45 schools and colleges were represented at the event, which covered careers in science, technology, engineering, arts and maths - collectively known by the acronym, Steam.Among the displays were the Bloodhound land speed record car and 3D planetariums in the university's sports dome.
Jo Robinson, a trainee teacher at Lyncrest Primary School, said her children had a strong reaction to a video at the Medical Mavericks exhibit showing a patient undergoing a gastroscopy as a camera was inserted into their nose and down into their lungs.She added: "They learned about taking a pulse and taking an EGC and that it's not just doctors and nurses, there's also scientists who analyse the result and there's hundreds of jobs in health."Today has really opened their minds to the possibilities and encouraged them to concentrate on maths, English and science."
Dylan, who is 11, said: "I didnâ€™t know what to expect, but I've seen the gaming area and the animal area."I don't know what I want to do when I leave school, but I do like engineering and science, so everything here has been really interesting."Eve, also 11, completed the British Army's climbing wall challenge and said: "I've seen loads - dead bugs [and] virtual reality - but I really like music and the performance zone."I've thought about being an author when I leave school, but the Medical Mavericks caught my eye, especially the bit about being an optician."
