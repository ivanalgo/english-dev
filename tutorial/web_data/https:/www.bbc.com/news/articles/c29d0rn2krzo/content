New measures are being brought in to tackle a town's problem landlords and tenants.Extra powers have been granted in two areas of Blyth to deal with poor quality housing and anti-social behaviour.It requires all landlords in the Croft and Cowpen wards to apply for a licence before they are able to rent out their property, Northumberland County Council said.Deputy council leader Richard Wearmouth said some residents made life "hell" for the town’s law-abiding population.
The Conservative-led authority approved a selective licensing scheme, which is used by councils to tackle private landlords who are not meeting their legal obligations, alongside tenants engaging in anti-social behaviour.Local authorities including Durham and Newcastle also have the scheme, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Council leader Glen Sanderson said: "Being a bad landlord can extend to tenancy management."The council will not stand by and allow residents to live in properties of low standards. "When landlords don’t obtain references allowing a culture of anti-social behaviour - this will tackle that."
The report said there was a "clear link" between poor housing and inequalities - with people living in poor quality homes twice as likely to have poor general health than those who do not.Men living in the Croft ward have the lowest life expectancy and healthy life expectancy in the county, while Cowpen has the lowest figures for women.Mr Wearmouth said problem landlords and tenants needed to be tackled as part of the town's regeneration or "we put everything that we seek to achieve at risk"."It's a very small handful of people who make life hell, not just for neighbours on their street, but also in terms of their behaviour when they spend time in the town centre," he added.It is hoped by the third year of the scheme, there will be a reduction in property disrepair, anti-social behaviour and crime, contributing to reducing deprivation in the area.
