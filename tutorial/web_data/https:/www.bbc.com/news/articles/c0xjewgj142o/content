Planning costs for Alderney Airport's runway extension have risen above £1m according to the government body responsible for Guernsey's ports and airline.The States Trading Supervisory Board (STSB) said £1.15m had been spent out of a budget of £1.76m.The news comes after the estimated cost of building the extension rose by 50% to £37m earlier this month.Deputy Peter Roffey, STSB president, said the remaining budget was "sufficient" to find a "smaller scale and more affordable solution".
Mr Roffey said the money spent so far had gone on technical advice, project management, design work and ground and environmental surveys.
