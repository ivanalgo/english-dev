Passengers are being advised to check their journeys before they travel this weekend in London due to disruption and possible station closures.Transport for London (TfL) said several events were taking place over the weekend including the Pride parade on Saturday, meaning "services and stations in central London will be particularly busy and people may need to queue before being able to board a train".It said some stations may become exit-only on Saturday and some bus routes in central London would also be on diversion or stopping short of their usual destination due to road closures.TfL added Oxford Circus Tube station may also close at short notice on Friday and Saturday due to industrial action - but it did not give further details of what action this is.
