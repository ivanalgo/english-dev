Former Conservative MP Sir Michael Fabricant said he understood why his party did not inspire confidence with voters in the general election.Sir Michael failed to be re-elected as MP for Lichfield where he had been an MP since 1992, losing to Labour's Dave Robertson by 810 votes.In an interview after his tenure as an MP ended, Fabricant said party infighting and a quick succession of prime ministers over the last few years had not inspired confidence with the electorate."I'm obviously disappointed but I suspected it might happen," the 74-year-old told the BBC.
"Firstly, there were huge national swings [that] worked against Conservative candidates. I mean, I don't want to make excuses, but I will."Sir Michael lost a 30% share in the vote compared to 2019 when he won with a majority of more than 22,000.He claimed tactical voting was another reason for his loss, citing the performance of Reform UK during the election.Overall, his party suffered a huge general election defeat - the worst in its parliamentary history
"All governments in power are unpopular because of the cost of fuel and inflation and everything caused by the money spent on Covid, furlough, and also because of the war in Ukraine," he added."Of course the Conservative Party hasn't helped itself by constantly fighting amongst itself over the last few years, and the succession of prime ministers didn't inspire confidence with the electorate, so I understand why they felt that way. "So I like to think it's not a personal referendum on my performance as an MP but rather the failure I think of the last few years of the Conservative government."However the former MP was gracious in defeat, calling Dave Robertson a "decent guy" who he was sure would do his best to represent the constituency."Because I want him to do well, for the people of the constituency who've elected me all over these years, I wish him well," Sir Michael said.
Sir Michael was MP for the area since 1992 when he represented Mid Staffordshire before it was abolished under a boundary review and he became the MP for Lichfield in 1997.Known for his trademark blond locks, the subject of much speculation, as an MP he was known for his colourful personality and fondness for eye-catching stunts.They included once filming himself cycling naked around a park in London, to promote the creation of a charity naked bike ride in Lichfield.In 2022, he apologised for suggesting teachers and nurses enjoyed a "quiet drink" in staff rooms during lockdown.Sir Michael made the comment during a BBC interview where he said he did not believe then prime minister Boris Johnson knew he was breaking the law when he attended a gathering in Downing Street in June 2020 to celebrate his 56th birthday.He was given a knighthood in the former prime minister's resignation honours list.
Reflecting on the highlights of his career, Sir Michael said he was proud to have helped save the National Memorial Arboretum when it had financial difficulties.He recounted, while he was in opposition, persuading a Labour minister to write off a huge debt in VAT which he said would have bankrupted them.Sir Michael also said he was proud to have persuaded the RAF to take on a young female constituent whose father had a hereditary disease.Despite having lost his seat, he said he would not be leaving the area: "I hope Lichfield people will remember me with affection."Looking to the future, the former MP added: "Someone has suggested I do Strictly Come Dancing but I'm not too sure!"
