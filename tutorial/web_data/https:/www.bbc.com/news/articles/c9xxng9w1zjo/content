"The girls had to make the best of a bad situation. They are pulling together, there is no moaning and they are doing what they can to achieve our goals," he said.Other teams in the race jumped in to help the team reach the start line."I reached out to the other team managers, and within five to 10 minutes I had offers of five, six, or seven bikes."Mr Varney said that other mechanics stepped in to help the riders set the bikes up."We're riding other people's bikes, but the girls are there and ready to fight," he added.Macdonald Hotels & Resorts said it was aware of the incident. "As this is a police matter and investigations are ongoing, we are unable to comment further," a spokesperson added.
