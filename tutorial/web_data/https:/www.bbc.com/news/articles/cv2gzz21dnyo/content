BBC Cardiff Singer of the World has been postponed until 2027 while its usual city centre venue, St David's Hall, remains closed. The competition will instead stage a gala concert in October 2025 as part of the Wales Millennium Centre's Llais international music festival in Cardiff.It will feature previous winners and competitors from the show.Rhuanedd Richards, director of BBC Cymru Wales, said: "This gala concert is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate some of the exceptional voices to emerge from this competition.
"Iâ€™m delighted to be working with the dynamic and creative team at Llais Festival and look forward to a night to remember at the Wales Millennium Centre."Cardiff Singer of the World is usually held every two years, with the most recent  competition in 2023.St David's Hall closed in September 2023 after an inspection found that the roof could collapse. This was due to reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) in the roof.In a post on X in November 2023, the hall said it would be closed for at least 18 months.The gala concert will be recorded and shown on BBC Four and BBC Two Wales later in the year.
