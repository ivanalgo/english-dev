A school has gone ahead with a pupil visit to Wales’ largest theme park a day after thrill seekers were injured on sudden-drop ride Bounce.The attraction, at Oakwood, Pembrokeshire, performed an emergency stop mid-fall, said the park, which is holding an internal investigation. The ride was closed after a number of visitors reported back pain and were seen by first aiders.Milford Haven School said on Facebook that any parents or carers who did not want pupils to go on the trip could remove consent.
The school also said there had been an updated risk assessment and if the ride had reopened, no pupils would have allowed on it - although in fact it remained closed all day.Pembrokeshire council said organising trips was down to schools.“Senior school leaders will take the decision on whether trips go ahead based on the information available,” it added.Member of the Senedd (MS) Sam Kurtz has written to Oakwood demanding a “full investigation”.Mr Kurtz, who represents Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, also wants safety checks on all other rides.He said: “It is important that yesterday’s incident is fully investigated and issues rectified as a matter of urgency.”Mid and South Pembrokeshire’s new MP, Henry Tufnell, also wants an inquiry and said it was "deeply concerning”.The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said it was making inquiries.
Oakwood said: "Our ride engineering team attended the ride immediately, and completed the manual controlled lowering procedure enabling all guests to disembark."As is always the case in such an occurrence, we have consulted with the ride control system manufacturer, who are attending site today."We have temporarily closed Bounce to enable them to complete their works, and to aid our internal investigation. Our other rides remain open."Bounce was initially shut in 2016 and was supposed to reopen in 2019 following a £400,000 refurbishment.However, the onset of the pandemic saw its reopening delayed until 2022.The attraction is described on Oakwood's website as "a gravity-defying, stomach-lurching shot ‘n’ drop tower ride".
Oakwood also hit the headlines in October 2022 when a man had to be hospitalised following an incident on its Treetops rollercoaster.Eyewitnesses reported seeing him fall out of a carriage to the ground, which led to the park temporarily closing.But the HSE said its examiners found no fault with any of the ride's equipment and no action was taken against the park.In April 2004, Hayley Williams, 16, from Pontypool, died after falling 100ft (30.48m) from Oakwood's Hydro Ride.Her family called for tighter safety regulations at theme parks as a result of her death.
