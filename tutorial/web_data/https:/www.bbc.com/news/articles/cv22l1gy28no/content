A 1930 theatre which became a bingo hall is now set to revert to being a live music venue.The Adelphi Theatre on Bath Road in Slough, had previously featured performances from The Beatles, Roy Orbison and Jimi Hendrix.Since 1973 the site had been a bingo hall, until Buzz Bingo closed in April 2023.A post on social media from Buzz Bingo said: “We’re so sad to say goodbye but so grateful for all your support."
The Adelphi was bought by the council for £4.6 million in 2018, but was sold off in January last year to ease the council’s debt pressures.The new owner of The Adelphi wants to bring its performing pedigree back by renaming it the Crystal Grand and launching a bid to host live music inside.A businessman has applied to hold live music at the theatre from 9:00 to 23:00 GMT every day, with recorded music until 01:00 each night.He has also applied to sell alcohol until 00.30 every night, and serve food.Permission has been submitted in a licensing application to Slough Borough Council.Anyone can comment on the application by emailing or writing to the council by Tuesday 2 July.
