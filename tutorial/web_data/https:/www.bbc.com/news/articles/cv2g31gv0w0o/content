Plans for a new development on an army base with the potential to create 2,000 new homes could see a rural community double in size.Swanton Morley Parish Council has backed proposals for Robertson Barracks, near Dereham, which is home to the 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards, to be transformed into a self-sustaining neighbourhood. The 165-hectare military base has been earmarked as part of Breckland Council's local plan for the next 20 years. Roger Atterwill, chairman of Swanton Morley Parish Council, said: "We are aware that this brownfield site could be utilised by the government for prison or immigration purposes but we feel that it has a lot of potential for both housing and employment growth."
If approved the plans would see the population of Swanton Morley, which is about 2,200 people, more than double. There are about 400 personnel based at the military site and troops will relocate to Wales from 2028 and the Ministry of Defence plans to dispose of the site by 2029. Mr Atterwill said the parish council will work with the Defence Infrastructure Organisation and Breckland Council. While he says there is "justifiable concerns" over the size of the proposals, he has asked people to consider the potential benefits it could bring to the area. “This could be an opportunity to bring considerable local investment, employment and improvements to services, such as buses and healthcare,” he added.The development is part of Breckland Council’s wider plans to build thousands of new homes across the district, including sites in Attleborough, Swaffham and Thetford.
