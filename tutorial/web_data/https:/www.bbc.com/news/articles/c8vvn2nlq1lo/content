On the car-free island of Sark, bicycles and tractors are the go-to mode of transport - except for Sundays when tractors are not allowed to be driven.But now a group of politicians on the tiny Channel Island with a population of about 580 are trying to change that, arguing Sunday is no longer considered a day of rest.The move has sparked a row among residents - including one dubbed "The King of Sark" - who want to preserve the tradition.Others argue times have changed and Sark needs to adapt.
The proposition to change the law has been submitted by members of the Douzaine, the body which looks after roads on the island, to be considered by the Chief Pleas in early July.At the moment, tractors are the only motor vehicles which may be driven on the island - but their use is restricted to six days of the week.Some people, however, have special permission to drive their tractor seven days a week.Members of Sark's government have asked for the law to be changed so all tractors may be driven at any time.
In the proposition submitted by Conseiller Chris Bateson, chairman of the Douzaine, he wrote that "there has been a gradual shift from the notion of 'keeping Sunday special' to it becoming 'just another working day'".His opinion was echoed by Bernadette Southern, chef at restaurant Fleur du Jardin, who said: "It's totally different to what it was years ago, when Sunday was a relaxing day."She also said the summer season was now so short it was "essential" farmers and other people who needed tractors should be able to use them seven days a week.She said: "The boats change through the winter, so there aren't the same number of tourists. Everybody needs to make their money through the summertime. "Times really do need to change. I think everything else is changing so this needs to change too."
However, Jason Salisbury, of Sark Dairy, said he believed the law should remain as it was, saying it was a selling point for tourists that the island was traffic-free, and that keeping one day a week with minimal tractor movement would "keep Sark special".He said he did not want to work on Sundays despite working in agriculture.He said: "If you can't organise yourself not to try during a particular time, then you need to sort it out."As a compromise, Mr Salisbury suggested restricting tractors between 10:00 and 15:00, except for emergency services.
Peter Plummer, nicknamed the King of Sark, drives the tractor-towed bus service, known locally as the "toast rack" because of the shape of its passenger-carrying trailer, taking visitors up and down Harbour Hill on arrival and when leaving the island.He holds special permission to drive his vehicle seven days a week and said he did not think the rule should be changed to allow everyone to do the same."If the rule is changed, I think people will take it for granted. "It's a slippery slope - at what point do you say no?"He said that, despite dwindling summer seasons, allowing more tractor movement, and with it more dust and noise, would hurt the tourist economy rather than help it.
The proposition will be considered at the midsummer Chief Pleas on 3 July.The report was originally on the agenda of the easter meeting of Chief Pleas but, owing to a vote of no confidence in the Douzaine, it was withdrawn.The Douzaine discussed the report and decided to resubmit it and allow Chief Pleas to decide on the matter.Conseiller Chris Bateson said: "The Douzaine is aware that the subject of Sunday tractors is a contentious matter and hopes that Sark residents make their feelings known to both the committee and conseillers in general."
