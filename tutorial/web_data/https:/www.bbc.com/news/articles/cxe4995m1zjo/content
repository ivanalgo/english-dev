A shake-up of parking fees in parts of Cheshire would not bring in the required savings and further measures such as ending cash payments could be needed, according to a new report.Cheshire East Council had launched a review of parking to raise funds and provide more consistency in costs across the borough.Residents had raised concerns about the impact on town and village centres.But the measures recommended in a council report would still lead to a shortfall of about £800,000 and further changes such as cashless parking and charges on evenings and Sundays could be considered.
Cheshire East Council, which has been facing financial pressures, operates 111 car parks across the borough. Many areas historically have had free parking, as a result of arrangements before the council’s formation in 2009.A consultation on parking changes led to protests.According to the council report, 96% of the 8,384 responses to the consultation were against the proposals.Under the proposals to be discussed by councillors, parking charges are set to come into force in Alsager, Audlem, Bollington, Handforth, Holmes Chapel, Middlewich, Poynton and Prestbury.Some smaller car parks in Haslington, Shavington and Alsager would remain free, while car parks in some areas would be free after 15:00 to support school pick-ups. 
Processing cash payments currently costs the council £65,000 a year and taking into account the extra parking meters planned, swapping to all card payments could save the council £100,000 a year, the report said.Other measures include scrapping parking charge refunds for users of leisure centres in Crewe and Nantwich.Demand-responsive parking is also set to be introduced at the Royal Arcade multi-storey car park in Crewe, which is currently under construction.In other areas, the approach has seen fees rise at busier times of the day.Similar schemes could come into force in Macclesfield and Wilmslow.Craig Browne, deputy leader of the council, said: "Doing nothing and sticking with the same parking regime is not only something that we cannot afford to do, but would mean that we continue with the inherited, unfair legacy where some of our residents pay to park in their local town centre, and others do not."The proposals to approve the charges will be discussed by the council’s highways and transport committee on 25 January.
