The daughter of an 83-year-old woman who died after being attacked by an XL bully cross said she "didn’t have a clue" her mum’s inquest had taken place.Shirley Patrick, who had dementia, was repeatedly bitten at her Caerphilly home, leaving her with serious facial and head injuries. She died 17 days later in December 2022.Her daughter Gail Jones said the inquest happened "behind closed doors" and she only found out after contacting the coroner’s office to ask about the progress on her mother’s hearing.Gwent coroner’s office said "all notices required" to advise the family and the press of the intention to complete this inquest in writing were sent.
Warning: This story contains graphic images of dog attack injuriesMs Jones said her niece had been incorrectly listed as the next of kin as she had initially called the police and details of the inquest had been sent to her.When her niece logged into an old email account this week, she found an email from the coroner’s office."I wasn’t given any indication it was going to happen. I think it’s absolutely disgusting," Ms Jones said.She said she wanted the inquest to be held in public because she still had many unanswered questions."To be honest I was just gobsmacked. I never expected that to happen - I expected us to be able to be there as a family to be able to ask," she said.On 3 December 2022, Ms Patrick was being cared for by her son when she was repeatedly bitten by the now-banned dog.The inquest concluded Ms Patrick died as a result of an "unprovoked attack at her home address by an XL bully dog".Her cause of death was given as "sepsis, pneumonia and infected scalp wounds" and "traumatic lacerations secondary to a dog attack".
The coroner found no evidence that the dog had a history of aggressive behaviour.Ms Jones said she would have liked to have challenged that because the dog "had been passed between four owners" in a matter of months, she said.Gwent Police confirmed that four people arrested in connection with the case had been released without charge and there was no further action being taken.Since her mother’s death Gail has been campaigning against the breeding of dangerous dogs and wants to meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.She said getting a change in the law to stop the deliberate breeding of dangerous dogs would mean her mother "did not die in vain".The Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs said the Dangerous Dogs Act outlawed breeding XL bullies and those breaking the law could be jailed for up to 14 years and have their dogs put down.
Inquests are held to determine the cause and circumstances of deaths, including "violent or unnatural" ones such as those caused by crime, accidents or suicide.They are generally held in public but, since 2022, under a new section of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, coroners can hold an inquest in writing when a senior coroner "decides that a hearing is unnecessary".However, the law states that this cannot be decided unless "no public interest would be served by a hearing" and the death is non contentious.Coroners must also not decide to hold it in writing unless they have invited representations from each interested person known to them.The record of inquest signed by the Gwent Coroner Caroline Saunders stated she had "received no representations on reasonable grounds that a hearing should take place".
