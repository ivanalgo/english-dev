Controversial plans to turn a three-bedroom home into a house in multiple occupation (HMO) for nine people have been withdrawn after public disquiet and vandalism.The proposal for the house in Seaham, County Durham, led to dozens of objections from residents, who branded the bid “insane”.The applicant David Smith said the project aimed to help support local NHS students, but that his intentions had been “grossly misrepresented".Tensions came to a head last week when a window at the front of the property on Frederick Street was smashed.
The outcry over the plans started in February when the planning application was submitted to Durham County Council, after the house was sold for £61,000 at auction.Mr Smith planned to build an extension and convert the existing garage to house the nine occupants, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.But objections from residents, Seaham Town Council and the area’s MP Grahame Morris soon followed.
Zoe Swenson-Wright, who lives next door to the property, said she believed the damage caused to the property was likely to be a form of protest vandalism."We never have vandalism on this street," she said. "It’s the kind of neighbourhood where people knock on the door to tell you you left your keys in the lock."Ms Swenson-Wright added: "It was such an insane plan. They were trying to build a house where vulnerable people coming out of prison or refugees would not be able to cook for themselves. "The only plan seemed to be to make as much money as possible."But Mr Smith said those were incorrect rumours.In a statement to residents, he wrote: "Our plan was to create a safe, convenient living space for students to enhance their professional competence. "Regrettably, the backlash and outright hostility have forced me to reconsider my investment in this project."
