The M25 in Surrey has reopened ahead of schedule after being shut all weekend between junctions 10 and 11 for roadworks, National Highways says.The motorway had been closed between the Wisley and Chertsey junctions since 21:00 BST on Friday, but reopened at 23:00 on Sunday, seven hours earlier than planned.National Highways said on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday that the works had been completed early and the motorway was open in both directions.It was the third of five weekend closures on the M25 this year which have been rolled out to allow for the construction and installation of a bridge on the western gyratory of the roundabout at junction 10.
The £317m project, which is due to be completed in the summer of 2025, is expected to increase the number of lanes at junction 10, which is one of the UK’s busiest motorway junctions.Between 4,000 and 6,000 vehicles normally use the M25 between junctions nine, near Leatherhead, and 11, in each direction every hour between 10:00 and 21:00 at weekends.The final two weekend closures will take place later in 2024.
