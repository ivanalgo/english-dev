Jersey primary school students have been learning about bee conservation.Pupils have been visiting the Bee Field to hear from the Jersey Beekeepers' Association about why they should not fear the insects and why they are important for the ecosystem.It was part of the A Day With The Bees programme which has been rolled out to schools in the island.Youngsters put on beekeeping suits, were shown the inside of beehives and learnt about how honey is made as part of the lessons.
Adriana was one of the pupils from St Lawrence Primary School who visited the site on Tuesday.She said the experience "got rid of my fear of bees" and people should "just stay still and not panic" if they are scared of bees."If you wave your hands around then the bees will feel scared so they will risk their lives to try and sting you," Adriana added.She also found out bees have "baskets on the backs of their feet" to carry pollen and the insects are "super important" for the ecosystem.
Tony Kirk, president of the Jersey Beekeepers' Association, came up with the programme.He said the visits had been "really heart-warming" and it was important to show youngsters "without the bees and other pollinators - the human existence is in a very precarious state".Mr Kirk added: "We can teach pupils that there is not that much to fear and help them understand the bees so they go away with a big smile and a sticky face from the honey‚Äù.It was the first year the programme had been rolled out in the island and it is hoped more schools will visit the site in the future.
