Lifeboat crews took 13 hours to rescue a yacht that posed a risk to life after it lost its steering off the Cornish coast.The Lizard RNLI lifeboat was launched at 10:30 BST on Monday to the yacht which was 46m (74km) south west of the Lizard.On arrival, coxswain Andrew Putt decided the stricken yacht presented a risk to life and danger to navigation, the RNLI said.The crew began towing the vessel to Newlyn harbour but had to be assisted by Penlee lifeboat which launched at 15:00.
A spokesperson said: "With no steering the yacht veered left and right, towing was difficult, making only two knots at times."They said the Penlee lifeboat took over the tow from the Lizard lifeboat which then acted as a brake behind the yacht.At around 23:30 the lifeboats successfully brought the yacht in to Newlyn harbour.
