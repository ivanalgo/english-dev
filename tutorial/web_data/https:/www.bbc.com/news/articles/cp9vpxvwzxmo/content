Prospective tram users are invited to have their say on proposed routes for West Yorkshire's long-awaited mass transit system.Plans for the scheme were announced last week, with the first line running between Leeds and Bradford.A second would link the centre of Leeds with the White Rose Shopping Centre in the south of the city and St James' Hospital in the north.Twenty drop-in events are being held across the region until September, with the first taking place in Beeston later.
The 11-week consultation on phase one of the network will close on 30 September.Simon Warburton, West Yorkshire Combined Authority’s (WYCA) executive director of transport, said more than 1,000 people had already given feedback on the plans.Deliberations on the chosen routes will be held in 2025, with Mayor Tracy Brabin promising to have spades in the ground by 2028.
The WYCA is also seeking feedback on its sustainability strategy for the project.Mr Warburton said: “Mass transit will act as a catalyst for growth and help us to create a better-connected West Yorkshire.“This is a scheme that will change the way people get around the region for generations to come. For such an important decision, we need to hear as many people’s opinions as possible.“We now want people to pop in, ask our project team, and find out more about our plans.”
