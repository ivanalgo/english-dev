A headteacher fears parents could move their children to other schools if proposals for a mortuary next door are given the go-ahead.Hardy's Funeral Service has submitted a planning application for a new facility on High Grange Road close to King Street Primary School in Spennymoor, County Durham, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.In an objection letter, head Joanne Bromley said the plan would not be appropriate.Hardy's Funeral Service has been approached for comment, but in its application it said it would be "considerate" to the school.
Ms Bromley added: "We firmly believe that parents would not feel this is an appropriate proposal and any new parents would not choose our school in the future."Parent Deborah Collinson said parking in the area was already "difficult during peak times".She added: "I have two children attending this school and a business of this nature is likely to cause anxiety for them walking past it every day and subsequently cause anxiety about going to school."
Spennymoor Town Council and Durham county councillors have also publicly opposed the proposal for a change of use from a home to a funeral parlour.In documents submitted as part of the application, Hardy's Funeral Service said the property would be used as a place where bereaved families could "visit their deceased relatives discreetly away from the general public". The said: "We would be considerate towards school start and leaving times to avoid vehicle movements at these times."The application is due to be considered later this year.
