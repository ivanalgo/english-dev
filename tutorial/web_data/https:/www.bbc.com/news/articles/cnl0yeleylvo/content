The UK's first multiplex cinema has avoided demolition after developers' plans to replace it with flats were refused.Milton Keynes Council voted unanimously to reject a proposal from Galliard Holdings Ltd (GHL) to replace The Point, which showed its last film in 2015, with retail units and up to 487 flats.In a report, councillors said the plans did not deliver an acceptable level of affordable housing and there were no "convincing justification of public benefits to outweigh the harm to heritage assets".Chairman Stephen Brown described the application to the planning committee as "sub optimal".
He said: "It doesn't feel like this application has proceeded in the ideal way."We all feel this is a sub-optimal application that has came before us."The Point opened in 1985 and is recognised as a non-designated heritage asset.Kingsman: The Secret Service was the last film shown at the site before it was replaced by the Imax at Stadium MK.
While rejecting the plans councillors also raised concerns about the impact the new flats would have on the Milton Keynes skyline, the privacy between blocks and the design of the building.However they added in their report that "the proposal is generally considered acceptable in other aspects".
