A road in Coventry has been closed after a small sinkhole appeared, the city council says.The hole on Greens Road was discovered on Friday and has since been cordoned off.Repairs are due to start on Monday and the authority thanked residents for their patience and asked for cones and barriers near the affected area not to be moved.Weakening underground can cause sinkholes to appear, as well as heavy rain and human triggers like construction work or burst water mains, the British Geological Society said.
