Major work to upgrade traffic lights and improve a busy city roundabout is almost complete.The six-week project to upgrade Derby's Spider Island in Allenton began on 17 June, with lane closures and temporary lights leading to delays on approaches for drivers.Prior to the work starting, Derby City Council said the traffic lights at Spider Island had not been replaced for about 20 years. The new lights will be "more energy efficient" and "improve traffic flow" when they become operational on 2 August.
A city council spokesperson told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: "This new technology uses less cable and is more energy efficient, reducing our overall energy use and carbon footprint."The upgraded system will be better at detecting vehicles and pedestrians, with a focus on prioritising delayed buses."This will improve traffic flow at the junction for everyone who uses it, leading to better air quality in the area."The majority of work at Spider Island is now complete."Temporary traffic signals will remain in place until Friday, August 2 to allow the remaining minor works to be completed."Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
