The burnt remains of a harbour porpoise have been found on a beach.The creature's carcass was pictured on social media in the dunes of Redcar beach.Experts say it is common for porpoises to strand on UK shores, but nobody should be tempted to go near them.A spokesperson for British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) said people should contact it or their local council to arrange disposal.

Harbour porpoises are known to swim close to the shore, so they can get into difficulty in shallow waters and be washed up on beaches when the tide goes out.However, people should not try to dispose of porpoises by burning them, the BDMLR said.Not only did those responsible risk potentially catching disease from the animal, they could have caused damage to "lots of species" in the dunes.
"If you find a dead dolphin or a porpoise, ring us or the local council, and they will remove it safely," the BDMLR spokesperson said."If the animal is alive, ring us directly."It looks like what has happened here is a bit silly and totally pointless. You can't burn porpoises, that doesn't work."
