An exhibition of art documenting the journeys of refugees from countries like Honduras, Ukraine and Malaysia has gone on display.Volunteer-run charity Cheltenham Welcomes Refugees is behind the exhibition, which includes work by professional artists.The pieces are influenced by refugees' memories of home, their journeys to Cheltenham and their new lives in the UK.The exhibition opened at Sixteen Gallery on 26 July, and will finish on Wednesday 31 July.
Volunteers from Cheltenham Welcomes Refugees organise community welcome events for those arriving in the spa town, whether they are going through the asylum system or arriving as resettled refugees.Local volunteers support with English classes, children's activities, football clubs, fixing bikes, and providing lifts.Volunteer Anna Ost said: "This is a wonderful opportunity to creatively tell the stories of people who arrive in Cheltenham as refugees and asylum seekers, seeking sanctuary in our town."
"It’s brilliant to celebrate the hopefulness and determination which has led people here and that’s why the exhibition has the theme of New Chapters," Ms Ost added."Many of the artists have overcome extremely difficult circumstances to eventually find safety here and this exhibition is a testament to many spirits soaring, creating and thriving, despite adversity."The professional artists featured include Eduardo Guerra, Oksana Fursovich, Samy Osorio Mora, Sara Rahman, Samy Osorio Mora, Tetiana Frey and Zarik Rosita Hanif. Music and food and drink from many of the cultures represented in the exhibition will also be featured during the week.
