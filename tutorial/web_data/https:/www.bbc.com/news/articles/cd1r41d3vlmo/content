Thousands of people gathered in Nottingham for this year's Pride celebrations.Notts Pride, which celebrates the LGBTQ+ community, began in the Hockley area of the city in 1997 and has taken place there every year since 2014.This year's celebrations involved a new route as the march travelled through the city centre, starting at Lister Gate and ending at Sneinton Market on Saturday.Organisers said this was to allow more people to attend after more than 10,000 people gathered last year, an increase on the 8,000 who took part in 2022.
This year's theme was the power of love.The march began at 11:00 BST and travelled through several streets including Victoria Street, High Cross Street and Goose Gate.A series of rainbow crossings, first created in 2019 in Carlton Street and Broad Street, Hockley, were repainted ahead of the event.
Volunteers at the event said they felt society had become more inclusive of people's differences.Helen Torr, who volunteered for the first time last year, said: "It was nice to see people come along, celebrate their differences and feel included. "People can come to Pride and be themselves and that's important for me."
Venue owners also said the LGBTQ+ community has changed over the years, with people now feeling "more comfortable" in public.Craig Pennington Hayes, owner of the Lord Roberts Pub, said: "Guys sit there with their arms around each other and nobody bats an eyelid."Things have changed massively. It's a place where you can be whoever you want to be."
Notts Pride chair Leigh Ellis said: "Notts Pride brings visibility to the streets of Nottingham to be heard, to enjoy a vibrancy of colour."There are people celebrating, there are people who want to be heard."This is a time for us all to come together, and what it shows is that Nottingham celebrates diversity."
