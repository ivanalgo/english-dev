A woman who reported being drugged while on a night out believes making spiking a specific criminal offence will “help bring closure” to victims.A new law is expected to be included in more than 35 bills announced in the King’s Speech later.Putting a drug into someone’s drink or body without their consent is already a crime but Number 10 believes a new offence will help police solve more cases of spiking.Nina Galley, from Debenham, Suffolk, said she was spiked in October 2021 and believes the move could have a “big impact”.
“Not just me, but a couple of my other friends got spiked and nothing got solved because there just wasn’t enough evidence," she said.“I don’t think it was seen as a serious thing and most people just thought, ‘You’ve got too drunk’, or that you’re attention seeking - but it’s not like that at all.“So, I think a new law would help so many people get closure, 100%.”
News of the potential new law comes after BBC Suffolk obtained data revealing how many spiking offences have been recorded in the county.A Freedom of Information response shows 83 reports of spiking were made between 1 June 2023 and 31 May 2024, 33 of which were in Ipswich.In that period three people were charged and 45 investigations were launched but subsequently closed after no suspect was identified.The figures show a reduction in reports when compared to the previous 12 months.
During that time the police launched 120 spiking investigations, before 79 of them were shut down after no suspects were identified.Only one person was charged.Ms Galley said although it was more than two years ago that she was spiked, she was still haunted by the experience.“I tried going out with my friends but when I got to their house I had a panic attack and had to go home, and I am always more cautious and scared now,” she said.“It does have a really long lasting effect on people but having a law is really going to help tackle that and bring the seriousness of the situation to light.”Suffolk Police has been contacted for comment.
