Firefighters from the Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service have been given new uniforms.The fire service said the new uniforms have been introduced for a number of reasons, such as improving quality, wearability, identity and cost savings.From Monday 29 July, staff will return their old black uniforms in exchange for navy blue kit with a full colour GFRS logo.Some of the new kit includes elasticated waistbands, breathable fabrics to provide additional comfort, maternity wear, vegan items and religious head coverings.
GFRS said having garments that will last, are comfortable and withstand the vigorous role of firefighters will result in a lower turnover for uniform and reduce overall costs.The service added that old uniforms will be returned and disposed of in a "secure and environmental way" with any suitable surplus stock items being repurposed or donated wherever possible.Councillor Dave Norman, cabinet member with responsibility for the Fire and Rescue Service said he is delighted with the new uniform.â€œIt benefits both the community and our staff who will enjoy increased garment quality and comfort, all while delivering cost savings," he said.Mark Preece, chief fire officer for GFRS said the new uniform will provide many benefits to staff and communities and help create a "positive workplace culture".
