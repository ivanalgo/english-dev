A man who contracted hepatitis through an infected blood transfusion has said Northern Ireland's compensation scheme is "nowhere near ready" to help victims.Nigel Hamilton was among 30,000 people across the UK who were infected with deadly viruses as a result of the contaminated blood scandal.The victims could each receive payments of about £2m under a compensation scheme announced by the government in Westminster.But speaking to Stormont's Health Committee, Mr Hamilton said there were too many barriers in a compensation system that is "complex enough".He also said that while the public inquiry is over, when it comes to compensation and psychological support, things have only just begun. Now 63 years old, he was just 16 when he received a blood transfusion for an eye operation in 1976.His twin brother Simon, who died on Christmas Day last year, had also contracted the disease through blood transfusions.The UK infected blood inquiry began in 2017 and published its final report in London last week.It found that the infection of 30,000 people with HIV and hepatitis between 1970 and 1991 could have been largely avoided.Mr Hamilton said the public inquiry was a "powerful and traumatic" experience for everyone involved.He added that it is critical that the inquiry's recommendations are not only implemented but also scrutinised by a local oversight group.
The government has said the first payments to victims will be made by the end of the year.It also said compensation will be eventually extended to family and loved ones of those who are affected.In the meantime, extra interim payments of £210,000 will be paid to victims by the end of the summer.Mr Hamilton told the health committee that the infected blood community rely on local representation as they are detached from everyone else in the UK.He told the committee they do not want "hollow words, they want action".On compensation, Mr Hamilton said the group is concerned that the statutory payment scheme is to be rolled into the overall compensation package.He said some victims will be receiving a one-off payment of up to £1.5m instead of payments being spread out over their lifetime."At my age, a compensation package that will be worth £1.5m will be no good to me at 64," Mr Hamilton said."A lot of people can't handle a lot of money at one time when they have never had it, so those people need to be supported."
The committee also heard that a dedicated psychologist for those both infected and affected had their contract "terminated" with the role moved to the general haemophilia unit within the Belfast Health Trust.Mr Hamilton said this was not appropriate especially for those whose loved ones are affected.The committee was told that while a stakeholder's group for those affected exists within the Department of Health it now needs to "kick off with some more zest".Mr Hamilton said victims and their families, many of whom have lost loved ones, need to see "justice and not hollow words".Among the inquiry's recommendations is the introduction of a statutory duty of candour which would include public authorities and civil servants.Mr Hamilton said "candour is very important as is openness and the willingness to listen".He said being open between authorities and patients and families instils confidence and should include political institutions and the civil service.
