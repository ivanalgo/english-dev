Seven people have been arrested after two Leeds city centre buildings were splattered with red paint.Barclays Bank on Albion Street and The Pinnacle building, which neighbours the branch, were coated in red spray paint overnight.Some glass fronts, windows and doors were shattered in the incident, which has been claimed by pro-Palestinian activists citing the bank's "investment in Israel's biggest weapons firm".A spokesperson for Barclays said although they provided financial services to companies supplying "defence products to NATO and its allies" they did not "directly invest" in them.
West Yorkshire Police said they received reports of criminal damage on Albion Street at around 02:28 BST.They said those involved had left the scene but a vehicle matching the description in reports was stopped nearby and the occupants inside arrested.They remain in custody, the force said.Earlier this month, the Barclays in Bradford was also covered in red paint.
A spokesperson for Barclays added: “While we support the right to protest, we ask that campaigners do so in a way which respects our customers, colleagues and property.”
