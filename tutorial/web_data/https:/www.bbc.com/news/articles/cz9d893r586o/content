Concerts and festivals such as Glastonbury are worth up to £900 million to the wider West economy, creating two million visits to the area.Umbrella arts organisation UK Music said the industry employed almost nine thousand people to work at shows in the West in 2023.The total number of music tourists attending live music events across the UK in 2023 was 19.2 million - an increase of 33% on 2022 when the figure was 14.4 million.But despite the growth in music tourism, independent events and grassroots music venues say they are still struggling.
Glastonbury is one of the biggest, most famous music festivals in the world.Around 200,000 people attended in 2023 and broadcast regulator Ofcom reports that approximately 210,000 people attended in 2024.UK Music, a British umbrella organisation which represents the UK music industry, said music tourism is a growing part of the music industry.It added that the South West has seen an an 86% increase in music tourism, rising from one million in 2022 to two million in 2023.
However, the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) said 50 UK festivals had completely closed or been postponed or cancelled for 2024.Among the festival cancellations in the West of England are NASS in Somerset, Nibley Festival and Barn on the Farm in Gloucestershire and Inglefest, near Bristol.Earlier this year, Shindig held its last-ever festival near in Ilminster, Somerset.The Music Venue Trust (MVT) reports that 125 venues in 2023 either shut or stopped live music.In December 2023, the iconic grassroots venue Moles in Bath closed after 45 years due to rising costs.Artists are also facing a cost-of-touring crisis, which UK Music say is concerning, as the artist-fan relationship is the base of the whole live music industry.
UK Music chief executive Tom Kiehl said: “Grassroots music venues and festivals, studios and rehearsal spaces are facing tough economic pressures and it’s vital that the music ecosystem that enables musicians and artists to perform is supported to ensure that everyone – no matter where they live - can have access to music.“We’re looking forward to working with the new government to ensure that all our towns and cities have thriving music ecosystems that support the growth of the industry - generating thousands more jobs, boosting economic growth and making their areas even more attractive to visitors.”
