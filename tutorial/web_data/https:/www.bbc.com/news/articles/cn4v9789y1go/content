London Mayor Sadiq Khan has further committed to his pledge to try to bring WrestleMania to the capital, after holding talks with World Wrestling Entertainment  (WWE) chief content officer Paul "Triple H" Levesque.Before his re-election in May, Mr Khan posted on social media that he wanted to go "even further" in making London the "sporting capital of the world".That included suggestions he would deliver the Super Bowl, the 2040 Olympics and WWE's showpiece premium live event, WrestleMania.After Mr Khan's initial message on X, Mr Levesque replied simply: "Let's talk."
Those talks began at City Hall on Thursday afternoon when Mr Levesque, a former WWE wrestler who was world champion on 14 occasions, sat down with the mayor."I'm really excited to have begun conversations about bringing international WrestleMania to London," Mr Khan told the PA news agency."I know there are many fans in London and across the UK and Europe who are desperate to see WrestleMania live."The previous 40 incarnations of WrestleMania have all taken place in North America, with 38 in the United States and two in Canada.
WWE has branched out in recent years and taken premium live events - the name of its larger, monthly shows - across the world.Cardiff and Glasgow have hosted "Clash at the Castle" events while the "Money in the Bank" show took place at the O2 last year.Saudi Arabia, Costa Rica and France have also staged shows, while Germany will host the "Bash in Berlin" in August.WWE's main competition, All Elite Wrestling, sold out Wembley Stadium last year and returns next month, with Mr Levesque keen to bring WrestleMania over the Atlantic, too.
"Why London? Some of our greatest and best fans are here in London. I've been coming here for 30 years. They're always incredible," he told PA.He said WWE had a "great history" in the UK.WWE boasts a number of British and Irish stars on its current roster, including the likes of Becky Lynch, Drew McIntyre, Sheamus and Finn Balor.Mr Levesque said: "This is just an opportunity for being in a different location, amazing fans... WWE is one of the true global brands and I think you should look forward to seeing us all over the world."Next year's WrestleMania will take place in Las Vegas, meaning the earliest the self-styled "showcase of the immortals" could be held in London is 2026.
