Community groups which help people through the cost-of-living crisis have been invited to apply for money from a new scheme.Warwick District Council said charities and not-for-profit groups can make applications for up to £3,000 from its Cost-of-Living Fund. It is targeted at those setting up or expanding schemes "that could benefit individuals and families who may be struggling", it said. Projects which would be considered include those providing meals and activities for children in the school holidays and schemes supporting people's mental health and wellbeing. Applications can be made until 10 February, said the council, adding that its team  could discuss projects or provide more information. 
"We are very aware of the impact that the cost-of-living crisis is having on the most vulnerable groups in our community," said Jim Sinnott, the council's portfolio holder for communities and leisure. "These grants will be allocated to allow small, grass roots organisations to boost their current offering or kick start a new project that could make a real difference to people’s lives.”
