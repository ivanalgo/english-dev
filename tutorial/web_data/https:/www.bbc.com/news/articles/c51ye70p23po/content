An "aggressive" nurse has been struck off after threatening to hit an elderly resident and "potentially putting other patients at risk".Abdikadir Hassan Mohamed was initially suspended after the incident at Bath's Culverhayes Nursing Home, a report by Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) stated.However, he refused to engage with proceedings, and has since been sacked.The NMC ruled because of Mr Mohamedâ€™s "failure to demonstrate safe practice and insight into his serious misconduct" he could not remain on the NMC Register. 
The report explained that on 12 April 2021, Mr Mohamed shouted at a resident, named Resident B, repeatedly telling him to go to his room.The nurse also "got very close" to him, said that he would hit him and shouted "if you are a resident then behave as a resident".He then invited Resident B to hit him.Staff witnessed him acting in an "aggressive, threatening and demeaning manner", and this caused distress to the nearby residents, the report stated. His actions were "unprofessional and caused escalation of an incident which had the potential to put others at risk", the report added.Mr Mohamed was suspended from practising as a nurse and has since not engaged with the proceedings into his actions.
The report stated: "The panel was of the view that if Mr Mohamed were to demonstrate full insight, genuine remorse and take steps to strengthen his practice then his misconduct would potentially be remediable."But the committee said the "absence of any insight, remorse, lack of awareness" has resulted in a striking-off order to "adequately protect the public and serve the public interest".The care home's owner Minal Desai told BBC News: "Staff at the home reported the incident to the NMC promptly in 2021."The nurse was suspended with immediate effect and subsequently sacked. He did not work in the home after the incident was reported."
