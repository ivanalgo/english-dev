A computer-generated image shows what the planned development on the site of a leisure centre in a Berkshire village could look like.Bracknell Forest Council approved plans for the replacement of John Nike Leisure Centre in Binfield last month.The ice rink and ski slope on the site closed in March 2020 at the start of the first coronavirus lockdown.Developers said it was no longer viable to operate a leisure facility at the site, so it will be replaced with an industrial unit
The green space at the bottom left corner of the image shows where the ski slope currently stands. Developer Barwood confirmed that the disused ski slope is owned by John Nike Leisuresport.The planning permission requires that the developer keep some parking spaces reserved in case the ski slope is brought back.Construction on the industrial unit can begin once a legal agreement is signed between the developer and Bracknell Forest Council.That includes a £324,000 contribution from Barwood towards renovating Bracknell Leisure Centre, to make up for the loss of the leisure facilities on John Nike Way.The BBC has contacted John Nike Leisuresport for a comment.Update: This story was updated on 15 February 2024 after an earlier version incorrectly said the new development was a leisure centre rather than an industrial building.
