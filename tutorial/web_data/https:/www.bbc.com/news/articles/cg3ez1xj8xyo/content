A mural for a market has been commissioned after its design came out on top in a public vote. The winning option for Powis Indoor Market, in Oswestry, Shropshire, includes illustrations of goods on sale and an interactive feature where people can take selfies holding balloons. It beat five other entries and then secured the backing of the town council at its July meeting.The authority anticipates the mural will be completed by the end of the summer, weather permitting.
During the public vote in June, displays and voting booths were put at the indoor market and The Guildhall.The winning entry, from artists Sarah Parkinson and Debbie Carr and featuring the words Welcome to Oswestry Market, attracted 132 out of more than 300 valid votes.Two of the other options had about 70 each, Oswestry Town Council said.The top three designs voted for by the public went to full council, with a recommendation from the working group overseeing the project to back the public's favourite. Full council agreed unanimously and the winning design has been commissioned with funding from the UK government.The artists said they would be "using many local businesses to support the mural from start to finish".They stated it was a "lovely surprise to hear that our design even captured votes from visitors to Oswestry from across the globe".
