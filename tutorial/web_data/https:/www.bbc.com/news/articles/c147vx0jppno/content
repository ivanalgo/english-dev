A care home is to shut due to a dwindling numbers of residents, a council has confirmed.Cumberland Council also said its decision to close Moot Lodge in Brampton, Cumbria, was because the building had "limited facilities."Hundreds of opponents to the closure had signed a petition calling for the home to be kept open, claiming closure would have a negative impact on residents.The council said the decision had been "difficult", but that two other care homes in Brampton had vacancies for residents.
The authority also blamed the closure on a lack of access to safe outdoor spaces.Moot Lodge has 18 registered beds and is currently home to seven people.
Almost 300 people took part in a public consultation about its future, with 86% being against the closure.In addition, 673 people signed an online petition saying the home was "an important part of the town".Councillor Lisa Brown, the executive member for adults and community health, said it had been a "difficult decision" made with the "best interests of residents at heart"."We are committed to ensuring that every resident affected by the closure will receive the support and care they need during this transition."Our priority is to provide environments that enhance the quality of life, dignity, and independence of our residents."
