A group of councillors has written to the defence secretary after bird nests were allegedly destroyed."Vast areas" of Middlewick Ranges, in Colchester, where it is "believed skylarks are nesting", were allegedly mown earlier in July.Six members of Colchester City Council's Labour group wrote to John Healey on Monday to ask if the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO), which manages the former Army training site, was aware of the nesting sites before the grass was cut.The DIO said mowing the grass was necessary to reduce the risk of wildfires, and that it followed advice from the RSPB.
"I'm angry and really disappointed, which is why we're asking for clarity," said Lee Scordis, one of the signatories of the letter.Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative MP for Harwich and North Essex, told the BBC he also planned to write to the defence secretary to raise concerns about the allegation.
The land was allocated for the development of 1,000 new homes by the council in its Local Plan in 2022.The reported incident has sparked calls for the site to be removed from the Local Plan."There will be no skylarks at all if the open space is replaced with housing," Sir Bernard said.Mike Lilley, a Labour councillor, added: "We cannot ignore anymore that the area has a lot of wildlife."The DIO said the grass was cut in July "to mitigate the impact upon ground-nesting birds".
