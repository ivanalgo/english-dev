New measures have been put in place to prevent homes flooding near a nature reserve.The natural flood management scheme at the Littleworth Nature Reserve in Oxfordshire aims to reduce the risk for those living in the downstream hamlet of  Littleworth and in Wheatley village.In the past, the areas have been affected during periods of prolonged heavy rain, according to South Oxfordshire District Council.The project has cost about £21,000.
Designed by the Freshwater Habitat Trust, the scheme involves slowing the flow of water through the railway cutting at the site.Funded by the Environment Agency, the project will also provide temporary water storage on the land.A culvert entrance within the nature reserve was cleared and an extra grate added upstream to trap leaves and silt to reduce the risk of it becoming blocked, according to the council.Natural dams were also created using eight willow trees from the site.In addition, contractors installed willow spiling – weaving branches between wooden stakes – to act as a natural flood barrier.Both the trees and willow spiling are expected to resprout and take root, strengthening the structures over time, the authority added.Pete Sudbury, Oxfordshire County Council's deputy leader in charge of environment, said flooding could be devastating for people.“That’s why we need as much land as possible to be managed in ways that help hold back or absorb excess rain," he added.
