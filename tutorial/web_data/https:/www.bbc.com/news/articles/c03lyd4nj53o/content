A West Midlands Police officer and his canine partner have been deployed to Paris to assist in the security arrangements for the Olympic Games.Police Dog Minnie and handler Sgt Chris Roberts made checks in the athletes’ village and sports venues ahead of Friday's opening ceremony.The force said Sgt Roberts and the seven-year-old Springer Spaniel had a great bond and had been working together since Minnie qualified in 2018."Minnie is a superstar," Sgt Roberts said. "She is our smallest operational police dog, but don’t let that fool you."
He added: "She is a fantastic search dog and has had some great successes over the years.“It’s an honour to be working with her at the Paris Olympics."Since Minnie qualified, she has worked with Sgt Roberts on high-profile events such as the NATO summit in 2019 and the Commonwealth Games."It’s truly an honour to represent the force and the country in supporting the security operation," Sgt Roberts said.At the end of Friday's search deployments, all the dogs involved were invited to the British Embassy to visit the staff and the ambassador, who extended their thanks to all handlers and the dogs for their efforts and commitments in representing British policing.
