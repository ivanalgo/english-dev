A new book has delved into the history behind the "breath-taking" discovery of an ancient burial ground at an RAF base.The initial finds at RAF Lakenheath were made during the 1950s while work was being carried out on Lakenheath Hospital, before a professional dig was established between 1997 and 2008.The Anglo-Saxon Cemeteries at RAF Lakenheath, Eriswell, Suffolk volume explores the excavations of human remains, which resulted in the discovery of four separate, but linked, burial grounds dating from the 5th to the 8th Century.One of the skeletons belonged to the so-called Lakenheath Warrior, who was found fully armed alongside a horse adorned with a highly ornate bridle.
Archaeologists uncovered 427 graves, including six men buried with swords and horses, three minstrels, and one man with a quiver of arrows.Experts also found eight cremation burials, which included horse remains, 96 female or juvenile graves with brooches, and 2,500 glass beads.
The extent of the discovery is explored in the new book, part of the East Anglian Archaeology series, designed to give a detailed picture of life on the Suffolk Fen-edge in the Early Saxon period.Authors Jo Caruth and John Hines said: "The excavations at RAF Lakenheath have delivered a wealth of archaeological data."In compiling this book, we were able to build upon highly professional recording and recovery in the process of excavation with a range of cutting-edge post-excavation studies, reflecting complementary expertise in the study of human remains, artefacts and features."
Funded by the Ministry of Defence, it has been produced across two volumes and published by Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service (SCCAS) and Cotswold Archaeology.Philip Faircloth-Mutton, Suffolk County Council’s cabinet member for environment, communities and equality, added: "Suffolk is home to an incredibly influential past."The volume of history that has been uncovered, and now expertly documented from RAF Lakenheath, is quite breath-taking."I’ve no doubt this book will be a fundamental reference point for serious and informed study."The Lakenheath Warrior, his horse and some of the objects from the cemeteries are on loan to Mildenhall Museum where they can be viewed by the public.The excavation finds archive will be held by Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service to allow it to be made freely available to future researchers.
