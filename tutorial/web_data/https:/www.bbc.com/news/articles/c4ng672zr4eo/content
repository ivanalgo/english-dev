Ten groups which help people cope with mental health issues, including feelings of suicide, have been awarded money to help with their work.The grants, which range from £500 to £15,000, have been awarded by the Kent and Medway Suicide Prevention Programme.Recipients include Route 23, a pop up coffee shop in Canterbury which runs sessions for vulnerable new parents, and the Luna Foundation, which supports children after a suicide in their family.The grants are administered jointly by Kent County Council and Medway Council.
Other recipients are the Autism Apprentice, in Queensborough on the Isle of Sheppey, which supports autistic children and their families, Emerge Medway, which puts volunteers in A&E and children's wards to identify and help young people who self-harm, and SATEDA, a domestic abuse charity in Swale which helps women and children.Carey Philpott, SATEDA's chief executive, said: "We will help young women to understand their relationships and the choices they have."By promoting inner strength and sharing techniques to help increase mental wellness and resilience, we can reduce the risk of harm from domestic abuse."
Dr Kate Langford, NHS Kent and Medway's chief medical officer, said: “It’s these smaller organisations, often run by volunteers, that can help build an effective network of mental health support in our communities."People can learn from others who have been through similar experiences, understand how to help themselves and know where to go for support when they need it.”If you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help is available from BBC Action Line.
