An ambulance service is urging the public to download and use a potentially life-saving locator app over the school holidays. What3Words is a free mobile phone application that gives every three square metres of the world a unique three-word phrase.South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb) said rescuers were able to use the words to quickly and precisely locate those in need.““The what3words app is just one method we have at our disposal for locating a patient. We’d encourage people to download the app as it can prove extremely useful, especially in more remote locations,” a Secamb spokesperson said.
“As we move into school summer holidays, when more people will be outside hopefully enjoying some sun, we urge people to plan and prepare for their journeys and days out, especially when they may be in unfamiliar locations," the spokesperson added.Secamb said the app was useful when people were not sure of their exact whereabouts.
John Powell, from Tarring Neville, East Sussex, said the app helped save his life after he was “catapulted into the trees” during a bike ride in 2020.He said What3Words was invaluable after the accident on Firle Beacon left him with a punctured lung and several other injures.His friend Nick used the app to help the air ambulance locate the pair and rush Mr Powell to hospital.“If I'd been on my own that day, it would have been quite a bit more serious,” the 46-year-old told BBC Sussex.
