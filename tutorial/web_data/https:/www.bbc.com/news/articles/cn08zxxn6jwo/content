A "predator" who raped and sexually assaulted a girl on multiple occasions "for his own gratification" has been jailed.Cheshire Police said Andrew Bate's crimes began when he forced the then-eight-year-old to watch pornographic videos and progressed to multiple attacks across a six-year period.The force said the girl had pretended to be asleep to try and stop the abuse but Bate had continued to attack her.The 41-year-old, of Warrington, was found guilty of 16 sexual offences at Liverpool Crown Court and sentenced to 21 years in prison.
The force said the girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, told the court how the offences developed over a number of years before she "sought the courage" to report what had happened.Bate was subsequently charged with rape, sexual assault, engaging in sexual activity with a child and sexual touching.
Speaking after sentencing, Det Con Maurizio Lucchesi said Bate had shown "no regard" for the girl.He said Bate had denied what happened "even when faced with all the evidence against him, which forced her to relive her experiences in court, "which could not have been easy".He said the girl deserved praise for the "courage" she showed throughout the trial and the investigation and he hoped the sentence would provide "some closure" and allow her to "move forward... knowing that he will never be able do the same to any other children"."Bate is clearly a sexual predator, whose only interest is to fulfil his own sexual gratification," he added."The jury have seen through his lies and he is now being held accountable for his actions."Bate was ordered to sign the sex offendersâ€™ register for life and comply with a sexual harm prevention order.
