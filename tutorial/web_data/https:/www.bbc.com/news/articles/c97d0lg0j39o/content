Bridlington RNLI has a female helm for the first time in the station’s 219-year history.Sarah Berrey qualified in July and immediately took up the landmark position on the town’s D-Class inshore lifeboat Ernie Wellings.Ms Berrey has been a RNLI volunteer for more than six years and has been described as an “inspiration” by her colleagues.“I believe that anyone can achieve whatever they want to be with the RNLI,” she said.
“I have had the privilege of working alongside some fantastic people with a wealth of knowledge to pass onto the next generation of lifeboat volunteers.“The RNLI, and especially the volunteer crew here at Bridlington RNLI, encourages everyone to learn and develop the skills required, it is this support that has helped me become a qualified helm.”A helm is responsible for the inshore lifeboat during launching, at sea and through recovery, as well as the safety of the crew onboard.During her time with Bridlington RNLI, Ms Berrey served as a crew member on both the D class and Shannon class lifeboats. She is also the station lifeboat training co-ordinator.Bridlington lifeboat operations manager Steve Clarke added: “All this has been achieved in finding the balance between being a parent, being in full-time employment as well as volunteering for the RNLI.“I have no doubt that Sarah will be a huge asset in the role as helm. She is an inspiration to all.”Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram. Send your story ideas to eastyorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk
