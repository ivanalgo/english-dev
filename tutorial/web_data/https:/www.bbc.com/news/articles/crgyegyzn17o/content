More than 1,720 North Surrey residents have lodged objections to plans to turn part of a shopping centre into 200 homes, claiming the development will “ruin” the village.Hersham Green Shopping Centre would lose five independent stores to make way for two six-storey residential blocks for late living flats if the plan goes ahead.James Woodburn, Save Hersham Centre campaigner and resident, said the strength of feeling in Hersham was "unprecedented".A spokesperson from developers Quadrant said the £6m development would "preserve the centre for the community".
Mr Woodburn told the Local Democracy Reporting Service the development would “rip the heart out of Hersham forever and it would be irreversible”.A total of 1,721 objectsions were received by Elmbridge Borough Council by 26 April, the final day people could comment on the application.Citing the Save Hersham Centre cause as the "driving force" of the objections, Mr Woodburn said its success was due to "honest, straightforward and non-political" campaigning.He said the amount of support was "humbling" and "proved" the campaign was was "on the moral high ground".A spokesperson for developers Quadrant said: "We want to preserve the centre for the community by investing £6m to modernise the retail space in compliance with new energy efficiency standards that come into force in 2027.“The future success of the centre depends on having sufficient car parking and we are proposing enough spaces to meet retailer requirements and planning policy guidelines.”
