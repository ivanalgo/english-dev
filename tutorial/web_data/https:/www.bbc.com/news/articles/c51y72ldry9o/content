A prolific people smuggler has been jailed after arranging small boat crossings to the UK.National Crime Agency (NCA) investigators believe Albanian national Eglantin Doksani, 24, may have been responsible for transporting hundreds of people across the English Channel in 2022.They identified him as an associate of Hewa Rahimpur, a leader of a human trafficking gang.Doksani pleaded guilty to seven offences, including facilitating illegal immigration, and was sentenced to nine years and nine months imprisonment at St Albans Crown Court on Wednesday.
Iranian national Rahimpur, who police believe was behind a ring that brought 10,000 people to the UK in small boats, was jailed for 11 years in Belgium last year.The NCA said Doksani acted as an agent for migrants, brokering spaces on boats operated by Rahimpur's network and others.WhatsApp conversations found on Rahimpur's phone showed discussions about people Doksani wanted moving to the UK.In one message, Doksani told Rahimpur: "Pls try to do something tomorrow to send the guys because I have 10 more people waiting for me. Cash in hand."In another, they discussed payment, with Doksani saying: "Next time bro I'm gonna bring better all together for 10 people 30K Â£".
NCA officers arrested Doksani at his flat in the Isle of Dogs, east London, in July 2022.As they arrived, a bag was seen to be thrown from a window which later found to contain cocaine.He was bailed pending further enquiries but arrested again in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, after further evidence of his people smuggling activities was uncovered.The NCA found he had been using a fraudulent passport to open bank accounts, which were later used to deposit his criminal profits.
Doksani was also sentenced for fraud, money laundering and drug supply offences and faces deportation after he is released from prison.NCA branch commander Mark Howes said: "We will never know for sure how many people he was involved in moving, but it is likely to have been hundreds."
