A Jersey employment rights group said it "can't understand" why employers on the island are not giving their workers the right paperwork.The Jersey Advisory and Conciliation Service (JACS) said it has seen a rise in the number of people approaching it because they had not been given a contract or payslips.Patricia Rowan, director of JACS, said there was often "no malice", but that was no excuse.Its annual report highlighted the need to provide statutory paperwork and pointed out that not doing so was a breach of the law.
JACS describes itself as an "employment relations service", saying it helps people involved in business to reach agreements which are suitable to all the parties involved.
That can involve dealing with employers, employees, and trade unions.JACS' annual report said it dealt with 9,446 enquires in 2023, a 10% increase on 2022.Patricia Rowan said employees were "more aware of their rights".She said: "I think it's just increased awareness of legislation."More people are aware of their rights, so therefore it isn't about whether Jersey is a good or bad place to work, it's about the protections and people being aware of those."
The data also showed the service was contacted by 572 people who had not been given a contract within four weeks of starting in a new job, and almost 79 people who were not being given payslips."The rule on payslips hasn't changed, but we've seen an increase in the number of people who don't have the statutory paperwork in place."It's unfathomable, and we can't understand why it's changed, and why now."But it is a statutory right and so those employers which don't produce the correct paperwork are at risk of claims from employees," she said.
