A region's transport network is to change its name for the first time in almost 40 years as part of a new "whole system approach", it has been announced.Merseytravel, which has been used for public transport on Merseyside since the mid-1980s, will be replaced by Transport for Liverpool City Region (TfLCR), the area's combined authority said.The change was promised by mayor Steve Rotheram in his election manifesto earlier in the year.A TfLCR representative said the rebranded network would "promote mobility across the region for our communities and businesses by creating increased linkage between rail, bus, ferry, tunnels, and active travel".
The Local Democracy Reporting Service said the change would bring the region in line with areas such as Manchester and London with their own distinct regional transport branding and would be rolled out with the Metro system across the area.
A new crest and flag is being designed for the city region to be introduced by the end of this year, but it is not yet known when the name change could come into effect.The move to be known as TfLCR would not be the first name change, as the transport authority was previously known as Merseyside Passenger Transport Authority and Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive.The rebrand is part of wide-ranging plans to connect rail, bus, ferry, tunnels and active travel options across the six local authority areas and is the latest in a series of moves to change public transport in the region.In October 2023, the decision to bring buses back into public control was formally ratified and in the last 18 months, a £500m fleet of new trains have taken to the Merseyrail network.A new £80m Headbolt Lane station was also opened in Kirkby, while a £100m station is due to to open at Liverpool Baltic in 2027. A Bus Rapid Transport connection linking the city centre with Liverpool John Lennon Airport, Anfield and Bramley-Moore Dock could also be in place by 2028.The next phase of smart ticketing is also expected to roll out by March 2025, including changes to fare and concession options.
