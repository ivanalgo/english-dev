A time-line for the completion of a £33million project to improve Bury’s outdoor market has been published. Following a successful bid from Bury Council, the market received £20million from the former Conservative government’s levelling up fund.That money, along with a further £13million of funds for the project from Bury Council, will also be used for a "multifunctional flexi-hall". The hall will be an events building able to host events, food and drink outlets and have space for business and community use.
The outdoor market will have new roof canopies above the stalls and pedestrian walkways, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reports. The council said access improvements would create a more visible, high-profile entrance to the market. There will also be better links from the market to the interchange, Bury College, the Mill Gate shopping centre and Kay Gardens and improvements to seating and landscaping. Service diversions will start in Murray Road in the coming weeks and the scheme is expected to be complete by July 2026. The authority said the plans had been heavily influenced by feedback from a public consultation last year.There will be a public drop-in session to find out more about the plans at The Golden Mile, Bury Outdoor Market, from 10:00 to 15:00 BST on 24 July. Councillor Charlotte Morris, cabinet member for culture, economy and skills, said: "Bury Market plays a vital role in bolstering Bury’s economy, providing hundreds of jobs, bringing in large amounts of money to the town and supporting a loyal customer base.“Our regeneration plans aim to build upon these strengths and future-proof not only the market but our historic town centre as well."
