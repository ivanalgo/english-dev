A new rail link connecting communities such as Fraserburgh and Peterhead with Aberdeen could bring major economic and safety benefits, a study has found.The Buchan area of Aberdeenshire has not had a train service for more than 50 years.But new research concluded a rail connection could boost job opportunities in the area, assist access to healthcare and reduce serious road accidents.It was commissioned by the Campaign for North East Rail (CNER) and Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce (AGCC).
The Buchan Sustainable Transport Study, which was commissioned last year, used data analysis and surveys with hundreds of residents.It was funded through the Scottish government's Just Transition Fund.The option of a passenger and freight rail line between Aberdeen city centre and Fraserburgh via Peterhead could also stop at Dyce, Newmachar, Ellon, Cruden Bay and St Fergus.The cost of such a project has still to be fully determined.
The report found that opening the new link could reduce 75% of fatal or serious accidents on the A90/A952 by 75% by 2037-2041, compared to during the period 2014-2019.It said rail could connect workers to renewable energy opportunities centred around ports and harbours across the region.And Buchan’s existing long-term industries such as food, drink and tourism could also benefit.Fishing and seafood processing are key sectors in Fraserburgh and Peterhead.
Jordan Jack, general secretary of CNER, said extending the East Coast Line northwards would be "transformative" for the north east of Scotland."Fraserburgh and Peterhead are among the most deprived settlements in Aberdeenshire, and reconnection to the rail network will drastically improve people's economic fortunes, health outcomes, education and social inclusion," he said."Poor transport links are stifling our potential, damaging access to healthcare, and limiting job opportunities in the region."Russell Borthwick, the AGCC chief executive of the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said the "scale of what’s possible" was shown by the study."This link could reverse economic inequality and deliver a boost to Buchan, turbocharging its net zero, food and drink and tourism offerings," he added."In addition, it could drastically reduce emissions from passenger and freight transport."The Scottish government said: "We look forward to hearing how businesses and the local community engage with the findings of the report and any further research the Campaign for North East Rail may produce with the support of local stakeholders."
