Two women have been arrested for trespassing on a US airbase during a peace protest. The  Lakenheath Alliance for Peace group said the two were attempting to deliver a letter to commanders at the base.  The group is asking that nuclear weapons not be returned to US Air Force (USAF) base at RAF Lakenheath.Suffolk Police said two women, aged in their 70s, were arrested on 20 July and have been released on police bail. 
The peace group said five women initially walked onto an area designated as belonging to the base. When asked to leave, three did and the two who remained were arrested. A camp is currently in place outside the base until 25 July protesting against nuclear weapons. It comes after a document stated work was underway in preparation for the Lakenheath base's "upcoming nuclear mission", although the USAF has not commented on this.
