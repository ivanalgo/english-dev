Kent council leaders have warned the new government of the need for "urgent action" to reduce potential disruption across the county when new EU border checks are introduced.The Entry Exit System (EES), which is due to take effect on 10 November, will require British visitors to the EU to register biometric information.In a letter to Transport Secretary Louise Haigh on Wednesday, council leaders warned that the checks "threaten to result in extremely serious delays" for international trade and travellers.The Department for Transport said it was "reviewing the preparations that have been made so far" and "working closely with the European commission, local authorities and agencies, as well as the travel industry".
Preparations for the new system are under way at major Channel crossing points, including the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel's Folkestone site, in an attempt to prevent queues.Leaders from 14 councils in Kent - Kent County Council, Medway Council and 12 district and borough councils - asked the government to "recognise the severe risk of disruption".
"We also need you to support us in finding and funding new long-term, sustainable ways to manage cross Channel traffic, and to ensure that Kent has the infrastructure in place to ensure that ESS checks do not have a devastating impact," the letter said.The new checks - which will take place in person at ports and stations - mean passports no longer need to be stamped, but fingerprints and a photo will need to be taken.Travellers will also need to answer some questions about their journey.Kent leaders asked the government for access to data modelling, timelines and mitigations already in development "as a matter of urgency".
They also called for the government to work with the EU "to find a technological solution" to allow the Port of Dover to process passengers more quickly on and off-site.The DfT said: "The new Government is reviewing the preparations that have been made so far ahead of EES being introduced by the EU.“This includes making sure ports and carriers have the right technology and processes in place so EES registration can take place as smoothly as possible.“We are also working closely with the European commission, local authorities and agencies as well as the travel industry to ensure they’re preparing effectively for the introduction of the EU’s new border checks.”
