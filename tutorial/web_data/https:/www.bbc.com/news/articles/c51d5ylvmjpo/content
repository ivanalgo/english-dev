A 70-year-old man living with Parkinson’s disease is doing 1,000 press-ups every day throughout January.Richard Longthorp is doing the challenge to raise money to pay for boxing classes for Parkinson's patients in Hull and Goole. On one occasion, he completed his 1,000 press-ups in 56 minutes. Speaking about his month-long challenge Mr Longthorp, 70, from Howden, said: “The word I use to describe it is relentless.”Mr Longthorp was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease seven years ago. Last year he took up boxing classes at St Paul’s Boxing Academy in Hull to help manage his symptoms. “I want to do everything I can to delay the progression of the disease," he said. "The co-ordination of the arms, the punches, the combinations; it really stretches the mind and the body.”Mr Longthorp said that the money raised through the press-ups challenge would go to St Paul’s Boxing Academy in Hull and Goole Amateur Boxing Club. 
Mike Bromby, head coach at St Paul’s Boxing Academy, said exercises in the Parkinson’s classes are largely the same as in normal boxing classes.This includes circuit training, bag work and kettle bells. Other members of the Parkinson’s group also said they had felt the benefits of boxing training.Gillian Smith said: “I am a lot faster, I don’t forget things often and I can move more.”James Hyam, who also attends the classes, added: “It helps with your footwork. The bag work also helps you get out the aggression.” 
Mr Longthorp set a fundraising target of £8,000 and said he would also donate some of the money to the charity Parkinson’s UK. In a statement, Parkinson's UK said research had found "offering group-based, Parkinson's-specific boxing sessions that are adaptable, varied and that encourage social support and networking may be beneficial to increasing motivation for physical activity in people with Parkinson's."Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
