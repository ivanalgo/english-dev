A funeral director from Bridgnorth has co-authored a children's book discussing death, grief and funerals.John Adams, whose mother died when he was 12, worked with author Clare Shaw to write Donâ€™t Tell The Children.In it, Mr Adams discusses his experiences with loss and how his father had honest discussions with him about grief."I am aware that it's a very sensitive topic but it's the only topic that will affect us all in society," he said.
Mr Adams, who helps run his family's funeral directors, said it was important to have conversations about death with young people when arranging and conducting funerals."These things that we do now can have a profound impact on our future selves," he told BBC Radio Shropshire."I hope that [the book] will show people there's another way we can grieve and go through bereavement."Don't Tell The Children also discusses small acts that can help young people with the grieving process, like offering the opportunity for them to see a coffin."It's not saying every young person should be involved," he said."It's just saying that we need to have conversations. Some young people don't want to be involved."We need to listen and show everybody that their voices matter."
The book ties in to Mr Adams' campaign to introduce bereavement lessons in schools.In 2023, he launched a petition which reached more than 10,000 signatures. It was due to be debated in Parliament on Monday but was postponed due to the general election.
"We're living in a more clinical society now, even accepting death is a very difficult thing for us all," Mr Adams said."I really believe there's a societal, cultural shift on the horizon, and actually the impact of that isn't scary and doom and gloom. "It's a more compassionate kind of society for us to live in."
