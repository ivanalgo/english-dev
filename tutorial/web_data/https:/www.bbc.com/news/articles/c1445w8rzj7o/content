A Nottinghamshire town’s biggest car park is set to close for five days.Bridgford Road’s 153-space facility, in West Bridgford, will be shut to drivers from Monday 10 June.Rushcliffe Borough Council says the closure is needed for “essential resurfacing and maintenance work” and realignment of parking bays.The authority adds that Nursery, Albert Road and Gordon Road car parks remain open, while temporary parking is being set up on Bridge Field nearby, weather permitting.
The car parks run by the council in West Bridgford saw parking charges increased on 1 May.Borough councillor Rob Inglis said: “We apologise for any inconvenience caused by this temporary closure for the duration of the works to allow a contractor on site each day.“The works have deliberately been scheduled to not clash with local sports or larger events and we’re very much aware of the knock-on effect this will have on the town centre.“Business owners and our partners at Bridgford Hall have been notified of the plans and are informing customers, wedding bookings and other parties so they can make other arrangements.“We encourage the use of public transport wherever possible.”Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
