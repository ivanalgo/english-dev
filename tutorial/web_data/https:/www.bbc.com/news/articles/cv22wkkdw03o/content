Ramblers and dog owners are being warned to look out for baby deer.Waverley Borough Council, in Surrey, said adults and fawns may be hiding in long grass in Farnham Park.The authority is asking people who see fawns not to touch them.It also said dogs should be kept under close control.
The RSPCA said: "It's normal for baby deer to be left alone for long periods of time from an early age. Their mother will return to feed them, usually around dusk."If you find a baby deer on its own, don't touch or cover it, as it might affect how the mother responds to it when she returns."If you can, come back in 24 hours to see if the fawn has moved on. If the fawn is still there after 24 hours, please contact us."
