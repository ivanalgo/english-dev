There is no chance of a Derry Girls reunion any time soon, Irish actor Nicola Coughlan has said. She said the hit sitcom's three episodes were "three and done... a perfect little time capsule". The Bridgerton star was speaking to BBC News NI as she attended the Dublin premiere of the eagerly awaited second half of the period drama's third season. She said she was "forever privileged" to have been a part of Derry Girls.
