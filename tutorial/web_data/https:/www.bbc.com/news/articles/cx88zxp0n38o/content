Fly-tippers in Barnsley could face increased fines of up to £1,000 as part of plans to reduce litter and "environmental blight" across the borough.The move - which would see a 150% rise on the current penalty - was designed to hit culprits in the pocket, Barnsley Council said.A report to councillors said the higher penalties were aimed at "those more likely to fly-tip as a criminal enterprise".If the changes are given the go-ahead, other offences such as graffiti, would also attract bigger fines.
The report to the council's cabinet outlines the authority's planned new litter and environmental crime plan, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.According to the document, Barnsley Council spent £265,000 on clearing and disposing of litter and fly-tipping in 2022-23.As well as the proposed increase for fly-tipping offenders, fines would rise for those  involved in graffiti and for households which disposed of waste via unlicensed carriers, the report added.Under the proposed scheme, two tiers of fines for fly-tipping would be introduced, with the fine for dumping up to six bags of waste remaining at £400, but anyone caught fly-tipping more facing a fine of up to £1,000.Meanwhile, people involved in graffiti would face a new maximum fine of £200, up from £100.
The report said that in 2023-24, Barnsley Council issued 1,225 fixed penalty notices for environmental offences and prosecuted seven offenders for fly-tipping and duty of care offences.The authority also seized 11 vehicles, crushed one vehicle and completed its first prosecution for an abandoned vehicle. The report added: “Litter and blight affect how safe and satisfied people feel with where they live."Environmental crime is identified year after year as a priority for the people of Barnsley."Litter has also been recognised as a significant determinant of how satisfied tenants are with the place they live.”If approved, the new level of fines is expected to be introduced in August.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
