King Charles III took time to chat with well-wishers and air cadets as he attended church in Sandringham. The King, who was not joined by his wife Queen Camilla, stopped to speak with several members of the public as he walked to the church on the Royal Family's Norfolk estate. More than 100 people turned out to see King Charles, 75, as he attended a service at St Mary Magdalene Church in the summer sun.Members of the public said the monarch, who is continuing to receive treatment following a cancer diagnosis, was "looking a lot better". 
After the service, he walked down the steps from the church and took time to speak with Flt Lt Pauline Petch and a line-up of air cadets from 42F Squadron.She has overseen the local RAF cadets for 20 years and is retiring next week with the Sandringham Flower Show her last duty on Wednesday.It is understood the King and Queen are unable to attend the flower show due to existing diary commitments.
Flt Lt Petch, of Middleton near King's Lynn, said she sent the King a card from the squadron when his cancer diagnosis was made public.She said it meant "a lot" to have been invited to the church gate."It's an honour to be down here," she added.She said the King thanked her for what she had done."He spoke to each of the cadets so well and asked them so many different things about their schooling and about what they get from cadets," she said."He's so interested and always has been."
After speaking with the cadets, the King, walked back to Sandringham House, speaking to well-wishers along the way.Joanne Barker, from Pleasley in Derbyshire, said: "I think he looks a lot better. I admire him so much."Even just to talk to people, he's amazing, but I think he looked a lot better than he has done."He was walking quite well. I think he seemed in good spirits, he was lovely and he had a laugh with us."
