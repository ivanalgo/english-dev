Trees in a Nottinghamshire cemetery are at risk of being felled after vandals drilled holes and poured diesel into them.Police launched an appeal after 12 lime trees in Manton Cemetery in Worksop were targeted.The trees, which are about 120 years old, have started to die and might have to be removed if they cannot be saved.The force said work would cause “significant disturbance” to nearby graves that date back hundreds of years.
A statement on West Bassetlaw Police's Facebook page added: "These historic trees, which are around 120 years old, have stood since the cemetery's opening and are vital to the site's heritage. "The graves near these trees date back even further."Police said the trees were targeted between the beginning of March until 6 June.Bassetlaw District Council said the trees, which back on to houses in Forest Lane, will "probably" have to be felled.
Richard Bell, a tree officer for the council's park and open spaces team, said: “Somebody has drilled into 12 mature lime trees and poured some liquid into them. It’s put the trees into decline, and it looks like they’re going to die.“I don’t think they’re going to come back; it’s just a case of seeing what happens. They probably would need to get felled. They’ve approximately drilled in five inches and then poured the liquid into it.“We will see how many of the lime trees die, and then we will determine how many will have to be replaced, but it will take a couple of generations before they can get up to a [similar] height.”It comes after five trees in the same area were damaged with an axe and a saw last year, the council said.Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
