A pair of peregrine falcons have been spotted rearing their young next to a power station's tower.The birds, which are protected and were considered endangered until recently, set up home by Hartlepool's EDF power station.Ross Nuttall, environment group head at the plant, said his office window looked directly onto the nesting site and he had been able to observe the family."Every day for the past few weeks we’ve been treated to amazing views of them as they take flight and learn to hunt," he said.
The station's camera picked up the presence of three chicks, but one sadly died, Mr Nuttall said."Of course it was sad to see that it had died but knowing there are two more healthy youngsters and a pair of, presumably, happy parents too is a nice thing to see."
The company said peregrine falcons had occasionally nested at the site in the past, but with mixed results.The birds have been spotted at the Hartlepool plant since 2015 but only one bird was seen last year, making this year's family all the more special.Mr Nuttall said: "Sometimes you can hear them as well screeching at one another, looking like they are playing in the air, it’s been a lovely sight."The area around the power station is home to a wide variety of birds, the company said, with dozens of species nesting on land around the station every year.They said this year's monitoring of the area had also identified a gadwall duck breeding nearby - a first for the station.
