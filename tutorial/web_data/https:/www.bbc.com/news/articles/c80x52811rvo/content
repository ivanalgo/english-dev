Children are being urged to take part in a summer reading challenge in Slough.The free challenge is being held for children aged between four and 11 at libraries across the town as part of a national initiative.Children can read their own choice of books and they will be rewarded with medals and certificates.Councillor Puja Bedi said the project will encourage children to "read more books and to take an interest in the library".
Last year more than 685,000 children across the UK participated in the summer reading challenge.Mr Bedi added: “Hopefully the little incentives along the way will encourage more people than ever to take part.”
