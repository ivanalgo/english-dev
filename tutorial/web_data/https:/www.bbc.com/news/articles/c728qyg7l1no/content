There is no evidence that the closure of three tips in the Bradford district has led to an increase in fly tipping, the council has said. The local authority closed household waste sites in the Ilkley, Crossflatts and Ford Hill areas earlier this year as part of cost-saving measures. The council said despite a "perception" fly-tipping had risen since the closures, it had "not seen an increase". The issue was raised at a council meeting by an opposition Green party councillor, who asked if "likely additional costs" for dealing with extra fly-tipping had been budgeted for after the tips had closed.
In response, councillor Sarah Ferriby, executive member for healthy people and places, said there was "no data to suggest that residents would or are fly-tipping as a result" of the closures.According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Ms Ferriby added: "Fly-tipping is an illegal activity which will lead to prosecution of the offender. Fly-tipping volumes have not increased but are always monitored throughout the year.”All three tips were closed for good at the end of March in a move to save £900,000 a year. The closures formed part of a package of measures to save the council £40m, which was put together in a bid to avoid bankruptcy.
