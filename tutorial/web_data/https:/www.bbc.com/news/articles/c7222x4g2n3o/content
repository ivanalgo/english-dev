Jersey's health service has contacted a number of patients for "precautionary" further tests after concerns there may have been "false negatives" on breast screenings.The Royal College of Radiologists and the British Society of Breast Radiologists reviewed the work of one radiologist - after another staff member raised questions about their work.Health and Community Services (HCS) said it had invited 20 patients, out of 2,798 reviewed, to come for further tests - and had contacted another 14 people where there may have been a delayed diagnosis.Simon West, HCS deputy medical director, said he was "very sorry" for any anxiety this may have caused.
He said HCS had apologised to any patients who had been recalled or who had a delayed diagnosis, and said it would ensure they were all seen within the next few days.Mr West added: "It’s very important that healthcare staff feel free to speak up internally when they see something they think is not quite right. "And when somebody raises questions about the practice of a colleague it is vitally important these matters are taken seriously by HCS, fully considered, and thoroughly investigated. "That is exactly what has happened in this case.”
HCS said "out of an abundance of caution, and with patient safety as its number one priority", it had decided to undertake an independent review of the diagnosis of 2,798 patients who had a mammogram by the radiologist concerned - from the beginning of their employment in 2019.It said the radiologist concerned had now ceased undertaking mammograms and ultrasound diagnostic tests, and their clinical practice was restricted to areas where it was considered to be safe - CT scans, MRI scans and X-ray diagnostics.It said patients were being recalled as a "precautionary check" rather than due to any missed abnormalities in their earlier imaging.The health service also said patients who may have had a delayed diagnosis were "already well aware" of their personal diagnosis and were simply being informed of the fact there may have been a delay in their diagnosis.It added anyone in Jersey who was concerned about their mammogram, who had not already heard from HCS, could be reassured the issue did not affect them.The health department said the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) could give confidential advice, support and information on health-related services or care.The service is open Monday to Friday 08:00 to 16:00, and can be contacted by phoning 01534 443515 or by emailing at PALS@health.gov.je.
