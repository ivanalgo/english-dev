A woman who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday has said the secret to a long life is “to work hard, be happy and love more”.Gladys Gell lives at the MHA Hartcliffe in Bristol and marked her birthday on 30 May with a party at the care home, complete with banners, balloons and baked goods.In honour of Ms Gell, staff hosted a tea party with live entertainment, to which she wore a tiara and 'Birthday Queen' sash, made by the staff.Administration manager, Angela Osbourne, said: "When we asked her age, she kept saying 21. She also said ‘all this for little old me?'" 
MHA Hartcliffe provides nursing care for 65 residents, and has cared for Ms Gell, who was a nurse for the NHS, since last year.She was joined at the party by other residents and her family, including daughter Helen, son-in-law John, as well as her grand and great-grandchildren."She wasn’t expecting the party but knew it was her birthday," said Ms Osbourne.Ms Gell moved to the care home from supported living in Nottingham to be nearer to her son and daughter, who live in Bristol and Salisbury.“Gladys really enjoyed her birthday party," Ms Osbourne continued."We had Johnny Smyth Sings come along and entertain everyone for her and we all sang to her. She loved the music and singalong, and the attention."On top of the festivities, several bouquets of flowers were delivered from friends and family, including one from her grandson in America.
