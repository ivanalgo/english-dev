The Princess of Wales will attend the Wimbledon men's final on Sunday, Kensington Palace has confirmed.This will be only her second public appearance following her cancer diagnosis and abdominal surgery earlier this year.Last month, Catherine attended Trooping the Colour, and was seen smiling and waving from the Buckingham Palace balcony.On Sunday the princess will present the winner of this year's men's singles tournament with the trophy.
She has been a patron of the All-England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club for the past eight years. This year's men's final is between last year's champion Carlos Alcaraz and seven-times Wimbledon winner Novak Djokovic.In June, the princess said of her cancer diagnosis that she was making "good progress" but was "not out of the woods yet".That was the most significant update on her health since revealing in March that she had cancer.In a statement at that time, she said: “As anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,” she said, adding her treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months."I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal."While the princess attends the tennis final, the Prince of Wales will be in Berlin for the Euro 2024 final between England and Spain. The trophy for Saturday's women's final will be presented by Wimbledon All-England Club chairwoman Debbie Jevans to either Jasmine Paolini or Barbora Krejcikova.
