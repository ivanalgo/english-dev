A former Devon and Cornwall Police sergeant committed gross misconduct when he engaged in sexual behaviour with a member of the public, a hearing has concluded.Former police Sgt Steven Gardner was suspended from duty following a report about his behaviour which was made in August 2021. He retired from the force in December 2021, while under investigation.On 20 May 2024, the panel at a public misconduct hearing ruled that if he had still been serving, he would have been dismissed.His details have been submitted to the College of Policing barred list, the force said.
The panel found he had breached the standards of professional behaviour in respect to honesty and integrity, authority, respect and courtesy and discreditable conduct.Supt Jo Arundale, from the force’s professional standards department, said: “We expect all officers and staff to conduct themselves in line with the code of ethics and standards of professional behaviour. "Former police Sgt Steven Gardner has been found for not aligning with those standards and the panel ruled that his actions amounted to gross misconduct and the only suitable outcome would have been dismissal had he still been a serving officer.“Ensuring the highest standards and ethics within the force remains a top priority and the public can be assured that any wrongdoing or unacceptable behaviour such as this will be subject to robust action."
