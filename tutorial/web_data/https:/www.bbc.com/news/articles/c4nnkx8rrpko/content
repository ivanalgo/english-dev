Businesses in Stamford Bridge have said their trade has dropped by a third since the main road through their village closed.The single-lane stone bridge shut to traffic for essential repairs on 20 May with a signed diversion in place.Traders said that while they are asking people to support local, it “feels like a ghost town”.East Riding of Yorkshire Council said every effort has been taken to plan and advertise the official diversion route.
Gemma Baker owns The Square Bakehouse on The Square, and said her business is being impacted by the lack of passing trade going to and from the coast.She said her friend has had to put a sign up at the side of the bakery saying all businesses are open to attract more customers.“We tried to open some extra days but sometimes it’s costing more to open, so we are still kind of losing out in that way," Ms Baker said.“The first week was bizarre as it was kind of like zombie apocalypse as there was just very few people about.
Across the road is No 10 Café Bar and Bistro, which has also seen trade drop by a third because of a lack of customers on their way to the coast.Supervisor Caroline Lane said she is also concerned that some members of the community who live on one side have been cut off from accessing local facilities on the other side.She wants to see a shuttle bus in operation to help people get around.She said: “Communication between the various agencies that have been involved could have been thought out better to help the overall community to realise the impact it’s having on everybody.”The council said it can't introduce a shuttle bus, but added "local bus services are still running, and the footbridge next to the road bridge is still open".
Ms Baker said businesses have spoken to the council about getting more and bigger signs as there are still problems with HGVs blocking roads.She said: “You get at least half a dozen HGVs a day backing up and then going on the roads and pavements.“It’s a huge problem for Buttercrambe Bridge, where it’s just blocked constantly."Work on the 300-year-old bridge, which carries the A166 over the River Derwent, is expected to take 10 weeks, but Caroline said there is concern that it could take longer.
Although a spokesperson for East Riding of Yorkshire Council has not confirmed an official completion date, they have said they are halfway through the project and repairs are on course to finish on time.They add that extra signs have been installed on the A1079 and the A166, encouraging HGVs to follow the diversion and avoid smaller roads.The council said it is urging businesses needing advice and information on existing grants to get in touch.
