Chloe Cameron, head of activities at the home, said she wanted people to be able to make new friends. "We're helping get people involved, get them out about more and it's always nice to have a good meal and not have to do the dishes afterwards."The home has also offered to pick people up who are unable to make the journey themselves.
Resident Ivor Simmons, 99, was keen to meet new people."It's a good idea to have someone in and have a chat - they might have a fantastic background," he said.
Trevor and Kate Knight who took up the invitation said they hoped others take inspiration from the initiative."There are many lonely people. Those who are not lonely shouldn't just be happy that they're not lonely but consider those who are," said Mr Knight.
