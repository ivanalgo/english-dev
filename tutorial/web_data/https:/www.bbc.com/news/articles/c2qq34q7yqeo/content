A nesting dove has found an unlikely home inside the sculpture of a wild horse. The life-size sculpture is one of two created by artist, Michelle Reader, and sits outside The Harley Foundation, an arts centre near Worksop, Nottinghamshire. Since they were installed, the sculptures have been popular with visitors, according to the venue. Now they appear to have attracted a dove that has built a nest inside the body of the one of the artworks. 
The dove took up residence on Monday and the Harley Foundation said it had since asked visitors to observe it from a distance. Artist Ms Reader, created the pieces entirely from recycled materials to highlight the links between the things people consume and the destruction of wildlife habitats. She said: "I love the unpredictability of discarded objects, and the inventiveness necessary to transform them into a sculpture. "The medium is a big part of the message, so the materials I use vary widely."The Harley Foundation has asked asked visitors to help them name the nesting bird with suggestions so far including "Neigh-omie, Duchess and Whinny".Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
