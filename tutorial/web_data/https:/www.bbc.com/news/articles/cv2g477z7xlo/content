An MP has told of her shock after a well known carpet retailer announced that more than 1,500 staff were set to lose their jobs.Carpetright was founded by Lord Philip Harries in 1988 with its headquarters in Purfleet-on-Thames, Essex, and it has been a major employer in the area for years.About 300 people who work at the headquarters are set to lose their jobs.Thurrock MP Jen Craft urged anyone who could be facing redundancy to get in touch with her if they required support or guidance.
Carpetright employed more than 1,800 people and had 273 shops before it became insolvent.Tapi Carpets & Floors has bought the Carpetright name, its intellectual property, two warehouses and 54 stores, saving 308 jobs."It is not really something you want to happen in the first few weeks of your job," Ms Craft said. "I have a hell of a lot of sympathy. It came as a bit of a shock to some people."She said the announcement had not surprised her given the trajectory of the business, but added: "The suddenness of what took place has come as a bit of a blow."It is a very large employer that has gone and there is a concern as to what will replace that and what else is available out there."No-one likes to see a company that has employed a significant amount of people in an area go like that - it's a real shock."
Ms Craft added: "I spoke to the administrators who told me what they've put in place."I spoke to the Department for Work & Pensions, who told me that everyone should be receiving a rapid redundancy advice and support package."She said she had also spoken to other businesses in the area to see if they could absorb some of the redundancies."I would like them to get in contact with me to make sure that things people have told me are happening and actually take place," she said.
