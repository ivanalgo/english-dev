A new electronic prescription system - which hopes to reduce waiting times at the hospital pharmacy and improve patient safety - is being rolled out in Jersey.Most prescriptions will now be submitted electronically to the hospital pharmacy through the Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Administration (EPMA) system.The majority of patients will no longer receive a paper prescription.Health and Community Services (HCS) said the change was part of an ongoing commitment to streamlining processes and improving medication safety and operational efficiency.
There are a few exceptions where paper prescriptions will continue to be issued, and HCS said the relevant services were aware of what exceptions applied.Kevin Smith, pharmacy services manager, said: "The pharmacy dispenses around 800 items a day, with up to 250 people attending at the outpatient pharmacy every working day. "For our small, dedicated pharmacy team, electronic prescribing makes it easier and safer to screen, process, and supply medication."He also said that "because pharmacy staff are not trying to decipher handwritten prescriptions, the risk of medication errors is reduced".
