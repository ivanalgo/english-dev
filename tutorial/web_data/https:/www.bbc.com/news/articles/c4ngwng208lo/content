Metal statues depicting both soldiers and members of the public have gone on display on Salisbury Plain.The artwork, near Bratton on the edge of the plain, was commissioned for the Ministry of Defence's Respect the Range campaign, which aims to make people aware of the dangers of going onto military land.Hundreds of people wander into the vicinity of military training operations on the 94,000 acres of the Salisbury Plain Training Area (SPTA) every year, potentially putting their lives at risk while training exercises take place nearby.  Brig Gavin Hatcher CBE, head of the Defence Training Estate, said: "Military training can take place round-the-clock and MoD land can go from calm to combat at a moment’s notice."
He added: "By working together, we can ensure the public and our military keep each other safe."Brig Hatcher said: “At a time of heightened tensions across the globe, war in Europe and conflict in the Middle East, it’s imperative that our military undertake crucial training safely and uninterrupted."He added after training exercises there was always a risk some munitions were left behind and "so there could be unexploded ordnance on the ground". 
Rifleman Izzy O’Malley is one of the soldiers on which the military "giants" were modelled."I think they're incredible and have such likeness to what we look like," she said.“We had to stand there for a few hours in different positions, to make sure they got the likeness." Looking around the site, she added: “This is an army training area. "Seeing how many civilians there are here, you can see how important it is to be safe for us and for them."
The MoD has issued guidelines to help keep people safe on military land:
Dan Barton, head of charity Standing with Giants, said: “We’re incredibly proud to work with the MoD to promote Respect the Range."Our ethos is about honouring and respecting those who have and continue to make the ultimate sacrifice."The freedoms we enjoy were hard fought for, and our military need to train to ensure those freedoms remain.”
