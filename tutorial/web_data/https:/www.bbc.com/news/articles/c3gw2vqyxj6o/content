A "baby boom" of orphaned animals has left a charity with its "cupboards almost bare". The RSPCA East Winch Wildlife Centre in Norfolk, said "orphan season" had taken hold and it was trying to help hundreds of animals, including hedgehogs, owlets, fawns, seal pups and bats, which had been brought to the organisation. Evangelos Achilleos, its centre manager, said: "Thereâ€™s a lot of extra mouths to feed so it can sometimes feel like a creche here at the moment." He added that the centre was also caring for about 120 ducklings, 15 owlets, 20 gull chicks and 20 seals. 
"There really has been a baby boom at our centre," Mr Achilleos said."We are getting through a ridiculous number of towels and blankets because we have so many baby animals to care for - so we are asking the good people of Norfolk and further afield to help and donate unwanted linen etc which we can use."He said he was grateful to everyone "who always answers our plea for help already - having so many extra animals to feed and care for is a real challenge". "It can be an exhausting time for staff at the centre - but it always brings such a smile to our face when we receive donations to help those animals."
He said if anyone finds a young animal, it was best to check the charity's website first "to find out whether to bring them in or leave them where they are".
