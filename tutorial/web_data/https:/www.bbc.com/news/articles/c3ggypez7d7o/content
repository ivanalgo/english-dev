A county library service has launched a new scheme to allow people to borrow sports and exercise equipment free of charge.Seven libraries in Suffolk are taking part in the Move It project and organisers hope it will encourage borrowers to stay healthier and more active.Just like borrowing a book, library users can reserve sports and fitness items through an online catalogue and pick them up at their nearest library. Move It is part of Suffolk Libraries' new Arts Council England-funded Moving Minds physical wellbeing programme, which includes the Jumpstart and the Fit For Work projects.
Items available include dumbbells, resistance bands, rounders sets, footballs and cones.Libraries in Lowestoft, Woodbridge, Stowmarket, Haverhill, Newmarket are taking part as well as Gainsborough Community Library and Ipswich County Library, Other items such as swing ball, skipping ropes and yoga mats are also available from a previous initiative.Nardyne Gilardoni, project lead for Suffolk Libraries Moving Minds, said: "Helping people with their wellbeing is a huge part of what Suffolk Libraries offers to local communities. "Not everyone wants to take the first step to a healthier life – particularly when it can cost money and can be a big commitment when you’re not sure what’s right for you. "We hope offering this free loanable sports equipment, with clear guidance on how to use it, will help more people in the community stay fit, healthy, and achieve their fitness goals." Suffolk Libraries said borrowers must be 16 years or older, will need a library account and will need to sign a loan agreement form which will cover a period of six weeks.
