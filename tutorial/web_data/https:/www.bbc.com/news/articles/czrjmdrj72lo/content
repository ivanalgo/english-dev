An endurance runner has completed a challenge to run up and down the highest mountains in Scotland, England and Wales as many times as he could in 24 hours.Mallaig fish farm worker Pawel Cymbalista started with Ben Nevis in June, and managed seven runs up and back down in 20 hours and 40 minutes - a new record for the Scottish mountain.Also last month he did 11 laps of Scafell Pike in England in 21:47:52, which he believes to be a new record.On Saturday he achieved nine laps of Yr Wyddfa (formerly known as Snowdon) in Wales in 21 hours 51 minutes.
Mr Cymbalista's runs have raised funds for the Mallaig Shop and Community Hub charity.The father-of-two took up running after moving to Scotland from Poland about 10 years ago.In August, he hopes to take part in the 215-mile (346km) Race Across Scotland.Last year, Mr Cymbalista set the fastest known time for completing a long-distance walking route in the Highlands.He took just over three days to cover the 240-mile (386km) Cape Wrath Trail from Fort William to Cape Wrath.He was also the first person to finish the route unsupported, carrying all the food and clothing he needed to sustain him along the way.
