A singer-songwriter has composed a series of songs based on trees in an Isle of Wight woodland.Musician Paul Armfield's five-track EP entitled Trees was inspired by woods at Sibden Hill in Shanklin.Local conservation group Gift To Nature commissioned the work which can be listened to via QR codes in the woodland.Mr Armfield said he hoped they would allow walkers to "engage with the trees".
The five songs are about the five tree species that grow at Sibden Hill - oak, crab apple, beech, silver birch and hazel.In order to write the songs, Mr Armfield said he spent time walking in the woods as well as researching the folklore, history and poetry associated with the various species found in the copse."The woodland varies quite from one side to the other and it's got quite a nice selection of trees," he said."They each have a character - the knarly crab apple tree - their fruit is particularly unpleasant and they get a bad rap, but when you see them in blossom you realise they are part of the rose family. So they're a very special tree I think, I've become very fond of it."
Gift To Nature manages more than 30 countryside sites across the island.It said: "Sibden Hill sits right in the middle of Shanklin surrounded by housing, it's a little oasis with a good range of trees and Paul's done a fantastic job."Norwegian violinist and composer Mari Persen arranged and recorded strings for the songs, which were released last month.Mr Armfield, who also manages a bookshop on his native Isle of Wight, has released seven albums during his career and is a familiar face on the folk music circuit.
