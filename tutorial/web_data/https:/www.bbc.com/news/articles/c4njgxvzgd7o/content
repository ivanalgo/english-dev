Doctor Who actor Paul McGann has praised a convention he took part in after it raised over Â£17,000 for charity.The ninth annual Bedford Who event was held on Saturday, where fans paid for autographs and selfies with stars of the BBC television show.Money raised has been split between Bedford Foodbank, homeless charity Smart, and FACES, which supports vulnerable families.McGann, who starred in the 1996 Doctor Who TV movie, said the event had a more friendly feel to bigger, "pretty commercial" conventions he had done in America. 
He said fans gave him gifts on the day including sweets, artwork and even a naming certificate for a planet."It's been lovely, it's been friendly, we can literally look each other in the eye, I prefer that," he said.The actor, 64, told BBC Three Counties Radio he considered visiting nearby Stony Stratford, where he filmed part of the 1987 film Withnail & I.
A chemist in the town was transformed into a tea room for the black comedy, where McGann and Richard E Grant's characters drunkenly demanded cake and fine wine.He said: "It was a big deal because Withnail was filmed all in London or the Lakes except just for that little bit of Milton Keynes."Do you think if I go back to the place will anybody twig that it's me?"
Organiser Simon Danes said he was "gobsmacked" with the final amount raised and praised "the generosity of Doctor Who fans and kindness of celebrity guests".The 58-year-old said: "We were expecting about 10k but we weren't expecting it to be as high as that.Also appearing at the event was Jemma Redgrave, who recently starred on screen alongside David Tennant and new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa.The organiser added: "Jemma is so busy she doesn't do many conventions, so we honoured she has come to us. "It's the first time we had a star of the current series with us."The retired teacher added: "Next year is our 10th anniversary, so we're hoping to do something even more special, don't ask me what is yet."
