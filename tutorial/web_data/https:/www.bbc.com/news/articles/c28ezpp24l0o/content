About 40% of recycling is contaminated, a council has revealed as it launches an appeal for people to "put their waste in the right place".Redcar and Cleveland Council warned the issue at its South Bank centre was having a "significant" environmental and financial impact - costing Â£100 a tonne more to process.It is asking residents to make sure they do not put items such as plastic bags, food waste, takeaway boxes, nappies and batteries in their recycling bins.A fortnightly collection is provided for cans and tins, cardboard, plastic pots, tubs and trays, glass bottles and jars and plastic bottles, as well as paper including envelopes and newspapers.
The local authority said a recent trial in Normanby and Redcar during which instructions were tagged to recycling bins led to 15% and 20% reductions respectively in contaminated materials.Councillor Adam Brook, cabinet member for neighbourhoods, said the results showed the benefits of "working closely" with residents.He added: "The latest recycling rate for Redcar and Cleveland is approximately 33% and we want to significantly increase this as well as reduce the amount of recycling being contaminated."Contaminated recycling has a significant environmental and financial cost as the local authority is effectively paying twice for the processing and haulage of the waste."
