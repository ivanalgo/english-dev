A new GP hub is set to open in a former Sheffield bank as part of plans to transform surgeries in the city.The former Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) branch, a Grade II listed building on Church Street in the city centre, will become a £4.8m surgery.Due to open in 2025, it is the second GP hub to be created as part of a £37m city-wide scheme.Existing surgeries Primary Care Sheffield City and Mulberry, both based on nearby Mulberry Street, will move into the former bank once it has been refurbished.
In a report, Sheffield City Council said: “The building which currently houses the existing practices is not only severely deteriorating but also does not allow for future growth.“Rather than carry out an extensive upgrade on the premises, the practices will relocate."The RBS building, which dated back to the mid-1800s, has been empty since it closed in 2022.The local authority said the hub was required to address the challenges of a growing population in the area.In March 2022, the Treasury awarded £57.5m of funding to South Yorkshire to improve primary care buildings in the region, with £37m allocated to Sheffield schemes.The wider plan will also see another GP hub established in Parson Cross, replacing smaller surgeries in the area.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
