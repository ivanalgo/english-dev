There has been a "significant rise" in the number of people learning Cornish. Speak Cornish said it was hosting a variety of events to celebrate its annual drive between 22 June and 30 June.It said its Speak Cornish Week was aimed to get the language spoken in the community and this yearâ€™s theme was "a warm Cornish welcome".Run by An Rosweyth, a group of Cornish language community organisations, the events aim to encourage people to greet each other with one of the "many different Cornish welcoming words and phrases". 
"The Cornish language has seen a significant rise in the number of learners, not only across the UK, but internationally too," a statement from Speak Cornish said."With businesses and organisations also getting in on the act we decided that this was the year to make Cornish greetings the norm."As a minority language within the UK we have to work hard to get our voice heard."It added work within the language was carried out by passionate volunteers who have published textbooks, dictionaries, novels and children's books.
It said its variety of events included taster sessions for beginners, in-person and online, a litter pick, walks, a treasure trail at Heartlands, boat trip with Shanty singing and "much more".
