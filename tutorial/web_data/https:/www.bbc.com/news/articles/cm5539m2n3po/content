Councillors in the Borders have agreed to declare a housing emergency in the region.It comes after a report highlighted the "significant challenges" the local authority is facing in ensuring people have access to homes which meet their needs.Scottish Borders Council heard that the Covid pandemic and cost of living crisis had intensified housing issues across the UK.Temporary housing is at an all-time high in the region and plans to build 184 affordable homes over the next year are unlikely to be achieved.
The Local Democracy Service reported that the number of applications for social housing properties had doubled in five years – with Scottish Borders Housing Association receiving 104 bids for just five new homes at its latest development in Kelso.Councillor Julie Pirone, who supported the declaration, said: "I believe quite strongly that we are in a housing emergency."Everyday I get calls from people who cannot get on the housing ladder who are young."I get calls from people who are in over-crowded accommodation that can’t get moved and they want to be able to stay here and they want to have good housing."She said they needed to ask both the UK government and Scottish government for support in tackling the issue.
“We also have to think about those that are homeless and the refugees and the Ukrainians who also really love our region and want to stay, but who we are struggling to find homes for too," she added.Stuart Marshall said that in his 17 years as a councillor he could not remember receiving so many "desperate pleas" from people to get out of their property and into a new one because of overcrowding or the conditions."I deal with issues every single day with registered social landlords and private landlords regarding overcrowding, ageing windows, faulty heating, failed heating systems," he said.“These are all exacerbating the problems that we have got.”Members unanimously agreed to the declaration of a housing emergency.Councillors were told that by formally declaring an emergency they could "send a clear message" that action was required.
