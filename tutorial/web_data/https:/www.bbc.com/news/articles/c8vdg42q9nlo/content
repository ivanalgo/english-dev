A bridge is set to close for nine weeks to allow for repairs to be carried out.Work on Tranwell South Bridge near Morpeth is due to start on Monday with a 2.5 mile (4km) diversion in place.Northumberland County Council said the bridge carries the C150 over Catch Burn but has "insufficient capacity to accommodate the weight of some modern vehicles".The road surface will be dug up and a new reinforced concrete strengthening slab installed, while drainage and "parapet improvement works" will also be carried out.
The diversion will be in place via the B6524.Paul Jones, the council's director of environment and transport, said: "We are sorry for any inconvenience this will cause but this work will ensure the bridge is fully strengthened and improved for years to come. "We thank drivers in advance for their patience while we carry out this scheme."
