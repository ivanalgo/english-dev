Turbine blade deliveries to a wind farm in the Scottish Borders have been completed after six months.The 65m (210ft) components have become a familiar sight on the roads of the region as they were being transported to the Pines Burn site near Hawick.The deliveries have been hit by a string of problems and caused significant transport disruption in the area.Developers Energiekontor confirmed the final blade had arrived on Wednesday and thanked the public for their patience.
The deliveries started in November and special blade lifters were used to shorten the length of the load as they tackled the roads in the Borders.However, bad weather, vandalism and a vehicle breakdown slowed their progress even further.The delivery process was described by some as a "logistical nightmare" as the convoys made their way to the wind farm.The company has now wound down a special Facebook page it set up to keep the public informed of the delivery schedule.
