Dudley Council has ordered a review of two activity centres for children which are both losing money.External consultants were given the go-ahead to investigate Astley Burf Outdoor Activity Centre in Worcestershire and Sycamore Green Adventure Centre.Options considered include outsourcing services to improve financial stability, however closure has not been ruled out if a solution cannot be found.The proposals are part of money-saving measures designed to fill the borough's multi-million pound budget shortfall.
Astley Burf in Stourport-on-Severn is a school camp with facilities for 60 children and accommodation, including a cabin for children with disabilities.The budget for 2024-25 for the centre, which is in Worcestershire but run by Dudley Council, was £82,000, but in the last financial year, loss of income caused an overspend of £22,000.Sycamore Green in Upper Gornal is a registered charity and adventure centre, which offers services including toddler stay and play, go-karts, family play and inclusive play for children with disabilities.The centre’s budget for 2024/25 was £48,000, but in the last financial year, it recorded an overspend of £49,000, also due to reduced income.
The council will spend £10,000 on the review, after an initial investigation identified opportunities to increase profits at both sites.This included combining staffing and administrative, training and marketing services, and adding more facilities and increasing the variety of programmes on offer.Notes attached to the council’s decision sheet authorising the review said: "There is little to no risk in bringing in experts in the field to review operations, but a significant risk in not exploring all available options that sees the facilities remain open and available to users."
