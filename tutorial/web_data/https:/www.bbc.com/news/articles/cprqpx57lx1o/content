A Liberal Democrat MP was told he had two months to find a new home the day after he was elected to Parliament.On 5 July, the newly-elected member for Didcot and Wantage, Olly Glover, received an eviction notice from his landlords, who plan to retire and sell their property. Mr Glover, who has been renting his current home in Milton for four years, said "no fault evictions" create a "huge pressure" for renters.He said he believed there was a cultural problem in the UK where housing is seen primarily as an asset and secondarily as an affordable necessity.
Mr Glover said he supported government plans to strengthen tenant rights."It was completely unexpected," he said, reflecting on the morning that he received the letter.The MP said he had no issue with his landlords, but would like to see a process whereby homeowners have a discussion with renters, to work out a timescale, before they issue a no-fault eviction notice.
Tim Patmore was served a section 21 eviction order because his landlord wanted to refurbish the house he was renting.He said he had received forewarning from his landlord before he was given the order, but it still came as a "shock".Now, after 12 years of renting in Oxfordshire, he has managed to buy a house in Littlemore thanks to support from his family."I'm glad the government has prioritised it but I think they could do more to help," Mr Patmore said."I think they could do a hell of a lot more to make the rental market cheaper and buying a house cheaper."
The government has committed to do away with Section 21 notices, which give tenants two months’ notice of eviction without any reason.The Renters’ Rights Bill, featured in the King's Speech, includes pledges to end manufactured rental bidding wars and allow tenants to request keeping a pet – which a landlord could not unreasonably refuse.The party has also pledged to help tackle “unreasonable” rent hikes both between and within tenancies and to improve standards, tackling issues like mould, in both social and private rented homes.The National Residential Landlords Association said landlords needed the courts to operate quickly where they had a good reason to repossess a property.“The system that replaces Section 21 needs to be fair, workable and sustainable for both responsible landlords and renters.“We will work constructively with the Government as it continues to work on the detail of its plans.”
