A skunk is on the loose after escaping from his owner's garden.Ace was waiting for Vik Ellis to feed him in Great Cornard, near Sudbury, Suffolk, a week ago, but while out in the garden he made a run for it.He has since been seen in a nearby garden but has managed to evade capture.Ms Ellis said she thought Ace was probably "having the time of his life".
"He was sighted on Sunday night in a resident's garden," Ms Ellis told Jeremy Vine on BBC Radio 2."They said he appeared at their back door, but as soon as they noticed him and got up, he scurried off."She added that he was normally very friendly and playful, but he was likely to be scared of strangers."He's probably having the time of his life and running riot around the area eating people's cat food," she said."If you put some peas out for him he will be your best friend. They are his favourite thing in the world."Ace was rescued by Ms Ellis after someone got in touch to ask her for help rehoming an iguana."They also said they had a skunk they needed to rehome, and we had a farm so we had outdoor space for him to run around," Ms Ellis explained."We just felt we could offer him what he needed."
While skunks are native to North America, they can be kept as pets in the UK.Ben Gregory, founding director of Exotic Explorers in Brentwood, Essex, said they needed lots of care."The big problem with skunks [is that] they are nomadic so they love to wander and travel," he said."Most people can't provide them with the space they need, so they need to go for a wander."Ms Ellis has appealed for anyone who spots Ace to get in touch with her via Facebook.
