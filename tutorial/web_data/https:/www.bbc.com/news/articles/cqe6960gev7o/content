A council said it had noticed an increase in requests for help from homeless families with children.Fenland District Council said there had been a 20% growth in demand from young families for its homelessness service since 2020.The authority is asking people for their views on its five-year draft strategy to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping.Sam Hoy, the council's housing portfolio holder, said it had made "significant headway" in reaching its goal of zero rough sleepers in Fenland.
She said: "We face significant challenges in homelessness moving forward, with the cost-of-living crisis and those rough sleepers without recourse to public funds or those who are not ready to engage."Miss Hoy said the new strategy would be "ambitious and creative" in tackling homelessness.The main cause of homelessness in Fenland is family and friends no longer being able to house someone.Other factors include a relationship ending, the end of a private rented tenancy agreement, and domestic violence.As well as families with children, the council said it had noticed an increase in demand from people with complex needs such as alcohol, drug or mental health issues.
The council said it had prevented 257 households from becoming homeless in the year to March.In one case study highlighted in its draft strategy, a man in his 40s was helped after his relationship broke down and an arrangement to stay in his former mother-in-law's garage ended.Over time, he was transferred to a GP in Wisbech and began volunteering for a local organisation called the Ferry Project, and was given accommodation closer to his children.A mother with one son from outside Fenland, who was experiencing domestic violence, was also highlighted in the report for being given a safe alternative property in the area.The draft strategy is available online and a public consultation on the document closes on 15 September.
