The deputy manager of a care home who defrauded an elderly resident of more than Â£40,000 has been jailed.Nikola Penevski, 35, of Walsh Avenue, Hengrove, Bristol, admitted to abusing his position at Rosedale House Care Home to make withdrawals from the bank account of the vulnerable victim.Bristol Crown Court heard how he used the victim's bank card to withdraw money between January and December 2022 until his activity was flagged by the bank.Penevski, who pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position in June, was sentenced to 27 months in prison on Wednesday.
Penevski was arrested at Heathrow Airport in January 2023 on his return from a trip abroad.Avon and Somerset Police Det Con Daniel Britton said the victim died in March last year before Penevski had "acknowledged his culpability"."Penevski was uniquely placed, given his position within the care home, to fraudulently obtain tens of thousands of pounds of the victim's money," he said."The victim had come to the home because he needed additional care, was particularly vulnerable and had no support network available to him. "Penevski gained his trust and then exploited that vulnerability."
