A council has said its staff are spending about four days a month collecting life rings that have been thrown into ponds and lakes.The rise in vandalism has mainly been seen at Anton Lakes in Andover, Hampshire, according to Test Valley Borough Council.Upgraded safety equipment is being piloted across country parks in the area.It means 999 will have to be dialled before the life-saving kit can be accessed.
Each station contains a throw line, which users can access by calling emergency services and providing the location reference displayed on the unit. The call handler will give them a code to access the device.
Councillor Terese Swain, lead for community, leisure and tourism, said: "Every time somebody removes a life ring for anything other than helping someone in need, they could be putting another life at risk."While we go through the process of upgrading this equipment across our sites, I would appeal to anyone who thinks of tampering with this equipment to consider that they could inadvertently contribute to someoneâ€™s death."Hampshire fire service suggested the change after raising fears missing safety equipment posed a risk to life.Rikki Noble, Test Valley station manager, issued a reminder on what to do  if someone is in trouble in the water."The best way to help is by staying calm, staying on land, and remembering Call, Tell, Throw: call 999 for the emergency services, tell the struggling person to float on their back, throw them something that floats."
