A council has said that an amusement ride can stay on a seafront after concerns were raised that its appearance caused "harm to the heritage" of the area.The Slingshot ride has been a part of the Golden Mile in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, during the summer season since 2017.An officer from Great Yarmouth Borough Council objected to it receiving planning permission until 2026, on the basis that the ride - particularly the fencing around it - aesthetically harmed the seafront.Councillors from the authority said the ride could remain as long as the fencing was replaced.
In a report to the council’s development committee, the authority’s conservation officer said the ride “does generate a level of harm to the character and appearance" of the area.The officer conceded that the attraction was “not uncommon within a seaside location” but said the harm was exacerbated by temporary fencing placed around the base of the ride.Councillors granted permission for the Slingshot to remain in the area, on the condition that approved fencing was installed as a replacement by March next year.Gary Boyd, a Conservative councillor who represents Caister North, praised the committee's decision.He said: “Anything that brings people to the town and seafront and improves our tourism offer is a positive.“It is important we have businesses like this along Marine Parade that entice people to visit.”
