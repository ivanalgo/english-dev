Two schools and a leisure centre have been forced to close after a pipe burst on a main road.Southern Water said the issue in Wildern Lane in Hedge End, Hampshire, affected the supply to 110 properties.Shamblehurst Primary, Wildern School and the leisure centre on its site were closed all day.The water firm later said a faulty device, which caused the problem by creating high pressure had been replaced and supplies were returning to normal.
Previously, it said teams were on site making repairs and bottled water was being delivered to those without supplies.It also said water was being pumped into the system from tankers to try to maintain supply to as many customers as possible.
Wildern School said the burst main on the road outside meant there was no water to the building or access to the site.The school later reported on its website: "The water company has said they are confident that we can open the school tomorrow."They have stated that there will be temporary traffic lights outside of the school on Wildern Lane for a week as they continue the repairs."Southern Water previously said high pressure had caused several leaks in the area at the same time.It said 710 properties in Lower Northam Road and Allan Road had suffered low water pressure or intermittent supplies.
