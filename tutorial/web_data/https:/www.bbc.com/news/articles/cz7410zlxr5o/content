Riverside residents and businesses have been told flooding is expected due to high tidal water moving upstream from the coast.The Environment Agency issued a flood warning for the River Yare in Norfolk, including Cantley, Brundall and Reedham.It said the natural tide locking effect would restrict normal drainage of the river system out to sea at low tide on Saturday and into Sunday."Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger," it said.
Affected roads include Ferry Road in Reedham, the A47 and the railway line between Reedham and Brundall.
