People who fled their countries due to persecution or war have created an exhibition on the theme of home.Forty asylum seekers from across Hertfordshire shared their artwork and writing in a project organised by Herts Welcomes Refugees.Helen Singer, from the charity, said the feeling of home and "being with your family came through very strongly". The artworks are being displayed on the railings outside St Albans Museum + Gallery.
The exhibition, called Visions of Home, has been organised to coincide with Refugee Week.Ms Singer said the charity felt the week was an opportunity to talk about the refugees it supported and raise awareness about its work. "But we didn't want people to feel sad about what they'd left - that it's more than a physical place - and that comes across, it's a feeling," she said."One of the quotes was lovely, saying, 'Home is a place of love where family come together' and that feeling of being with your family came through very strongly."
Contributors ranged in age from four to adults and came from at least 14 different countries. Ms Singer said she was "incredibly impressed" by the way the child refugees wrote "such amazing English" after just 18 months in the UK and the exhibition was designed to show "the resilience of refugees".She added Herts Welcomes Refugees supported hundreds of refugees of all ages, who come and go across the county, as they are moved into different accommodation or are given leave to remain and evicted from their accommodation with 30 days' notice. Those supported include Afghans through the government's citizens resettlement scheme, Iranians, Albanians and Turkish Kurds.
