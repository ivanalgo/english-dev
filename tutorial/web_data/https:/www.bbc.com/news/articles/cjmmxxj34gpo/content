The man in charge of the Aldeburgh Festival who was recently awarded a knighthood will step down from his role at a charity using music to change lives.Sir Roger Wright has been chief executive of Britten Pears Arts in Snape, Suffolk for the past 10 years.Earlier this month he was named in the King's Birthday Honours for services to music, which he said left him "overwhelmed and humbled".Sir Roger will finish hosting his final Aldeburgh Festival of Music and the Arts on Sunday before he steps down from his role at the charity.
"I'm particularly keen to stress that it's really a recognition for all of my colleagues at Britten Pears Arts," Mr Wright said about his knighthood. "The citation talked particularly about the last 10 years and the time during the pandemic and I do feel it's a recognition for their hard work and commitment."He added when he received the letter informing him of the news, it was a moment he would "never forget".Sir Roger, a former director of BBC Radio 3, said it was the right time for him to move on from Britten Pears Arts. Asked what he thought his legacy might be, he explained: "I never think about my personal legacy might be."All I try to do is work with my colleagues and keep the organisation in as good of health as it possible can be."The Aldeburgh Festival, in its 75th year, started on 7 June and finishes on Sunday.Sir Roger will then finish at the charity at the end of July. "My wife said I was graduating not retiring which I thought was a great phrase," he added."I'm certainly not retiring and I'm now just thinking about how I can be most useful in terms of what the next chapter for me is."
