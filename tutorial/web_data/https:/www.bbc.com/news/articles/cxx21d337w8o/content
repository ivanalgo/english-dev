Fishermen and their families are being offered free health and wellbeing checks in a coastal town.SeaFit, which is run by Fishermen’s Mission and Seafarers Hospital Society, will visit Redcar for the first time on Monday between 10:00 and 15:00 BST.Blood pressure checks, mental health support, weight management and smoking advice will be available, as well as free financial information.The aim is to support fishermen who struggle to make and keep health appointments.
SeaFit manager Carol Elliott said fishermen often face issues with high blood pressure and dental decay because of sugary drinks they use to keep themselves awake.She said previous events around the country had "literally saved lives".Ms Elliott said dental charities told her fishermen's teeth, in general, were much worse than that of homeless people they also support."The lifestyle is very difficult because if they need to be at sea and they're working shifts or working different patterns, they very often drink a lot of the sugary drinks, or eat food that's perhaps not as healthy as it should be, to keep themselves going."
The SeaFit event will be held on the Esplanade in Redcar, opposite the Zetland café.North East England regional officer for The Fishermen's Mission Peter Dade said there had been an occasion where a fisherman got a health check and was immediately taken to hospital because of their high blood pressure.He encouraged fishermen to take part, even if it was just to "come and have a chat".
