Organisers of a children's running event are looking for help to get it off the starting blocks.Volunteers are needed to establish a Junior Parkrun to accompany the existing event for adults which takes place in Tamworth's castle grounds.The parkrun, which started last year, is run by volunteers and has more than 300 people joining in, Tamworth Borough Council said.The junior event would cater for children aged four to 14 years on Sunday mornings - with volunteer roles including marshalling, timing, and recording results.
“Parkrun is an internationally popular event and in October last year, we were delighted to work in partnership to bring the weekly event to Tamworth’s picturesque Castle Grounds," Councillor Sarah Daniels said.She added: “We’re working hard to help bring people of all ages together for regular fitness activity, and encourage more people into the town centre, which is a big focus for us at the moment.Parkrun is free of charge, and people can walk, jog, run, volunteer or spectate.People interested in volunteering are asked to email andrew.lucas@parkrun.com.
