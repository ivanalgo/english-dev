Clitheroe’s market place and the Towneley Gardens in Longridge are earmarked for upgrades as part of a range of projects by Ribble Valley Council backed by the government.Other schemes, including a village hall, play area and footpath upgrades, are included in a list of plans put forward for potential support from the government’s UK Shared Prosperity Fund.Councillors are looking at the proposals this week.At Clitheroe Market, paving resurfacing, stall upgrades, lighting and seating improvements are all proposed for the town centre site.
Councillors have been advised to allocate £250,000 to the market place work which includes the "bullring" area where livestock was sold in years gone by.  A council report states: “An alternative resin-bound material has been suggested for the inner ring of the bullring to replace the square flagstones and cobble setts. "The existing stone flags will be retained and replaced where they have been removed around the outer ring of the bullring.“It was originally proposed to re-orientate one of the central casual stalls to create more of a circular stall arrangement around the bullring. "However, this raised concerns with the traders and it is now suggested that these stalls are reintroduced following the resurfacing work.”
At Longridge, there are plans to develop a Towneley Gardens event space. A council report states a firm called DK Design Associates has put forward a £10,000 bid to the borough council to develop design ideas, visual "mood boards" and consultation. Ribble Valley councillors have been advised to approve paying £10,000 to the firm and further ideas and detailed designs will be produced.Meanwhile at Barrow, councillors are being told progress needs to be made regarding deadlines for a village hall project.Ideas include a community space, car park and an EV electric car charging point and the local parish council taking ownership of the building.Other ideas across the Ribble Valley include funding for sports tracks, St Mary’s Community Centre, Salthill play area and footpath improvements at Brungerley Park, Clitheroe.
