Declining sales and rising costs have prompted the owners of an old pub in Warminster to seek permission to convert the premises to a block of flats. Mason Arms is run by Admiral Taverns, who own 1,600 pubs across the UK.They say the pub's trading performance has been "declining and insufficient over the previous three years".Wiltshire Council is expected to make a decision in mid-September.
Admiral Taverns is hoping to convert the listed building of medieval origins to accommodation with three one-bedroom apartments, one two-bedroom apartment and two two-bedroom dwellings.They are also proposing to construct two three-bedroom houses on land to the rear of the site.The move follows poor trading at the pub for the last few years. Admiral Taverns said that sales have been "declining and insufficient over the previous three years to support a tenant, cover rent or mortgage payments, or other operating costs associated with the business, despite financial aid from the landlord‚Äù.They also add that its East Street location means the site is well-located, with easy access to public transport links and shops.
