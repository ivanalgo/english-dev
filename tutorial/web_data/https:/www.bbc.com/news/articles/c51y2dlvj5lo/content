A group is campaigning for climbing frames to be reinstalled in a playground after they were removed for safety reasons.The play equipment at Portswood Rec in Southampton, Hampshire, was taken down in 2023 after the wood was found to be decaying, but was never replaced.Friends of Portswood Rec has raised £5,000 towards the new apparatus, but said it needed more financial help.Southampton City Council, which owns and manages the park, said it was awaiting the outcome of a grant application that would help fund an "ambitious refurbishment".
May Lindsay, a parent and member of Friends of Portswood Rec, said the equipment was important because she felt children were leading more sedentary lives."There's a lot more screen time," she said."We want somewhere that appeals for them to come and be physical, come and socialise with friends."Treasurer of the group Louise Anderson said it had already raised thousands through quiz nights, bake sales and yoga events."It's been really tough because play equipment is so expensive," she said."Unfortunately, it's just not enough to replace the equipment and it's been almost a year now."
Play England, a charity that supports children's right to play, said tight budgets for councils often meant aging or broken equipment was not replaced.It added local authorities had no legal obligation to provide play apparatus.Executive director Eugene Minogue said the charity was campaigning to change that."We know local authorities can do this, but often it is the political will to be able to drive this forwards," he said.Eamonn Keogh, Southampton City Council's member for environment and transport, said: "We have been working closely for some time with Friends of Portswood Rec and are hoping to combine finances from Southampton City Council, Friends of Portswood Rec raised monies as well as grant funding for a more ambitious refurbishment. "If successful in the grant, our refurbishments are set to create a safe and fun space for all.”
