One of the UK's longest-serving academics is set to leave her university job after 58 years.Prof Joan Busfield joined the University of Essex just one year after it opened to students in 1964.To mark her distinguished career ahead of retirement, the sociologist was awarded an honorary fellowship by the Colchester-based facility."She has done so much for so long to build and sustain what makes our university so special – our community," the university's registrar Bryn Morris said.
The university had just a few hundred students when Prof Busfield joined, but it has grown to have almost 20,000 across three campuses during her time.She joined the fledgling department of sociology as a research assistant in 1965 and became its first female professor in 1992.
Prof Busfield also went on to hold the role of pro-vice-chancellor at the university - the first woman to do so."It has been a privilege and pleasure to work at the University of Essex for so many years, to experience so many exciting events, to see so many changes," she said."And in particular, to get to know so many supportive colleagues and friends."
Prof Linsey McGoey, the head of sociology at the university, said Prof Busfield had been a "trailblazing leader" in the field."She is known for being bold in speaking truth to power, as well as caring and supportive towards the many junior colleagues mentored over the years," she added.Prof Busfield was president of the British Sociological Association from 2003 to 2005. She was also a co-editor of the influential journal Sociology.Mr Morris said: “Joan symbolises everything that is great about the department, the university and what it means to graduate from Essex.“Joan has shown incredible dedication to the university and made an outstanding contribution at the heart of our university life for virtually its entire history."
