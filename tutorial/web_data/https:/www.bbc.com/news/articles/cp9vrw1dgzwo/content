A Brighton-based choir group has expressed worries over ticket sales for its charity concert, as the event coincides with the men’s Wimbledon and Euro 2024 finals.The Soul of the City Choir is to perform twice at All Saints Hove in East Sussex on Sunday evening at the same time as the two major sporting events.Vanessa Thomas, director of the Brighton-based group, said the choir faced “very, very hot competition”.“Not selling many tickets would mean the charity not really raising much money, and they do rely on help when it comes to raising awareness and funding,” she said.
“But I do have to congratulate England as they are doing so well. We’ll just have to see how it goes.”England will play in the final after they overcame the Netherlands in the semi-final on Wednesday.The choir events, which begin at 18:00 and 20:30 BST on Sunday, will see 250 singers aged between 20 and 77 take to the stage.
They will sing a variety of pop, soul and gospel songs with audience donations going to Touchbase – an organisation dedicated to helping young people recover from adverse childhood experiences.Ms Thomas said spectators can expect “lots of joy and really great singing”.“I think a lot of times when people think of choir, they have very specific views of what that means in their head,” she told BBC Radio Sussex.“But what I try and do is make it as open to as many people as possible. So I try and include as much variety as I possibly can.”
