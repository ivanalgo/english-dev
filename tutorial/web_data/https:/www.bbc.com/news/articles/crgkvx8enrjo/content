Two larger than life pottery dogs have been positioned outside Hanley town hall, as part of a project celebrating disabled workers in Stoke-on-Trent's pottery industry.The 8ft tall (2.4m) models are the largest of more than 100 dog figures placed around the city.They recreate the Staffordshire Dogs which were mass-produced by workers with disabilities and children in the Potteries in the 1800s.The creators of the trail, 104 Projects, expressed the hope the dogs would become city landmarks.
Ceramicist Alice Thatcher collaborated with more than 100 disabled people who used clay moulds from the original Victorian-era dogs for the smaller models.People with disabilities across the city were also involved in designing the statues.
Local artist Chloe Breeze created the trail map where the small dogs can be spotted and ticked off."This is a fun way for audiences to discover and understand the heritage of Stoke-on-Trent’s disabled workers and to celebrate disability and disabled artists," said Justin Edgar from 104 Projects."No two dogs are the same and we’re really proud of that celebration of individuality."We hope people will enjoy the dog trail as well as sample local businesses along the way”.
