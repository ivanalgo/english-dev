The inquest heard that the three men, from West Yorkshire, were believed to have been involved in the theft of catalytic converters from vehicles.Their stolen car came to the attention of police as it was displaying false number plates.Assistant Coroner Ian Sprakes said police followed the vehicle as it sped out of Hull on the A63 forcing other motorists out of the way.Mr Sprakes said the police abandoned the authorised pursuit when the BMW went the wrong way around a roundabout and entered the slip road towards the westbound carriageway of the A63 and headed east towards Hull.
It hit the mum-of-one's car head on near a petrol station before bursting into flames.Mr Connors was dragged out of the burning vehicle and died in hospital five days later on 27 November.Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
