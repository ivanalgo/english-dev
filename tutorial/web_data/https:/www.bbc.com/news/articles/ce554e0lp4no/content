The design of a planned apartment building in a famous university city has been described as "brutal" by a councillor.Members of Labour-controlled Cambridge City Council have approved plans for the building, which will contain almshouse apartments, in Cambridge.Liberal Democrat Katie Porrer told a planning committee meeting how she “quite liked the look of the new building”, which is due to go up in Albion Row.But Labour's Martin Smart told the meeting that he did not think the design “looked good” - and described it as “brutal”.
Councillors were told that the building would replace the former Edward House care home.The 15-bed care home closed in 2021 after it was found to be uneconomical to run.Plans for 16 "Almshouses apartments" have been put forward by The Foundation of Edward Storey, a charity which offers sheltered housing for people over 60 who are in financial need and have a link to the Church of England.The proposals were considered at a recent council planning committee meeting.
What is an Almshouse?The Almshouse Association says:
Planning officers said the proposed redevelopment offered a “high quality” scheme with a design that was “appropriate to the area”.They said it would “contribute positively to its surroundings”.Mr Smart said he was “not keen on the scheme”.Cambridge City Council is made up of  25 Labour councillors, 10 Liberal Democrats, five Greens, one Conservative, and one independent.
