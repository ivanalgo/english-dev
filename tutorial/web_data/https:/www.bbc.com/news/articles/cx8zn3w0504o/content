People should not to use roads through the grounds of Noble's Hospital to access a new community centre by car, the health department has said.Road access to the Braddan Roundhouse via hospital estate was revoked on Monday.It comes after the department issued a 28 day notice to Braddan Commissioners warning access would be withdrawn.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said vehicular access was only permitted for contractors and Braddan Commissioners staff, and all other visitors should use the pedestrian access.
A spokeswoman for the department said while there were no physical barriers in place, relevant signage would be installed in the coming days, and it "may monitor access".
The Â£10m community facility, which has been built by the local authority, has faced a number of delays. That led to a hike in the area's rates after the cost of the project spiralled.The DHSC previously said the decision to stop road access via private hospital roads was down to the "safety of service users". A department spokeswoman said pedestrians would be able to get to the Roundhouse from the hospital, but if if road access was "being abused" the DHSC "may take further action". A requisition meeting for residents about Roundhouse is set to be held at the centre on 11 March.The local authority previously said it would aim to have most of the facility's services fully operational by the end of the month.
