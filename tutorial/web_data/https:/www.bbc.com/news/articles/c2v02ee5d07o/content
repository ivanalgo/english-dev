City councillors have agreed the next steps to improve play provision across Worcester.The Worcester Play Plan was approved by the council last year and set out to "plug the gaps" in play areas and invest in them  for children over the next decade.Perdiswell and Battenhall have been earmarked to get a new outdoor play area and pump track for bikes respectively.Play facilities at Cornmeadow Lane, Weyburn Close and Pitmaston ward have been identified as needing improvements. 
Hannah Cooper from Worcester City Council said: “The Play Plan is built around the concept that play provision should be available for a range of age groups and at different locations in the city".“Consulting and engaging with people living in the area and those who will be potentially using the play facilities is important to help us design individual projects,” Ms Cooper said.More than £600,000 has already been secured for the project, and additional £4000,000 from from the Community Infrastructure Levy charged on building projects has been approved by the council to go towards the plans.Consultation is also to begin to consider how play and open spaces can be improved in the St Peter’s ward using money collected from the Taylors Lane housing development.Since the project launched, Horizon Hub on Midland Road has already been refurbished and a new playground has Cranham Drive and Chedworth Close is being built.
