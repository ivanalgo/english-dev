"Significant improvement" is needed at a specialist school in Powys, according to education watchdog Estyn.A visit by inspectors found the county council "does not have a clear strategic vision or improvement plan" for the Powys Pupil Referral Unit (PRU), which is for children needing greater support or those excluded from mainstream schools.The council said it was "drawing up an action plan... to address the recommendations made by Estyn".The authority is currently reviewing the future of PRUs and could consider closing one to make a saving of almost £600,000.
Estyn issued four recommendations in its report about the Powys PRU, which is run between sites at Brecon and Newtown:The education watchdog said it would monitor the PRU's progress for the next year.Meanwhile, the council is drawing up proposals to remodel its pupil referral units, closing one unit, to save £325,555 this year and £251,285 next year."A comprehensive business case is being completed and, therefore, no decision has been made as to what the future of the PRU provision in Powys will look like," it said.
