A 74-year-old man who tried to meet up with a 14-year-old boy with a view to sexually abusing him has been jailed for two and a half years.National Crime Agency (NCA) officers started an investigation into John Harrison after they identified him as exchanging indecent images of a child on a social media platform.Harrison, from Tipton, Dudley, was arrested in February 2021 and had a number of electronic devices seized before being released on bail.While the investigation was ongoing, the NCA said, new intelligence showed that Harrison was offending again, this time engaging with a 14-year-old boy on the same social media site.
Officers found messages suggesting he was attempting to arrange sexual activity with the child. A total of 3,772 indecent images of children were also discovered on his devices, 482 of which were in the most serious category.Harrison was arrested again and charged with offences including making indecent images of children, possession of prohibited or extreme images and arranging sexual activity with a child.He pleaded guilty at Birmingham Crown Court in March 2023 and was sentenced on Wednesday to 30 months' imprisonment.Harrison was already on the sex offenders register after being convicted in 2014 for making and possessing indecent images of children.Danielle Pownall, operations manager at the NCA, said: "John Harrison is a prolific offender, pursuing contact with children and continuing his offending even after he had been arrested."She added: "The images Harrison had been viewing and swapping with others all contain a vulnerable child who has been abused for criminals like him."The NCA is committed to protecting children and ensuring those who seek this material are brought to justice."
