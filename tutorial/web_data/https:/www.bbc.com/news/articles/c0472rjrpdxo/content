Her wound had been assessed and would require longer-term treatment, police said.The force added it was not in a position to disclose the breed of the dog, but that it had been seized by officers.
"This incident required an immediate and emergency attendance from response officers and detectives who were there within minutes," Mr Hutchinson said.He revealed that officers were "so concerned" about the girl's injuries, they took her straight to hospital themselves."This undoubtedly meant assessment and treatment for her injuries could be carried out by medical experts as quickly as possible," the officer added.
