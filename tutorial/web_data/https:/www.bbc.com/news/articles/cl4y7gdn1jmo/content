A primary school in West Sussex is to relocate to a new site.The decision to move Jessie Younghusband Primary School in Chichester to the Minerva Heights development will help to secure the future of primary education in the city, West Sussex County Council said.The move will allow neighbouring St Anthony’s School to expand and to revise the catchment areas for Jessie Younghusband Primary School, Parklands Community Primary School and Fishbourne Primary School.It follows two public consultations and is subject to a call-in period.
Relocating the school to newer, more modern buildings will create the potential for the school to expand to a two-form entry in the future, which is not possible in the current location, the council said.In addition, it will allow St Anthony’s School to be expanded, utilising the building vacated by Jessie Younghusband Primary School to create 50 places for children from across the county with special educational needs and disabilities.Councillor Jacquie Russell, cabinet member for children and young people, said “stabilising the future of primary education” was at the heart of the decision.“Relocating Jessie Younghusband to Minerva Heights is our best option to do so because the alternative of a brand-new school on the site would weaken the viability of existing schools in the city, including Jessie Younghusband, and put further pressure on all schools at time when pupil numbers are declining,” she said.“This has been a difficult decision. I appreciate the strength of feeling and understand how upsetting it can be for families who are faced with the prospect of change, both for their children and their community.“However, we have made a decision that takes into account the feedback and balances it against the broader needs of our communities as a whole.”
