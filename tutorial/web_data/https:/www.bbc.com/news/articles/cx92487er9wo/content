An inspection of West Yorkshire Police (WYP) has found that the force is "outstanding" in the way it records crime but needs to improve its investigative standards and staff support.The new report by His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) graded the force across nine areas of policing.Its inspectors praised WYP's "effective" response to preventing anti-social behaviour but said the number of crimes it solved was low.West Yorkshire Police said it would respond "positively" to the results and improve its service where needed. 
In total, the inspectorate found the force was "outstanding" in one area, "good" in one area, "adequate" in five areas and "requires improvement" in two areas.Crime recording systems were highlighted as being constantly monitored and scrutinised by senior officers.Investment in neighbourhood policing was assessed positively but the force was told to make sure it had "the right resources" in place to manage all demands.His Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary Michelle Skeer said: "I recognise the efforts of individual officers and staff in West Yorkshire Police, who are working hard to manage these high workloads and to help victims.“I hope that changes to the way the force operates will result in improvements that help West Yorkshire Police to provide a better service to the public."She added: "I will be monitoring its progress closely.”Chief Constable John Robins said: “I am reassured to see that the integrity of our crime recording has been acknowledged and it is good to see the areas of ‘promising practice’ identified across the report. "I am also pleased to see that the increasing number of people we charge with criminal offences has been acknowledged positively."He added: “As part of the process, the inspection has also highlighted some areas for improvement. "For example, whilst we are charging more suspects with criminal offences than in previous years, in the context of an overstretched criminal justice system, we must do better to achieve the right outcomes for victims, achieve that more quickly and more consistently."Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
