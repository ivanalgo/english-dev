A play which tells the story of a mother helping her son's attacker turn his life around will be moving to the West End.Punch, written by Nottinghamshire playwright James Graham, will transfer to London's Young Vic Theatre in March 2025.James Hodgkinson died in Nottingham in 2011 as a result of a single punch, while visiting to watch a cricket match in Nottingham.Jacob Dunne was jailed for his manslaughter and later met with Mr Hodgkinson's parents, who accepted his actions had been "a stupid mistake".
Mr Dunne went on to study criminology at university and has since campaigned against violence alongside his victim's mother, Joan Scourfield.The play was written by Mr Graham, who is originally from Mansfield, and was based on Mr Dunne's autobiography Right from Wrong.Mr Graham said: “This play and the incredible story it tells could not mean more to me."It feels like one of the most moving and urgent real-life dramas I’ve had the honour of translating to the stage. "I’ve never not watched without ugly crying and can’t wait to share it with a wider audience.”Punch is set to run in London from 1 March to 12 April, with original cast members Alec Boaden, Julie Hesmondhalgh, Tony Hirst, Shalisha James-Davis, Emma Pallant and David Shields all reprising their roles.Director Adam Penford said he was "thrilled" at the prospect of taking the play to the Young Vic.He added: "Punch had a profound impact in Nottingham because the story is so moving, and asks important questions about what it means to be human and what kind of society we want to live in."Our audience and supporters really got behind the production."Punch ran at the Nottingham Playhouse for three weeks in May.Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
