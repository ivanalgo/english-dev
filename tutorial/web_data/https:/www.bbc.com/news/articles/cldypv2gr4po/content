Eighties rock band James will kick off a series of concerts at Ludlow Castle on Thursday evening.The four open-air concerts are expected to draw 20,000 people to the castle's grounds. James are the first to get the gigs started, followed by Elbow on Friday. Madness play on Saturday, with Anne-Marie finishing the series on Sunday."What a beautiful setting. I've never been to Ludlow Castle before, I'm very much looking forward to it," said James bassist Jim Glennie.
The concerts are organised by Futuresound events, a company run by local lad, Colin Oliver, who grew up in the town.It is the second year the series has been held within the castle walls, after Rag'n'Bone Man, Kaiser Chiefs, Nile Rogers and Chic, and Bastille proved a hit in 2023.James, best-known for tracks like Sit Down and She's a Star, has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in recent years, which Mr Glennie said had been "bonkers"."I think it's all tied in with the 40th anniversary, it just seemed to stir up a lot of interesting attention," he told BBC Radio Shropshire.As for the gig, Mr Glennie said James promises a good time."You need to leave people going away with a sore throat because they've been singing too loud, and they're hot and sweaty and knackered."That's what we're aiming for. That's the goal of a James gig."I'll be there [Ludlow] during the day, enjoying the festival, because Iâ€™m going up the night before."
This will not be the end of Live at Ludlow Castle, as Futuresound announced it had signed a five-year deal to continue the events.Earlier this year, the company also received permission from Shropshire Council to stage up to eight days of live music there.
