A town has been transformed into a giant game to help people be physically active.Cinderford is hosting Beat the Street, and 926 people had already covered nearly 2,500 miles (4,025km) around the town so far, organisers said.Players walk, cycle or wheel between 36 "Beat Boxes" - sensors which are spaced half-a-mile (805m) apart. The further players travel during the game, funded by Active Gloucestershire and a National Lottery grant from Sport England, the more points they score.
Sarah Haden, director of people and partnerships at Active Gloucestershire said: “We know that one of the best things people can do for their physical and mental health is to move more and to get out into green space where possible, and Beat the Street really helps people do just that in a fun and engaging way.“It’s free to take part in Beat the Street and it’s open to everyone regardless of age, ability or background. "It’s an inclusive game that encourages you to exercise from your front door and to clock up the miles within the game framework.”Beat the Street was created by GP Dr William Bird MBE, an expert in physical activity and the founder of Intelligent Health. It has had increased levels of physical activity amongst adults and children and helps families spend time in green spaces together, the programme said.Four out of five primary schoolchildren do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise of 60 minutes a day, according to Beat the Street.The game is due to run until 24 July.
