Proposals that would give terminally-ill residents the right to choose to end their lives could move further forward in the Isle of Man's parliament later.The Assisted Dying Bill 2023, a private member's bill put forward by Alex Allinson MHK, is scheduled for its third reading in the House of Keys.Under the proposed laws, those eligible would have to be over the age of 18, have lived on the island for at least five years, and have a life expectancy of up to 12 months.If passed by MHKs, the document will move to the Legislative Council, which acts as  a revising chamber within the Manx parliament, for further consideration.
The Speaker has agreed to several requests for additional sittings of the House of Keys prior to the summer recess to allow for the completion of the consideration of clauses as well as the tabling of the third reading.While politicians have agreed the specific measures within the bill, the proposed legislation will now be debated as a whole.
Amendments to the original bill included ensuring health care professionals supporting an assisted death would not be committing a criminal offence, and the  training of staff on how to discuss assisted dying options with terminally ill patients.MHKs  also agreed patients would have to self administer an approved substance to end their lives and strengthened the wording surrounding coercion.Politicians also supported an opt-in system and a conscientious objection option for health care professionals.However, a bid by Chief Minister Alfred Cannan to hold a referendum prior to the introduction of any law was narrowly rejected, as were several attempts to adjourn the proposals.If the bill passes its third reading, it will have to pass through all of its stages in the Legislative Council and be given Royal Assent before becoming law.
