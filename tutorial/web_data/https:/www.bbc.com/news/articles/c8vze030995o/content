A man has documented his journey to more than 200 inhabited islands, including all eight of the Channel Islands. As part of the challenge John Chatterton managed to secure a trip to Brecqhou, which is owned by the Barclay estate.Initially he was given permission to land for 10 minutes, but ended up staying longer. He said it was "a great privilege to see things that mere mortals never see". 
It took Mr Chatteron several years to complete the challenge, which included the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and the Isle of Man, and he's since written a book entitled Treasured Islands. He said he did not expect to get permission to go to the private islands off Guernsey. However both requests were granted and he spent a day on Jethou and about an hour on Brecqhou. 
Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay bought the Channel Island of Brecqhou in 1993, and later built a Â£60m gothic-style mansion.Mr Chatterton said: "Even though I was told I could only have 10 minutes there the estate manager was so warmly welcoming that we chatted away and drove away in a golf buggy across the Island for well over an hour." The author said he was "delighted" to have the opportunity, although he was restricted on what he can say about the trip and was unable to take photos. Talking the overall challenge, he said he had learnt a lot about island life"The islands are very unique, and they are very proud of their uniqueness," he said."I'm sure that's no different from the islanders of the Channel Islands as well."
