A bus company has proposed a closure of its depots in two separate towns.Bus company Arriva said a consultation was under way on plans to shut the Aylesbury and High Wycombe depots and reduce the existing services.The firm said "despite extensive efforts" the routes were not profitable.Another transport company, Carousel Buses, said they would step in to run additional services in Wycombe.
Services that run between High Wycombe and villages in Buckinghamshire, such as Penn, Bourne End and Downley, are at risk of operations ending.Routes that run between Aylesbury and Oxford or High Wycombe could also come to an end.Arriva explained that following a consultation period the earliest date closures could go ahead would be 27 July.The firm said it hoped to avoid redundancies by re-deploying staff to other locations in the UK.
The Conservative MP for Aylesbury, Rob Butler, said he was "extremely concerned" by the proposal.He posted on X that the closure "would cause huge problems for local residents" and called for "an urgent meeting with senior management."Peter Martin, Buckinghamshire Councilâ€™s deputy cabinet member for transport, said the authority had no control over commercial bus operators and was not in a position to take over affected routes.He expressed disappointment the announcement came with "little warning" and added the council were "concerned about the negative impact this could have for passengers".He added: "We are aware that another bus operator, Carousel Buses, have indicated their intention to take over the vast majority of affected routes which is welcomed. "
Luke Marion, managing director of Carousel Buses, said users of the affected services "need not be concerned".The bus company, which is a subsidiary of the Go Ahead Group, already operates 50 buses in High Wycombe and Buckinghamshire.It said it would provide new services on several of the threatened Arriva routes from the date of closure.A statement from the company said it would "ensure that Wycombe and the surrounding area will be covered by a very similar level of bus services to today - albeit with different coloured buses running the routes".
