Children in parts of Kent will get free bus travel throughout the school summer holiday thanks to a new government scheme.Up to three passengers under 18 can travel for free with a fare-paying adult or concessionary bus pass holder within Medway Council’s boundaries.The scheme, which will operate until 20:00 BST each day between 20 July-1 September, is designed to encourage more people to “get out and have fun around Medway”.Councillor Simon Curry said: “It’s good news for businesses and leisure destinations over the summer holidays, and also for the environment.”
For the duration of the offer there will also be a new bus service operating hourly, seven days a week, stopping at main attractions throughout the towns. The service is included in the free child travel scheme, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.Mr Curry said: “There are so many great destinations here.“Being able to get to them for free makes a day out easier and even more enjoyable.”The councillor said that encouraging people to use public transport is “another step” toward achieving Medway’s target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.“Encouraging people to use public transport means we’re helping to cut down on carbon emissions," he said.
