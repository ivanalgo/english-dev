A homeless centre in west Belfast will consider leaving the area if it cannot gain the support of the local community, the charity's chairperson has said.Jude Whyte from the Welcome Organisation was speaking after the building was badly damaged when a suspected stolen car was rammed into the shutters of its building and set alight earlier this week. Threatening graffiti then appeared against workmen who plan to carry out repairs on the charity.“We've had 50 years of mayhem, we’re finally getting back to a bit of stability and we now have threat against working men and working women going about their business," he told BBC News NI.
“It’s a pretty dark day for those of us who work in this area of homelessness and addiction."If the car had of been driven into the building during working hours, Mr Whyte said it could have caused fatalities.
The Welcome Organisation is a Belfast-based charity which provides services for those experiencing homelessness and has been operating in the Townsend Street site for about 12 years.But Mr Whyte said the local community will receive flyers through their letterboxes in the coming days, inviting them to meet with the organisation to discuss the issues of anti-social behaviour and the future of the site.“You’re going to tell me honestly and openly if you can tolerate our organisation being in your community," he said.
“If we can’t find agreement, we’re going to have to look somewhere else.“I know this community, this resilient, proud community will work with us, but at the end of the day they will be calling the shots, we will not be an uninvited guest.”Mr Whyte said he was also extending an open invitation to those behind the attacks and threats.However, he said those behind the threatening graffiti should "get a bucket of paint and wipe it off the wall and hang your head in shame".
Local residents have been vocal in their concerns around anti-social behaviour in the area as a result of the service users at the centre.Lisa Duffy said it affects their daily lives, with residents often seeing people brawling in the street, injecting drugs or engaging in sexual acts.“We’re seeing things no one should see never mind young children," she said.“Tablets lying about, my children have brought me empty bags in with dust at the bottom asking what they are.“As much as we have empathy and sympathy for these service users and for their families, we need to speak up for ours. We need to feel safe in our community."
Ms Duffy said that she does not condone both the violence the Welcome Centre has faced and the graffiti.“I don’t want anyone hurt and that is the general consensus of this community," she said."None of us do."Meetings with residents and the Welcome Organisation are set to take place next week.In a statement, Belfast City Council said it "recognised" the concerns of residents and businesses over anti-social behaviour. The council added that it is committed to supporting ongoing work with the PSNI and relevant departments in "finding solutions to address this complex issue and help those who are vulnerable".
