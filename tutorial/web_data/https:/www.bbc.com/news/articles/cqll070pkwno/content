A would-be ferry operator has announced plans to build a new port and run all-electric ships powered by renewable sources.Wight Gateway Ltd (WGL) said it would build three new ships to operate between Ryde, the Isle of Wight, and Portsmouth, Hampshire.Director Danny Fisher said the firm's land, west of Ryde, was the intended site of a new port.He said the company already had an agreement with Portsmouth Port on a mainland berth.
Mr Fisher, a former army colonel and ex-chairman of Isle of Wight NHS Trust, said the firm was hoping to fast-track planning permission by winning National Significant Infrastructure Project status from the government.He said: "We can't do anything until we get planning permission for the port [at Ryde]."The challenge will be the Environment Agency and others interested in marine life."The coastline west of Ryde is protected from development, as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Ramsar wetland and Special Protection Area.Mr Fisher said the firm understood the challenges, adding: "All this has been done in a 10-year study."He said the ships, which would be able to carry cars and vans but not lorries, would be supplied by renewable power from both sides of the Solent.Previously, ferry firms Red Funnel and Wightlink have said the National Grid cannot currently supply enough power to run electric ferries across the Solent.However, Mr Fisher said the firm "had put a huge amount of effort" into research and was satisfied it could be achieved.He declined to comment on the company's finances.Isle of Wight Council leader Phil Jordan said: "I am incredibly supportive of this fantastic new initiative."This is a much-needed project that will help us as an Island community to reinvigorate businesses, tourism, connectivity, NHS and much more."
Isle of Wight MP Bob Seely said he was in discussions with Nick Wakefield, one of WGL's directors and a former banker.In March, the MP urged the government to support Mr Wakefield's proposals "because it would help to break the duopoly of Red Funnel and Wightlink" and reduce fares.Portsmouth City Council confirmed it had been approached about a ferry berth.In a statement, it said: “We... have agreed draft terms so discussions can continue further.”Red Funnel said passenger demand, on its routes between Southampton and Cowes/East Cowes, had fallen by about a third since the Covid pandemic.Wightlink and Hovertravel already operate services between Portsmouth and Ryde.Another firm, Fluid Taxi, is planning to run foot passenger ferries between Lymington Town Quay and Yarmouth from July.In 2015, Scoot Ferries began to operate two new routes across the Solent but the firm collapsed within months.
