Flowers have been left on a town's benches to "cheer up" people feeling lonely.Members of the Nateby and Wharton Women's Institute (WI) created about 30 bunches and left them around Kirkby Stephen in Cumbria earlier this month.One member of the public said the flowers "made [her] day" after she had a stressful week and was missing her mum.Anne Cradock, who was one of the organisers, said people were "glad they've come to live here because it's such a wonderful, supportive community".
Members of the WI created bunches using flowers and herbs from their own gardens.The project was also sponsored by local shop Gregsons Spar, who supplied additional flowers.They also placed a handcrafted heart in each bouquet so people had something to keep when the flowers died.
The bouquets were placed on 11 July, to coincide with World Loneliness Week.Mrs Cradock, 80, who lives in Kirkby Stephen and is one of the WI activity coordinators, said: "We let the community know so that, if they know someone that is living on their own or is sad or grieving, they can collect the flowers."Some bouquets included herbs, like mint, to increase the longevity of the bouquet."One lady did root her mint and it's growing in her garden," she said.Lucy Baker, from Kirkby Stephen, shared a message of appreciation for the efforts on social media.She posted: "After a stressful week, which included missing my mum, I found this bunch and they made my day. Thank you."Mrs Cradock responded: "That's what it's about, really."
Mrs Cradock said she had "always" been involved with the WI.She said: "When I was seven years old, which is a very long time ago, my mum was a WI president and my auntie was a first secretary."It was always one evening a month when I wasn't a mum or a teacher. "I was just me, doing things for me, and that's what WI is."She thinks people especially appreciated the flowers after Covid-19 lockdowns."Covid restored community spirit," Mrs Cradock said. "If you've seen any feedback from the people, they've said they're glad they've come to live here because it's such a wonderful, supportive community, and it is."
