A peacock is recovering after it fell from the roof of a two-storey building.The bird landed in a garden in an empty property in Shotton Colliery, County Durham, and initially was not moving. RSPCA inspector Christine Nisbet said by the time she arrived he had revived and was able to "give us a good run around".It is thought the bird fell after being "spooked" and it is not known where he came from.
“Given he had fallen from two storeys, he was still very mobile but we managed to catch him eventually," Ms Nisbet added.  “We took him to a vet and he had a scrape on his foot, but no further injuries so he was very lucky and it was important to get him checked over."
Peacocks are native to India and are thought to have been introduced to the UK in the 14th Century by aristocrat Sir John de Foxley.They are usually kept as ornamental birds in private gardens or estates, and have a loud raucous shriek most commonly heard during the breeding season from April to September. The peacock is recovering at a specialist animal rescue centre following the fall on 6 May. "We don't know where he came from, but no-one has come forward to claim him as a pet," Ms Nisbet added.
