Striking images have been captured of a huge field of poppies stretching almost as far as the eye can see.The field has been rewilded by the landowner in Great Massingham, Norfolk.The soil was ploughed and harrowed before being left for nature to run its course, with the result being a huge sea of red poppies.The common poppy - Papaver rhoeas - was once considered a weed of cornfields, but is now in decline due to intensive agricultural practices.
