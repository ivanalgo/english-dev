A terminal cancer patient was granted his wish of seeing comedian Peter Kay on tour just two months before he died.Paul Taylor, 51, from Holywell in Flintshire died on 6 April, eight years after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.His wife Emma bought tickets for the February show in Manchester but assumed they would not be able to go after Paul suffered a stroke in December and became bed-bound.But Paul remained optimistic.
She called Paul an "absolute character", and remembered him saying that he had "brought Peter Kay to north Wales" when they first moved in together and he arrived from south Wales with a collection of the comedian's stand-up DVDs.  "He'd quote him all the time," she said.Even after his stroke, Emma said her husband "just kept saying, 'I'll go [to the show in February]'". "He always defied expectations and was very, very stubborn which is partly why he lasted so long," she added.
Arrangements for father-of-one Paul and his family to attend were made by the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board hospice at home team and 'Wish', a scheme run by the Welsh Ambulance Service (WAS) volunteers who give end-of-life patients meaningful experiences."I was so happy that Paul got his wish and was able to spend an evening out with his family," said support worker Emma Williams."It was an absolute pleasure to be involved in organising this to make it happen, and I was happy to be able to share the excitement of it by going to help get him ready beforehand."[Wish] does an amazing job for palliative patients who are no longer able to get out and I'm sure Emma will never forget this special memory."WAS care assistant Leah Reading said: "Once we got into the arena, what they and Peter Kay had provided for the family to make it extra special was beyond incredible."
Emma said the comic even paid their bar bill. She said after spending six months at home in bed, Paul "wanted to get out of the four walls so he would have gone anywhere, but this was extra special".Paramedic Cara Lyons said: "Considering what Paul and his family were facing, they were in such great spirits and made us laugh the whole trip, especially when Paul demanded we stop on our way back for pizza, which we happily did."
"I was sad to hear of Paul's passing, but extremely grateful that I was able to be a part of the experience."On the night we arrived early before any crowds and the [AO arena staff] surprised us with a private suite with flowers, merchandise and even a waitress," she added.Emma said it was "quite shocking" that a lot of people in the NHS were not aware of  the Wish service offered by WAS and how it can do "life-changing things".
