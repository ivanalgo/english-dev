Trees on the shore of a lake have been cut down in what has been described as an "act of unspeakable vandalism".The felling of a section of trees next to Windermere in the Lake District has left people shocked and angry, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.Both the Lake District National Park Authority (LDNPA) and the Forestry Commission said they were investigating.The LDNPA said "ground disturbance" had occurred since the trees were felled.
"We are investigating whether this is in breach of planning control, separate of the tree felling which the planning system does not control in this case and which is being looked into by other bodies,‚Äù a LDNPA spokesperson said.The LDNPA added that tree felling on the land was regulated by the Forestry Commission, which said it had carried out a site inspection.
It is an offence in the UK to fell certain trees without a licence or relevant permission, which is punishable by an unlimited fine.Whether or not a conviction has been secured, the commission can serve a notice on the individual responsible for the land requiring them to replace the trees with new stock.One resident, who did not want to be named, said: "The felling of the trees strikes us, and indeed thousands of visitors to the Lake District who pass that section of the shoreline several times a day, as an act of unspeakable ignorant vandalism."There is also concern the trees' removal means a loss of habitat for wildlife in the area.The LDNPA said it would take action "where and when necessary".
