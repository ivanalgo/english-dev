A 24-hour dog care centre can stay open after winning retrospective planning approval following a five-year battle.Cobham-based Duncan’s Doggy Daycare faced opposition from Elmbridge Borough Council officers due to its its green belt location.Despite the recommendation for refusal, the family-run business, in Pointers Road, was granted planning permission in a unanimous council vote on Wednesday.More than 90 letters of support were sent to the council in support of the “asset to the community”. 
There were cheers from the public gallery as the decision was confirmed after almost five years of applications, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.In a statement to the council, owner Duncan MacBryde said planning approval was “critical”. He said his family’s “entire livelihoods are hinged on this planning decision” as they would be left without a home or income.
The centre, which has operated at the site since 2012, is licensed to cater for up to 150 dogs a day and has 20 staff.The application was the company’s third attempt for retrospective planning approval.No objections were received from the public, Surrey Wildlife Trust or Natural England.Mr MacBryde's representative, Hugh Sowerby, told the meeting the company had  “done everything possible whilst maintaining a viable business” since the original 2019 application.This included halving the size of the site, taking away two exercise pens, removing five unlawful buildings, removing all dog paraphernalia, and reprofiling and replanting part of the site.
