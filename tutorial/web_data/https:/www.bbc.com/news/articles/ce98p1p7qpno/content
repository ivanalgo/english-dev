A leak has been blamed for continued low levels of water at a 1930s seaside boating lake.Conservative councillor Peter Grogan said members of the Redcar Model Boat Club had been unable to use the lake in Newcomen Terrace, Coatham.Council leader Alec Brown said the local authority had spent £7,000 last year on a replacement pump, with levelling up funds intended to be used for more repairs.Coatham is already the focus of £3.75m regeneration plans largely funded by the Tees Valley Combined Authority, which are to see a coastal activity hub and hotel being added.
Members of the boat club attended a recent council meeting in which Mr Grogan raised the matter.He asked: "What avenues have you [the council] explored and why hasn’t the lake got any water?"Mr Brown said the issue was "ongoing" because the lake was "so old"."I completely feel your frustration," he said."It has been filled previously, but somewhere there is a leak and it is about finding out where that leak is."Mr Grogan had pressed council chiefs in the autumn over potential investment in the lake and future plans, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.He was told at the time options were being looked at, although no earmarked money was available to the Labour-led local authority from its budget.
