Staff at two Kirklees Council customer service centres are to vote on whether or not to take strike action. In February, plans to shut the customer support facilities in Huddersfield and Dewsbury were announced in a bid to save £34.5m.Trade union Unison said more than 40 jobs were being put at risk and claimed vulnerable and elderly residents would be hit the hardest.Kirklees Council said it wanted to "integrate" customer service centres and libraries, with support being provided online, or in person by library staff.
According to Unison, the centres offer support to the community with issues such as housing benefit and council tax. The union said a petition opposing the cuts had received almost 3,000 signatures.Unison Kirklees branch secretary Mick Donoghue believes council leaders must "listen to the strength of feeling" and "rethink these plans".He said: “Thousands of people have signed a petition against closing the centres, that figure is likely to grow.“It’s time to look at other options for saving money.”
Speaking in February, then deputy council leader Paul Davies said the closure plans were set against "a world of challenging local government finances".A council spokesperson said that following the pandemic "we have seen a continued change in the way that people are choosing to access services".They said the council wanted to make it "easier for people" to access advice and information online."The new offer will provide access to support via online or over the telephone support from 10 of our library locations."The spokesperson added: "The council is going through the necessary HR processes in consultation with unions and affected staff with the intention of minimising the impact on employees where possible by managing vacant posts and supporting staff to move into other roles within the council.  "We are pleased to report that many affected staff have already found alternative roles in the council."
