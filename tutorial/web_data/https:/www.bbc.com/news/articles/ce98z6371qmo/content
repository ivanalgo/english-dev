Care home residents were left unable to have a bath or shower for weeks due to renovation works, a report discovered.Inspectors found Oaklands had a "dirty" kitchen littered with debris and out-of-date food.The facility, in Brightlingsea, Essex, was rated "inadequate" and urged to make "immediate and widespread improvements" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).Primos Care Limited, which took over the home in October, has been contacted for comment.
Oaklands, on Church Road, provided care to 13 elderly people when it was inspected across February and March."We found a home that wasn't providing safe or effective care, largely due to poor management," said Hazel Roberts, of the CQC.
The report, published on Friday, said renovation works taking place to improve the site were creating a "chaotic" environment."I really like a bath, not had a shower or bath for weeks due to the works in the bathrooms," one resident told inspectors."I have to have bed washes. No choice about this."A staff member said it would be "great for people when it's all finished", but admitted: "It is a bit difficult at the moment."In the "unclean" kitchen, vegetables were not being stored correctly and there was evidence of cross-contamination in the fridge, the report said.The hand-washing facilities could also not be accessed due to "overcrowded worktop and floor space".The report added that vocal residents in the home were given more attention, while those with dementia were "left sleeping and unoccupied".However, it was noted the care provider was "committed to driving improvement" and staff were respectful."We have told the provider they need to make immediate and widespread improvements," Ms Roberts said. "We've put the home in special measures to keep people safe while these improvements are being made."
