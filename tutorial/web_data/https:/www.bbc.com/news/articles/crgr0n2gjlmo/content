A visitor centre celebrating the life and legacy of the ‘father of the modern circus’ is preparing to open.The Philip Astley Centre in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, will host workshops in circus skills and performance from 9 March.The town centre venue pays homage to historic figure Philip Astley, who was born in Newcastle in 1742.Widely believed to be the original ringmaster, he is credited with creating the first 42ft diameter circus ring, which is replicated around the world to this day. 
The centre has been spearheaded by performer Andrew Van Buren who hopes it will help to promote Mr Astley’s legacy.He told BBC Radio Stoke: “He is an absolute legend of Newcastle and when you think of his legacy – it’s gone worldwide.” 
As well as being known as the father of the modern circus, Mr Astley was considered a hero during the Seven Years War, during which he helped rescue the Duke of Brunswick from behind enemy lines. The centre has been created in a previously empty and derelict property on Merrial Street. As well as hosting circus performance workshops, which include activities like plate-spinning, the centre will also host classes, talks, lectures, film showings and close performance.
Mr Van Buren also hopes it will help to increase footfall for local businesses in the town centre.“Not only are we doing it to promote his [Mr Astley’s] legacy but also it will bring a bit of life and vibrancy to the town,” he said.It was transformed by Philip Astley Projects CIC, which worked alongside Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council with money from the government's levelling-up fund.
