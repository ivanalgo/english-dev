Island officials will consider closing the lower half of Victoria Street in Alderney on Saturday mornings.The proposal comes from the feedback of a traffic management survey conducted in April.Alderney’s General Services Committee [ GSC] said closing the road could create a better environment for residents and visitors.The GSC has now tasked a Traffic Working Group to provide a full report that includes further input from other stakeholders. 
GSC Chair Lin Maurice said the survey was intended to help understand traffic issues and the number of vehicles per household, in order to understand where the most congested areas are.“We received a small number of responses suggesting the pedestrianisation of Victoria Street, together with a separate proposal from the Chamber of Commerce," she said. 
The proposal would pedestrianise lower Victoria Street at certain times when the area is most busy with shoppers. The biggest concerns from the 267 responses to the survey were the increase in larger vehicles and the issue of abandoned vehicles.The survey also found that a number of people who own more than one car park their vehicles both on driveways and public roads, contributing to congestion in St Anne’s residential streets.
