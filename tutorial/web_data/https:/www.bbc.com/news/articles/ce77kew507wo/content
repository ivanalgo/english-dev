The brother of a victim of the contaminated blood scandal said he was not certain he would get compensation because he was not living with him at the time of his death.  Rich Newton, from Barnard Castle, in County Durham, lost his brother Mark, who had haemophilia, in 1989 after he was infected with contaminated blood products. In May the government announced the Infected Blood Compensation Scheme, but Mr Newton does not believe he is eligible for a payout.The Cabinet Office has been approached for comment.
Mr Newton's brother was one of 30,000 people infected from 1970 to 1991 by contaminated blood products and transfusions. "We weren't told anything about how he became HIV positive, there was no support for him, there was no apology from doctors there was nothing, they just swept it under the carpet," he said.Last month the government announced the scheme to compensate those affected following the publication of a public inquiry's report into the scandal. 
However, Mr Newton said that after reading the initial proposals for the scheme, he feared he would not be eligible."You had to be living with the person when they were infected and then continue living with them for a further two years," he said. "How is that relevant?"It's incredible to think that there's no recognition for the hurt and the torment."The impact on my life isn't being recognised."Mr Newton also said the government had not given victims "any dates or deadlines" for payments."So we could still be waiting potentially years for compensation," he added.
