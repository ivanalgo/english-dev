An 18-year-old is circumnavigating the entire coastline of Britain in an attempt to break a world record. Harry Besley, from Taunton, will depart on his journey mid-July in a rigid inflatable boat (RIB) powered solely by electricity, a challenge no one has attempted before.He is hoping the trip will showcase new technology and help to raise awareness of how power boat users can do their bit to reduce carbon emissions."That record has never been set yet before so we'll be the first, and the fastest," he said.
According to Round Britain eRIB, the secret to covering longer distances in electric boats is a slower speed, so they will be taking things steady and using an escort vessel to keep them safe.They will also be stopping at more than 40 points along the way to charge the boat's engine, and promoting the new technology in marinas, harbours, tourist hotspots and remote coastal villages."This is really to raise awareness of the possibility of electric boats," said Mr Besley."It hasn't been talked about much, electric and sustainable boating. I just wanted to do something to make people aware of the alternatives."It's not just the petrol emissions which are damaging, there's the noise pollution that affects the natural habitats, and air pollution. "The electric boat, because it's silent, doesn't cause noise, air or water pollution, so there's many benefits."
Mr Besley says he has been "on the water since [he] could walk", having grown up sailing, instructing, and driving dinghies before later moving over to powerboats."Although I am only young, I do have lots of experience and qualifications," he said."The excitement is building as we get closer to the start, and I'm really looking forward to experiencing the whole British coastline as we go round."Starting at Lyme Regis in Dorset, their route will take them south west to Dartmouth and Plymouth, before catching their breath at Newlyn Harbour to await the right conditions to tackle Lands End.If weather permits, they will head across the tidal Bristol Channel around the Pembrokeshire coast, before setting their sights on a well earned rest in Holyhead.The team will then complete the final leg of their journey across the Irish Seaâ€‹.
