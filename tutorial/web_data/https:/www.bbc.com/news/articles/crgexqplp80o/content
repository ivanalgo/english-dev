A Coastguard station officer from East Yorkshire is to receive a British Citizen Award (BCA).Jonathan Cliff, from Hornsea has been a volunteer in the seaside town for 45 years having started as a teenager in 1979.Mr Cliff will be recognised during a ceremony at the Palace of Westminster, where he will be presented with the BCA Medal of Honour for Services to the Community.He said he was "very humbled" to have been nominated for the honour.
"I'm looking forward to it," he said."Actually, that initial trepidation has turned into excitement, I think now."Mr Cliff will receive his award in a ceremony at the Palace of Westminster in London next week.He will be accompanied by Coastguard colleague Ben Colombari, who nominated him for the award."Doing more than 45 years service as a volunteer is definitely worthy of recognition," Mr Colombari said.He added: "Jonathan has supported me in my time in the Coast Guard, as station officer, somebody I really aspired to be. "It's just when you see somebody that's done that length of service and the knowledge and the skills that he brings to the team and and what we offer to the wider community."You just kind of feel well, this is why I still want to continue doing it."
Mr Cliff, who is believed to be the UK's longest serving Coastguard volunteer, said he was proud to be part of a team who combined rescuing people alongside their day jobs.He recalled being called out last year as he sat down to eat his Christmas lunch.Other rescues included saving an elderly dog walker who had fallen into a slurry pit."So what turned out to be a voluntary role for a couple years when I was 16 has turned into a 45 year, I’d say passion, because it is a passion of mine, " Mr Cliff said."I love it, fantastic team here."Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
