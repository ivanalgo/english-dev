A £32m road bridge built just two years ago has been partially closed following the appearance of cracks. The King's Dyke bridge - connecting Peterborough and Whittlesey - was created  to overcome delays caused by a level crossing. But it was expected to be closed for at least a week after cracks were spotted in the westbound carriageway. Cambridgeshire County Council said temporary traffic lights had been put in place while tests, involving digging into the road, were carried out. 
One lane has been temporarily closed using the two-way traffic lights, as a precaution,The council said other work would be carried out at the same time, such as clearing drains and testing safety barriers.“We’d like to thank people for their patience during this time and further information will be provided in due course, but it is expected one lane will be closed for at least a week," the authority said.The bridge, known as the Ralph Butcher Causeway, was named in honour of a former Fenland district councillor who campaigned for it to be built back in the 1970s. It was officially opened in July 2022.
