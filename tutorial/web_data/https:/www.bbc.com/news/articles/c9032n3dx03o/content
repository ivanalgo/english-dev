A new 3G football pitch named after Lioness Lauren Hemp has been officially opened near Norwich.Manchester City and England forward Hemp, 23, grew up in North Walsham in Norfolk and used to play for the town's women's team.She returned to her roots on Friday to officially open the new Lauren Hemp Community 3G Pitch at The Nest, a 22-acre (nine hectares) sports site boasting several other pitches and facilities in Horsford.Hemp said it felt "surreal and very special" to have it named in her honour. 
Hemp started out with the North Walsham boys' team, and moved to Norwich City's Centre of Excellence, rejoining her hometown club when the Canaries' centre closed.At 16, she left home to join Bristol City, and signed for Manchester City in 2017.The Nest has two floodlit 3G football pitches, seven grass pitches, multi-use indoor spaces, an outdoor adventure playground and residential capacity for more than 70 people.Opening the new pitch, Hemp said: "It's unbelievable to be here and see so many kids enjoying themselves on this pitch."She said staff at the facility had been a "massive part of my journey - giving me the opportunity to succeed and thrive"."I wish I was able to have a pitch like this when I was growing up, but the girls are very lucky to be able to have this."
Some of those enjoying playing on their new pitch were members of the academy development programme for the under-10s.Phoebe said it was "amazing" seeing Kemp."She's a really good player and I think this is going to help us develop."Matilda added: "It's been really good, and I'm really happy to see her because she's like my legend."
Thirty pitches like this are planned - all to be named after Lionesses.Robert Sullivan, chief executive of the Football Foundation, said: "The Nest and the Lauren Hemp pitch is the very epitome of everything the foundation and its partners... are trying to achieve."
Hemp said: "It's so important that we keep trying to be role models and that we keep succeeding in football."Women's football's come a long way - but there's still so far to go - and I believe we can do that."She is currently enjoying a bit of a holiday back in her home town, and said she had been to the seaside and was enjoying the recent warm weather."I'm really excited to just enjoy being a little kid again back in North Walsham where I grew up," she added.
