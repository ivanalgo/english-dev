Talks are continuing in an effort to resolve a pay dispute at the Dounreay nuclear power site.The GMB, Prospect and Unite unions suspended strikes planned for Wednesday and Thursday to allow its members to consider a new offer.The unions had previously rejected a 4.5% offer backdated to April 2023.Prospect said if the latest offer was rejected action would commence on 15 May with a single strike day followed by work to rule.
The dispute involves most of the site's 1,200 staff.Dounreay on the north Caithness coast near Thurso dates to the 1950s and was the site of Scotland's first operational nuclear reactor - the Dounreay Materials Test Reactor - which achieved criticality in 1958.The complex is now being decommissioned.
