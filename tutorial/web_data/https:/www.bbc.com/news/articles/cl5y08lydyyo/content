Guernsey's Torteval Scarecrow Festival raised about £16,000 for local charities despite a rainy start to the two-day event, organisers have said.  Held annually, the family event attracts thousands of people with its scarecrow trail around the parish, created by residents. Organisers said on 20 July, the first day of the festival, some people were put off by the heavy rain.Event co-organiser, Sue Brooks, said despite the weather the fundraising event was "a remarkable effort all round".
"Although we are awaiting the final figures we hope to have made a profit in the region of £16,000 which will be distributed to various Guernsey charities," she said. In addition, Parkinson’s Guernsey and the RNLI Guernsey Branch collected almost £5,000 from donations through car parking fees.
