Clothes worn by A-list stars Keira Knightley, James Norton and Carey Mulligan in some of their most successful films have gone on display in Yorkshire.The new exhibition of movie and TV costumes opened at Cannon Hall in Barnsley on Friday and runs until September.It features a gown that appears in Bridgerton spin-off series Queen Charlotte and an outfit worn by British actress Knightley in 2008 film The Duchess, which won an Academy Award for costume design.Costumes from the Classics includes a suit made for Yorkshire actor James Norton for his role in Little Women and linen worn by David Suchet when he played the detective Poirot.
The museum is part of the Cannon Hall estate, which belonged to the Spencer-Stanhope family before Barnsley Council acquired the stately home.All of the costumes that make up the exhibition are inspired by 18th Century owner John Spencer's love of literature, and were used in productions that were adapted from novels.
Cannon Hall education officer Alison Cooper said: "Many of the costumes have won Oscars, Baftas, Emmys, you name it - for the clothes themselves, not just the film."The 2019 adaptation of Little Women, in which Norton, who grew up in Malton, played tutor John Brooke, also won an Oscar for its wardrobe department.Displayed alongside his suit is a dress designed for Carey Mulligan in her role as Bathsheba in the 2015 version of Thomas Hardy's novel Far From the Madding Crowd.
The exhibition also brings together costumes from two productions of Agatha Christie's 1937 novel Death on the Nile.As well as Hercule Poirot's outfit from the 2004 TV series, there is a silk shirt made for Hollywood star Bette Davis in the 1978 film.
The costumes have been provided by CosProp, one of the worldâ€™s leading suppliers for the film, TV and theatre industries.They are "period correct" with authentic undergarments.The free event gives visitors the chance to try on costumes themselves and perform on a pop-up film set.
