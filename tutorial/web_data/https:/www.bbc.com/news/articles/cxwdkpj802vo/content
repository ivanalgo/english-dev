A rare "moon halo" was spotted in the night sky across north-east England and North Yorkshire on Boxing Day.The ring around the moon was seen on Tuesday evening after a similar halo was visible in other parts of the country last month.Lunar halos are caused by the refraction of moonlight through ice crystals in the upper atmosphereThe phenomenon was seen by residents in North Tyneside, Northumberland, North Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and Leicestershire.
Mairi Bell saw the halo at Cullercoats beach.She said: "I've never seen this halo effect before. "It was beautiful and filled the sky above the beach."
The halo was caused by ice crystals which are formed in clouds high up in the atmosphere which then refract the light from the moon.The ring produced is usually white but in rare situations it can take on a faint colouration due to the light's refraction, according to the Met Office.
In the past, the phenomenon was used as a form of weather forecasting as when the ice crystals travel lower, rain becomes more likely.In the summer months, the halo can be a sign of approaching storms.A similar effect can also form around the sun.
