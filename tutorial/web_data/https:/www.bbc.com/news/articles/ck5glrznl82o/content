Politicians have spoken out about the abuse they faced during the election campaign. A Green Party candidate in north-east England said she wanted to help amplify the voices of people with disabilities, but instead faced questions about her capability due to being a wheelchair user. Meanwhile, a Conservative councillor faced "horrendous" abuse that included having "Tory scum" shouted at her in the street. When new MPs were sworn into parliament last week, they were given panic alarms and advice on public safety alongside the usual maps of Westminster. 
Chloe-Louise Reilly stood for the Green Party in Tynemouth and said she experienced a wave of online abuse from people who believed she was not fit to be an MP because she was a wheelchair user. "There was a couple of points where I had a cry and I rang my mam and my Grandma and said I'm not sure I can do this", said Ms Reilly. "But they said you're wanting to make positive change and these people aren't."You need to not let people that aren't willing to work for positive change stop you from working for it."
Joanne Howey is a Conservative councillor representing Bishop Auckland on Durham County Council and contested the Easington seat in the general election. Ms Howey said she was scared to go to some places because of the abuse she faced,  saying people would shout "Tory scum" at her, among other things."It can be quite difficult and it did feel aggressive," she said.Ms Howey was concerned that her experience could put other women off getting into politics.She said: "It does make you think about whether you would want to do it again when people react in that way to you."We’re missing out on some really good people who could be councillors, who could be MPs – but they will just not put their name forward because of the abuse people get."
