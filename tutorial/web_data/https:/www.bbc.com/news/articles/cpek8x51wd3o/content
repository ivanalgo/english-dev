A collection of 1,600 vintage comics found during a house clearance has sold for more than double its estimated value.The comics, mostly Marvel and largely dating back to the 1960s, were discovered in the loft of a house in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands.Auctioneers in Lichfield, Staffordshire, anticipated they would sell for up to £5,000, but they went for £13,150, with every single issue sold.The comics had included the likes of Spider-Man, Captain America and The Hulk, and there were some "exciting scenes in the saleroom" as "the hammer came down again and again,” said auctioneer Richard Winterton.
A single lot made up of more than 1,500 comics, largely from the 1960s and 1970s, sold for £8,400.Some individual comics fetched three figure sums, including the first solo Silver Surfer comic, which sold at £320.Mr Winterton said it was a "fittingly fantastic result" for a collection which had "come to light in a loft" during a house clearance.
