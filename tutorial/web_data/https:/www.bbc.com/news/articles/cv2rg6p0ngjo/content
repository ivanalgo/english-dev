One of the most important sites for breeding shorebirds is due to host 10 days of activities to educate people on their impact on the site.Lindisfarne Nature Reserve is hosting rockpool rambles and shorebird talks, among other activities, in a bid to get people closer to nature as part of Natural England's Nature Reserves Week.Natural England said walkers and dog walkers "unwittingly" disturbing breeding and roosting birds and seals across the reserve resulted in some of the biggest negative impacts on the nature reserve.Christine Venus, from Natural England, said nature reserves had provided people with opportunities to enjoy and engage with natural heritage for decades.
"This is especially true of Lindisfarne which really is one of the North East’s jewels in nature’s crown," she added.Natural England said connecting people to nature was "vital" to preserve and enhance habitats.Although some areas are fenced off to protect breeding birds, the organisation said learning about wildlife at the site was the best way to enjoy the area safely.It added "recreational disturbance" had a "massive negative impact" on the wildlife - alongside climate change - with drones often mistaken for avian predators, for instance.Ms Venus, Natural England's deputy director for the North East, said: "We want everyone to join us this National Nature Reserves Week in appreciating and enjoying one of England’s most important places for nature."All events, which are set to take place from 20 to 31 May, are free and there is no need to book.
