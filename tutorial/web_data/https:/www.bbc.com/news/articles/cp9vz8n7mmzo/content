A five-year-old girl has received a bravery award after calling an ambulance when her mum fell ill.Paramedics said Lola, from Pode Hole, near Spalding, Lincolnshire, remained calm while faced with a distressing situation when her mum Kirsty rolled off the sofa and began to have a seizure.She called 999 using her mum's smart watch and explained to call handlers what had happened.East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said Lola had done "brilliantly".
The call was answered by emergency medical adviser Tim Higham-Jones, who nominated Lola for the award.“She was able to answer all the questions asked, confirming her mum was not awake and breathing noisily," he said.“It’s always important for us to get the right information so we can arrange the appropriate help, and Lola made this very easy to do.“At times during the call, Lola would be reassuring her mum that help was being arranged and it was on its way."She was just unbelievable actually, the way she was so calm with the situation," Mr Higham-Jones added.Lola was also praised for coaxing the family's dog into another room before the arrival of the ambulance crew during the incident on 5 April.
Speaking to the BBC after receiving her award, Lola said: "The ambulance man told me what to do."I had to move the stuff out of mummy's way and I needed to get her some water and put a pillow under her head."Praising her daughter's actions, Kirsty said: “I’m super proud of her."I'm amazed at just how much she did and how much she was listening," she said.“She has witnessed me have a seizure a few times prior to that day, but she would normally be able to get another grown-up to help," she added.
