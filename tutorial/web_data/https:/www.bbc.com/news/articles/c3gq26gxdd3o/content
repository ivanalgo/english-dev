Manx politicians have given their support to a proposed laws that would lead to making period products free for those who need them being drafted. Joney Faragher MHK asked for permission to introduce a private member's bill in the House of Keys on Tuesday.It follows a call by campaign group the Manx Menstrual Movement for the island to follow Scotland in making products free.The Douglas East MHK told politicians research in the UK had found that "one in four women" with lower incomes had missed at least one day from work due to being unable to afford period products.
Ms Faragher said there was a "toxic trio" of factors that fueled period poverty, namely a lack of education around periods, stigma or shame and the cost of products. She said: "Menstruation is just health, it is a normal part of life and products should be as available in public facilities as toilet roll."The bill would ensure periods could be managed "with dignity and without financial strain" to avoid some people are having to make the choice between spending money on period products and food, she said.Alongside seeking free period products, Ms Faragher said that better education was needed to help remove the stigma around periods. Health and Social Care Minister Lawrie Hooper said that while he was supportive of Ms Faragher having leave to introduce the bill, he raised concerns about the level of work being expected from the his department, The proposed legislation would be the fifth private member's bill that would directly affect his department, and "the priority work for the department will remain what is set out in the island plan", he added.Cabinet Office Minister Kate Lord-Brennan said, given that taxpayers would be funding the matter, she needed more information about the scheme before she could support it to ensure it reached those most in need.Several members also suggested that work could be done with the third sector to reach Ms Faragher aim without the need for primary legislation. The vote to grant leave to introduce the bill was backed by 20 of the 24 MHKs.
