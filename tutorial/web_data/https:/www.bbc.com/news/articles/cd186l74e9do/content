The organisers of a music festival have said they are "devastated" to cancel the 2024 edition of their event.Jess Glynne, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Paul Weller were among the musicians due to perform at PennFest in the village of Penn, Buckinghamshire, between 19 and 21 July.In a statement posted online, they said: "Challenging trading conditions coupled with significantly increasing costs in a very challenging economic climate has made it impossible to deliver the event to the standard our customers have become accustomed to."Ticketholders can request a refund, or tickets will roll over to the 2025 event.
Plans for next year's festival will be announced in the summer.The announcement follows many other festival cancellations and postponements, including Standon Calling in neighbouring Hertfordshire.The organisers of PennFest said: "For us it’s important to prioritise the wellbeing and the long-term sustainability of the festival, and by regrouping in this way we can deliver on our commitment to further high-quality experiences in the future."This is not a decision we have taken lightly, and the whole team is devastated by this after all their hard work over the past 12 years since the festival’s inception."
