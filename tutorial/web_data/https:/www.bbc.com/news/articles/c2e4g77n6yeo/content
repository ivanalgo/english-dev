Hundreds of people are expected to attend a running event in aid of a Jersey charity later.Festival of the Mile welcomes runners of all abilities to take on a series of mile-long running challenges for mental health charity Jersey Mind.One of the races involves a "beer mile" in which competitors have to drink an alcoholic or non-alcoholic pint before running.The event, now in its third year, has previously raised money for other local charities.
Event co-founder Louise Bailey said Jersey Mind was chosen this year due to the links between "being active and good mental health". Mrs Bailey said the festival was still a new concept but she hoped to welcome plenty of people."We wanted to make it as family-friendly as possible this year," she said. "We've included events for young people between six and 15 and families can compete together."I had a seven-year-old call me earlier in the week to make sure we had real medals."Other challenges included a mascot race and a junior mile.The registration for races at FB fields on St Clement's Inner Road open at 10:30 BST, with races due to begin at 11:15.The event is due to close at 17:00.
