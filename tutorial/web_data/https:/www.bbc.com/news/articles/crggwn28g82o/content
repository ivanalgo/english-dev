An abandoned Doberman puppy that was found cowering in bushes has found a  new home.The year-old dog, Dobby, was spotted by a runner on Morton Road, Stretton, on Wednesday 6 March.A "terrified" Dobby was then rescued to RSPCA's Chesterfield branch, where he received care.On his adoption, Steph McCawley, from the branch, said: "You wouldn’t believe he is the same dog."
“Dobby is such a lovely dog, and everyone has fallen in love with him. We knew he would be adopted quickly", said Ms McCawley.“The difference between how he was when he was first rescued to now is astounding."Dobby was in such a poor way when he arrived at the RPSCA Chesterfield branch, vets said it "wasn’t clear if he would make it".He was put on medication for his skin, and his tail had to be amputated.On Wednesday, Dobby went to his new forever home after being adopted by Josie and Scott Overton, who live in Chesterfield.“It goes to show that it is possible for animals who suffer from cruelty to neglect to have happy endings", said Ms McCawley.
