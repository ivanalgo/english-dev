A new film and TV building is due to be built at a university campus, despite more than 80 objections.Cambridge City Council has given Anglia Ruskin University permission to build the new facility, as well as make a number of upgrades and alterations to other buildings.The university leadership said the new film and TV complex reinforced its commitment to the arts and creative sector.Concerns about the redevelopment at the campus in East Road had been raised - with 87 objections lodged against the plans.
Among the concerns raised were the potential for increases in an "ongoing noise issue" they claimed they were dealing with, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.Planning officers at the council said the proposals put forward by the university had been looked at by the environmental health team.They said officers were satisfied that the noise generated by the plant equipment could be “successfully mitigated” through conditions being imposed on the planning permission.At a meeting of the council’s planning committee on Wednesday, James Rolfe, chief operating officer at Anglia Ruskin University, said he believed the proposals put forward would "enhance" and improve the appearance of the university campus.He said that while other universities were reducing or closing art and creative industry offerings, this project "reinforces" Anglian Ruskin’s support for the area.Councillor Katie Thornburrow said councillors were "really proud" to have the university in the city.When a decision on the application was put to a vote the committee agreed to approve the plans.
