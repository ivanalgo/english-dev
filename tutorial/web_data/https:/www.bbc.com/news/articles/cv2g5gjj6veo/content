A three-week surfacing programme to improve roads across the Isle of Man has begun.The summer’s micro asphalt surfacing scheme has been rolled out this week and is set to last until 11 August.The process, which includes a mixture of a polymer modified bitumen emulsion, small aggregate and cement, seals the surface to prolong the life of roads.Laid in two phases, traffic will be allowed on the surfaces during the period between the two coats, however reduced speeds will be needed due to loose chippings on the road.
The rollout follows the beginning of the Department of Infrastructure’s annual surface dressing programme on 9 July.Both projects are being carried out by contractors Kiely Brothers on behalf of the department.Roadside parking has also been also suspended during the road closure periods.A spokesman for the department said the process was a “speedy, efficient and economic method of preventative maintenance and carrying out minor re-profiling of carriageway surfaces”.
Full list of roads included in the programme are:Closure orders will only be implemented on each road as the works are carried out.The department has warned that the schedule may change due to operational constraints or poor weather.
