It is "only a matter of time" before someone is killed by traffic using a haulage yard in a South Yorkshire village, resident have said.The comments came at a Rotherham Council planning meeting which heard proposals for the site in Brinsworth.Steel fabricating business Burnhart had requested permission to place five storage containers, CCTV and fencing on the land off Grange Lane.Council planner Lisa Brooks said the site was already in use, attracting complaints, and had needed retrospective planning approval.
Ms Brooks added that there was a condition on the application for the site to be used as a haulage yard only.However, residents said the plans would mean increased pollution and traffic – and one warned that she feared a fatality.The resident said: “HGVs are entering into Grange Lane from around 04:00. You are awake from vibrations as the lorries brake on the road.“Some years ago, I witnessed a fatality opposite my house at the end of Grange Lane involving a HGV, something I never wish to witness again.”“It’s only a matter of time before there’s another fatality.”More than 30 objections were submitted to the council, as well as a petition with 70 signatures.One resident told the meeting, attended by the Local Democracy Reporting Service, that the area was "already gridlocked" and the situation would be worsened by the haulage yard.
Ms Brooks said that the impact on the nearby roads as a result of the application was "negligible".“Conditions restricting hours of operation and number of HGV movements will reduce any loss of amenity for local residents,” she added.However, another resident told the meeting that there had already been 28 incidents reported to the council regarding the site.“Council planning and enforcement teams no longer have any credibility amongst local residents,” they said.The plans were approved following a vote.
