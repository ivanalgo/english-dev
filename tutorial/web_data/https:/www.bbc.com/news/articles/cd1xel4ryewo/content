More than £600,000 worth of funding has been approved for a library's refurbishment, as well as improvement of a playground.Mid Suffolk District Council approved the funding on Monday from the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).Stowmarket Library will receive £538,662.24 for its extension and refurbishment, while Debenham recreation ground will see £74,000 to replace the play facilities.Andrew Stringer, Green Party cabinet member for heritage, planning and infrastructure at the council, said the project would benefit the local communities.
"We are sure the Mid Suffolk projects in Stowmarket and Debenham will make a positive difference to people living there and we look forward to seeing how they progress," he added.CIL payments are a legal requirement paid by developers of residential sites across the districts, and are earmarked for projects that help local infrastructure keep pace with developments.Stowmarket Library will see a side extension created with alterations of the interior building, including of the four meeting rooms and back office space.New toilet facilities and a new entrance will be built along with improvements to the foyer. Ollie Walters, ward member for St Peters, said he was "delighted to see Stowmarket Library benefitting from CIL investment"."We are lucky to still have a library, when so many other towns have had theirs cut, so extending our service is great news for the community and another good reason for residents to come into the town centre," he added.Debenham's recreation ground will see the play equipment replaced as, according to the council, the current provisions "no longer meet the needs of the community".Included in the plans will be the installation of inclusive and accessible play equipment, as well as outdoor fitness gym equipment. Teresa Davis, ward member for Debenham, said the plans for the recreation ground were "great news" for Debenham Parish Council."Both schools in the village played a part in advising the council and I think the new area is going to be well-used and bring a variety to all ages," she added.
