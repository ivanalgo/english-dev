A pier damaged by Storm Babet in 2023 will not reopen until next year, a council has confirmed.Roker Pier suffered "significant structural damage" during the October storm, Sunderland City Council said.It was closed to the public on safety grounds until the damage could be fixed.However, the council said the "amount of specialist repairs" and a need for "optimum weather and sea conditions" meant it was unlikely the work would be finished before early 2025.
The pier was one of three in Sunderland, along with Old North Pier and New South Pier, to be damaged during storms Babet and Ciarán.Strong winds and waves also battered a pier in South Shields so badly the dome of its lighthouse broke off and has still not been found.The council reallocated £1.8m to carry out the repairs on the three structures. The money had been earmarked for the council's Nobles Quay Reconstruction scheme.Work to repair Roker Pier alone is expected to cost £200,000.
