A swing meant for wheelchair users has been damaged, prompting the council to padlock it to deter "vandalism and misuse".North East Lincolnshire Council said the specialist disability play equipment at Weelsby Woods in Grimsby had been "locked off temporarily due to a spate of anti-social behaviour".Residents said on Facebook that they had seen able-bodied children misusing it. A council spokesperson said the swing would be repaired before being brought back into use and the authority was "waiting for costs from the supplier". 
It added that it was "determined" to reopen the equipment, as it wanted to ensure "everyone can enjoy our parks and open spaces".On Facebook, a mother with a disability said her daughter "loves to go on the swing with me, itâ€™s the only type we can use".She wrote: "I hope they find a solution soon as we love visiting the woods."
