Joe, who has gained a social media following for building stadia out of Lego, said it "cheered me up a lot".In a video message that Joe has reposted on his own social media feed, Chaplin said that he and all the lads at the club were sending "love and support". 
"It was a really nice video to receive, it really cheered me up," he said.Chaplin sent his "best wishes" and said "all the lads are sending all their love and support as well".He wished the teenager "all the best for your recovery" and hoped he "was on the mend".The young Town fan has amassed more than 13,000 followers on X (formerly known as Twitter) and another 9,000 on Instagram, where he shares videos of himself building stadiums out of Lego.He said: "I put out on my Twitter I couldn't build at the moment because of the injury and I think one of my followers might have picked it up and Conor Chaplin sent that really nice video. "I was really happy; it cheered me up a lot because I wasn't having the best of weeks. It really meant a lot to me.""He was right up there, but he's definitely now my favourite player." 
His dad, Phil Bryant said the message showed what a great club Ipswich was."What a top man Conor is; he didn't have to do that," he said."I've supported Ipswich since the early 80s and it shows you the club's got a real family feel to it and it does the right things. "It's a proper football club."
Having created a version of Portman Road in 2017 when he was much younger, Joe said he was hoping to add a new version of Portman Road to his Lego portfolio but it might take a bit longer with his injury.
