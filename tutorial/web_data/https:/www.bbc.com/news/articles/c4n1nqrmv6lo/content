Plans to build 120 low-carbon homes in a Surrey village have been submitted for public consultation.Half of the properties on the site in Bletchingley will be affordable to meet with local housing need, according to developer Obsidian Strategic.The plans include provision of over seven acres of public open space, which will be planted with new woodland, and a children's play area.Obsidian, which is undertaking a public consultation, said the proposed development - between Godstone Road and Rabies Heath Road - "can be accommodated within the existing capacity of the highway and public transport network".
