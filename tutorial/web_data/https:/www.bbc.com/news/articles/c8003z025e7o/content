An historic abbey built as a monastery more than 800 years ago has been listed on the market for Â£5.45m.Beeleigh Abbey, near Maldon in Essex, was opened in 1180 and has been owned by the Foyle family, owners of the bookshop chain Foyles, since 1943.Christopher Foyle had completed an award-winning restoration of the building and its gardens before his death in 2022.Maldon historian Stephen Nunn said it was an "anxious time" for those interested in the estate.
The abbey had been built as a monastery for the White Canons, but later suffered during the dissolution instigated by Henry VIII - which saw much of the building destroyed.It had been one of 34 Norbertine monasteries in England before it was seized in June 1536.In the years that followed, it was used as a farm house, pub and country residence before being privately owned by the Foyle family.
Mr Nunn said: "I'm sad that it is leaving the Foyle family and it is an anxious time."I hope it goes to the right buyer and I hope it continues to be a special feature of the area, as it has been for centuries."The grounds extend to 35 acres (14ha) and are a mix of gardens, woodland and wetland, according to the online listing.It detailed that William Foyle had "happened upon" the abbey in 1943 during a day of boating on the River Chelmer."Immediately captivated by the abbey and the setting, he made a private acquisition and enjoyed a spirited life at Beeleigh," the listing said.
