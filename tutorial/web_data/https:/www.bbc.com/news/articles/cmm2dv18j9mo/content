Plans for a £19m revamp of a sports centre will be considered by councillors on Monday.The overhaul is being proposed for Tides Leisure Centre in Deal.Dover District Council began planning the scheme in 2018, but it was held up by the Covid-19 pandemic.The authority said work could be completed by summer 2027.
New facilities would include a five-lane 25m pool, health and fitness stations, toning tables, multi activity and spin studios, and café area.The existing four-court sports hall and indoor tennis centre would be retained, but the wave and splash pools would be removed.The council said it hoped the upgrade would make the centre fit for purpose for the next 50 years.The special cabinet meeting to discuss the plans takes place at 18:00 BST on 29 July, with the report available here.
