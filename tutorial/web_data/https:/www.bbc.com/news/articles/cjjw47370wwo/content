A mural has been unveiled at the entrance to a primary school, designed by the  young pupils and wider community.The painted mural outside Bishops Cannings School, near Devizes in Wiltshire, depicts hand drawn designs from the children, who range from two to 11 years old.It was funded by the Aldhelm Mission Fund as part of the Salisbury Diocese, which supports missional initiatives and worshipping communities in parishes and schools.The inspiration for the quaint scene came from the surrounding village, with the school's bible verse interwoven through the pastures.
Headteacher at the school, Katherine Vardy, told BBC Radio Wiltshire she was "so grateful" to everyone who contributed, including school governors and trustees."It's absolutely beautiful, standing proud right as you enter our school," she said."It represents what we believe in, as a school and our community." The artist commissioned to bring the designs to life, Penny Chivers Stanley, said choosing which elements to include was a difficult process."The biggest challenge for me was when I received all the drawings from the children," she said."To get so many beautiful drawings and think 'how do I pull out aspects of these and put them into one scene?' It was hard."But it's really lovely to see it actually come to fruition, and see everyone feel this love for what a community has produced together." 
The mural can be spotted from afar as families and children make their way towards the school gates."It's so bright, so welcoming, so child friendly," Ms Chivers Stanley added."If you see something like that, it gives you an essence of what this school is all about." Gill DeBerry, who represented the Aldhelm Mission Fund at the unveiling, said it was "an honour" to help the school achieve their vision."It's a long time since we've funded a mural, so it was lovely to be able to do so," she said."Here is a mural making people think about love and Jesus as they get to the school, which is what it's all about."
