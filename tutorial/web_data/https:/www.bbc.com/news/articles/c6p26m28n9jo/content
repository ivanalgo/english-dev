A Devon project said it was tackling the "biodiversity crisis" with bigger wildflower meadows along the coast. South Devon National Landscape's Life on the Edge was awarded a £2.2m grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund for a five-year project which started in April 2024. It said the total project value for the five year delivery phase was £4,420,265, with additional funding which came through its partners including Buglife and the National Trust.Life on the Edge said it was "boosting the populations of 60 of the most threatened invertebrates and plant species, whilst benefitting the habitats of hundreds  of other invertebrates, birds, reptiles, bats and plants."
Volunteer and learning coordinator Nicky Bailey described the area as an important stronghold for some species. "South Devon is a national stronghold for some these species. "In its most simple sense, making better and bigger wildflower meadows on the coast," said Ms Bailey. "If the food is not right, or the weather is not right, or it's too windy or wet, or that habitat is not there in the small amount of time they have to feed and forage and mate and all the other things they squeeze into their short lives, then that is going to make it really tricky for them."
