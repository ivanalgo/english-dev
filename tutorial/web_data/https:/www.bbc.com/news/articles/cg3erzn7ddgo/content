A golfer has walked and swung his way around 26 miles of forest, carrying his clubs, to raise money for a children's cancer charity.Tom Morris, Captain of the New Forest Golf Club, started at Brokenhurst Manor Golf Club at dawn on Friday, going on to play a hole at Burley and Bramshaw, before finishing with a full round at his club in Lyndhurst at 18:00 BST.He took on the challenge to raise money for Abby's Heroes, which supports children, teenagers and young adults with cancer and their families.Mr Morris raised more than Â£600 for the charity and described it as "by far the hardest thing" he has ever done.
Abby Randall, from Southampton, was diagnosed with a rare bone cancer in 2013 when she was eight years old and died from the illness in 2016.Her parents set up Abby's Heroes to help and support children and their families who are under the care of the Piam Brown and Teenagers and Young Adults wards at Southampton General Hospital."It's sad but it's heart-warming to think that somebody so small had so much courage," Mr Morris said of Abby's story.
