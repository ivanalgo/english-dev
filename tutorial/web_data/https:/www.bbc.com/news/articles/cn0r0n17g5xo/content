A plan to make Gloucestershire a "UK capital" for cutting-edge industries has been given the go-ahead by Shire Hall bosses.Council leaders want to establish the county as a centre for the cyber, green energy, nuclear and agri-tech sectors.On Wednesday they approved a long-term version for Gloucestershire that drives growth following the scrapping of local economic partnerships in April.Council leader Mark Hawthorne said the strategy provides a “clear intent" for the county.
Gloucestershire's Economic Strategy, which runs until 2034, has been put together with input from residents, businesses and partners following a public engagement period held last year, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.The strategy also outlines how Gloucestershire will build on its strength as a prominent location in western England with ease of access to regional hubs in, and beyond, the Western Gateway.It is shaped by four main priorities: sustainable growth, inward investment, employment and skills, and business innovation and support.
The strategy sets out a plan to establish the county as a hub for the UK’s intelligence, security, and cyber agencies by 2050.It adds that as well as being a centre for world-leading, sustainable businesses it hopes to also preserve the county's "rich cultural and natural heritage".Mr Hawthorne said a strong local workforce is key to deliver long term economic growth.“Our genuine belief is that through this document and actions of local businesses in Gloucestershire and in part of the Western Gateway we can be the UK capital for many of these industries going forward," he said.“Getting that inward investment is really key. Whether it is cyber in Cheltenham and green energy in Berkeley, we are already seeing that commitment being made to our county.”Councillor David Gray, who is responsible for environment and planning at the council, said the need for co-operation across all levels of government is “one of the things driving the strategy”.
