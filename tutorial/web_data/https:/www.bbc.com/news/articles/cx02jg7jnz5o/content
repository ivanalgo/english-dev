A local authority has brought a legal action against a broadband operator after more than 400 homes remained without an ultrafast broadband service.Essex County Council had been working with Gigaclear since 2015 and said four contracts had been awarded to build a network that would bring full fibre broadband to rural areas.The council said it had decided to begin court proceedings against the firm for breach of contract, claiming three of those contracts remained unfulfilled.Gigaclear said it was aware of the legal proceedings and it would not be appropriate to comment at this stage.
The authority said it had taken steps to improve rural digital connectivity and affected residents had been notified of the legal action.The council said Gigaclear presented the best value of money for the taxpayer based on the proposed build. The contracts were expected to bring ultrafast broadband to more than 10,000 addresses.The council now say that more than 400 addresses in the Braintree, Colchester, Epping Forest and Uttlesford districts are still without access to ultrafast broadband.
Lee Scott, Cabinet Member for Planning a Growing Economy, said: "We have made every effort to resolve these issues with Gigaclear, supporting them throughout the process."It is deeply disappointing to be let down in this manner. "Rural connectivity is crucial, and our residents have been waiting patiently for better broadband access... connectivity they need and rightfully deserve."Gigaclear's head office is in Abingdon in Oxfordshire.Its chief executive Nathan Rundle said: "We have successfully delivered ultrafast full fibre broadband to over 90,000 properties in Essex to date. "Over 12,000 have been delivered using the top-up government subsidy programme. "We are aware of the application by Essex County Council and for legal reasons it is inappropriate for us to comment at this stage."The council said the case had been filed at the Technology and Construction Court in London, but no date had been set for a hearing.
