Acting Ch Insp Rebecca Wells-Cole said: “It is important we establish the facts of what happened, both for the man’s family and to reassure the wider public.“A proactive decision was taken to make three arrests at an early stage of this investigation in case there may have been any criminality involved.“This has enabled us to interview them under caution, with them having access to legal representation, and has furthered our understanding into what happened. "We have also studied CCTV footage and spoken to potential witnesses, after which a decision was made to release those three men under investigation yesterday evening.“We understand investigations of this nature can cause concern among the local community and we’d like to reassure the public there is no evidence of there being any wider risk to the public.“But we are carrying out high-visibility patrols in the area for reassurance and would urge anyone with concerns to please contact us.”
