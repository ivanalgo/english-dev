More than 1,500 people in Guernsey have been affected by personal data breaches in the first quarter of this year, according to the Office of the Data Protection Authority (ODPA).It is the highest number ever recorded in the island in one quarter.The OPDA is aiming to help organisations improve their breach preparedness.  The Bailiwick's Data Protection Commissioner Brent Homan said: “It is so important to view security safeguards as a dynamic rather than static responsibility."
Local organisations reported a total of 42 personal data breaches, affecting 1,536 people. The ODPA said it wanted people to be prepared and learn from these breaches to minimise the future risk of breachesThe majority of people affected were as a result of wayward emails containing personal information, it added.In a report the ODPA highlighted the importance of protecting personal information saying: "Breach of even one individual’s personal information can be high risk given its sensitivity and the potential for financial, reputational or psychological harms."Mr Homan added: "Organisations can think of breach preparedness like cruise control of a car. You can’t set it and then jump in the back seat and relax. "You must steer carefully, be aware of present dangers to you, your passengers and other road users and be prepared to confront unknown threats awaiting you at the turn of the road."To help people manage the risks of data breaches the ODPA will be releasing resources to business with key information, procedures  and things to look out for to keep personal information safe.
