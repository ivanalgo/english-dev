Renovation work to restore an island, lighthouse and causeway has begun.Whitley Bay's St Mary's Lighthouse, which was built in 1898, is being repaired, along with its buildings.The lighthouse and island will remain closed until mid-September, with the causeway reopening on 22 July.A spokesperson for North Tyneside Council said: "This investment is crucial to preserve the lighthouse for future generations."
Once the causeway opens in line with the school holidays, visitors can see the coastline and rockpools at low tide.Signs will be put up in the car park advising people of the opening times.
The lighthouse will be repainted, along with the keeper's cottages and the visitor centre.Windows and drainage will be repaired and replaced, as well as other general repairs.Project manager for North Tyneside Council, Ashley Laycock, said: "It's not a case of just fixing it."There's planning requirements, minor repairs, getting it washed down and a paint job."
The Labour-led local authority has been in consultation on how not to disturb the wildlife on the island.Mr Laycock added: "We had to highlight [the repairs] as a risk, with having seals on the island."We've worked with the wildlife conservation, and to be honest, the seals don't seem to be that bothered. "We've actually attracted more!" 
The lighthouse became Grade II listed in 2012, and has since then become a visitor centre.
