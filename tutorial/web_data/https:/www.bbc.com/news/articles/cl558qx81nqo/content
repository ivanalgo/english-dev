A new group of "determined" locals have teamed up to save the Spalding Flower Parade.An emergency meeting was called after former organiser Steve Timewell announced on 24 May he would no longer be running the event.Rebecca Roberts, Flower Queen of the 2024 parade, is part of the new team with around 10 other volunteers.A meeting will be held on 31 May with South Holland District Council to discuss plans for the event's future. 
With the event costing around £80,000, Ms Roberts said the committee had set up a fundraising page with a goal to raise £50,000.Mr Timewell, who organised the parade in 2023 and 2024, said he pulled out due to issues including a lack of council support and finding a replacement venue.Councillor Nick Worth, leader of South Holland District Council (SHDC), said it was "completely untrue" that the authority had not been supportive of the event.
Ms Roberts, 36, said: "We sat around the table and had a show of hands for who wants to continue and literally everyone put their hands up."We're absolutely devastated that Stephen won't be running it but we're really determined to keep it going."She added: "The key word is community, it brings together so many. "Anyone you speak to in Spalding knows the flower parade and has memories of it."
When he realised a team had pulled together to save the event, Mr Timewell said he was "utterly delighted".He said: "It's a testament to the hard work we've all done for the last two years.  I'm 100% behind them."Myself and my wife have lived and breathed the event for the past two years. It was very tough to say I can't do it anymore."I really do hope the team manage to get the support of the local council and have better luck in raising funding for next year than I did."
The parade is usually held at the Castle Sports Complex which is currently being refurbished.Beginning in the 1950s, the annual Spalding Flower Parade began as a celebration of the tulip industry.Mr Worth said: "As a council, we don't have that many fields that are available for the size they need, but we are willing to help."There's no reason why we can't find somewhere suitable."
