Members of the public are taking part in a "rare" opportunity to dig at the site of a Tudor mansion which was demolished more than 70 years ago.A two-week "community excavation" at Weald Country Park, in South Weald near Brentwood, Essex, starts on Monday.It is hoped the dig will uncover the history of Weald Hall, which was demolished in about 1953 after it was used by the military in World War Two.Tickets were available and have since been sold to 24 archaeology enthusiasts aged between 17 and 78.
The project has been funded by the Lower Thames Crossing Community Fund and is part of the Council for British Archaeology's annual festival.Maria Medlycott, senior historic environment officer at the consultancy Place Services which is leading the dig, said: "We're looking for footprints of the buildings because there are so many things you can't tell about buildings from photos and drawings."The participants include current and future archaeology students, retirees, and people considering a career change into archaeology.
