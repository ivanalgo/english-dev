A community organisation has marked a successful first four years by helping to raise £300,000 for independent businesses.Up The Garden Bath was launched in 2020 by Dave Poulton from Peterborough, who takes donated unwanted bathtubs and upcycles them into flower beds around Cambridgeshire.Last year, it launched the Unity store in Queensgate shopping centre as a platform for dozens of independent and small businesses to sell their products.Mr Poulton said the project had hit a “landmark" after 150 local artists and small businesses were supported by it.
On Tuesday, a celebratory event at Queensgate was attended by the mayor and more than 100 people and business owners."Most charities and community projects do it the other way and are asking for money," said Mr Poulton."We seem to have got it upside down and are raising our own money and helping others do the same, so it is a real community collaborative project.“I piloted the scheme in 2019 and our initial aims were to upcycle some bathtubs into planters to teach children with.“We launched in 2020, which was probably the worst time ever to launch a business - let alone a community project - when people were all locked in their houses."He added: “They say a rising tide lifts all boats, and apparently we are the tide, so we might as well help these other local businesses.“Last Christmas, one vendor said our help helped them buy Christmas presents for their kids, and if that does not galvanise us and keep us going, nothing will."The group, which has been nominated in the BBC's Make a Difference Awards, is working on plans for Peterborough’s largest community garden.It has secured seven acres of land for the project, and work is expected to start in September.Up The Garden Bath has upcycled and installed more than 70 bathtubs across Cambridgeshire.
