An art gallery in East Sussex says a Donald Trump sculpture has been attracting hundreds of people after he became the first former US president to be a convicted felon.The silicone and fibreglass sculpture at W Gallery in Rye has been catching the attention of locals and tourists in the medieval town.Gallery owner Wendy Bowker, 62, said she had been “inundated” with people coming in to see it.Trump was found guilty last week of falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments to former adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election campaign.
“We are getting hundreds of people come in all different ages and nationalities,” said Ms Bowker.“These little kids are tiny but they know who Trump is. They are getting photos with him and taking selfies - it’s incredible.“It has blown me off balance, I am inundated. People look from outside, down the street or they come in."
Artist John Humphreys, 69, from Norman’s Bay, originally made the sculpture in 2022 using clay before moulding it with silicone and casting it in fibre glass. He then spent hours painting it.Mr Humphreys said: “I think Donald Trump is an interesting character, quite a controversial character. I’m interested in sculpting people of interest to the general public."The artist added: “There’s massive interest in Donald Trump because of the latest controversies he has been involved with.“I am really pleased with the response it has got,” he said.
