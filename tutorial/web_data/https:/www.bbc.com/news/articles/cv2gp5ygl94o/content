Bus campaigners in Kent said they doubt local services will improve despite reforms pledged by the new Labour government.The Better Buses Bill, presented in the King’s Speech on Monday, will hand local leaders powers to franchise buses and lifts restrictions on new publicly owned bus operators.Sue Wood, 77, who has campaigned against bus cuts in Folkstone, questioned how the plans would be financed.She said: “If the government bring back our local bus services, great. But I can’t see how they can afford it.”
Stagecoach has scrapped or reduced several bus services in Folkstone since the end of the pandemic.It says rising costs and falling passenger numbers forced it to consider “some very difficult options”.
Richard Shannon, a bus campaigner in east Kent, was also sceptical bus services could be improved.“It’s a load of hot air,” he said. “There are too many people interfering and too many stakeholders.”Mr Shannon, who fought against cuts in Sittingbourne and Faversham, is critical of efforts by previous governments and local authorities.He said: “We’ve been down this road before."The King’s Speech only outlines upcoming policies with their exact nature ironed out in later legislation.Ms Wood said it was unclear how the bill would work in practice, though she “would like to see Labour succeed.”She said her area of Lynwood has “abysmal” bus services, which leaves elderly, disabled and poorer individuals isolated, while affecting local businesses.
The government has said the Better Buses Bill would “help bring an end to the postcode lottery of bus services and will give local communities throughout England the power to take back control of their bus services.“It will mean local leaders can decide to introduce better bus networks, at pace, which reflect the needs of the local communities that rely on them.”A spokesperson from Kent County Council said: "Any concerns regarding bus services and performance should be taken up with the local bus company who are responsible."We are pleased that bus services were recognised in the King's Speech as they are an important part in people’s lives and the economy."The Prime Minster's Office and Stagecoach have been approached for comment.
