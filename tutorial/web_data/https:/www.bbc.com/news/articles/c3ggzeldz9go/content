A bench has been unveiled at a pub in memory of a murdered backpacker and her father.Grace Millane, from Wickford, Essex, was killed in New Zealand in 2018 and her father David later died from cancer.Grace's mother Gillian said the bench at the family's local pub was "a work of art"."Thank you doesn't seem to be enough for all the kindness and support everyone has shown me and my family over the last few years," she said."But a massive thank you to each and every one of you."
She added: "I am truly blessed to live in such a lovely village with such an amazing group of people, to go from a simple 'hello' when I am walking around the village to you all coming together creating something so beautiful for David and Grace."The bench, at The Fox and Hounds in Billericay, has the names Grace and David Millane on one side and the quote "live your life with a smile" on the other.Sarah Hood, from the pub, who helped organise the tribute, said: "You may not be with us but you always now have a space at our table." Gillian Millane recently gained an OBE for her charity work after she founded the initiative Love Grace, which has collected 20,000 handbags and filled them with useful items for domestic abuse victims.
