The Lyra McKee murder trial has been shown police footage of the moment the journalist was shot.Four gunshots were fired and screaming could be heard after the 29-year-old was hit by a bullet.The footage, from a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) camera, then showed Ms McKee being carried into a police Land Rover.Ms McKee had been observing a riot in the Creggan estate in Londonderry in April 2019 when she was killed.
The New IRA admitted responsibility for the killing.Three men from Derry are on trial at Belfast Crown Court accused of the 29-year-old’s murder.They are Peter Cavanagh, 35, of Mary Street in Derry; Jordan Devine, 23, of Bishop Street; and Paul McIntyre, 56, of Kells Walk.Seven other men from Derry are facing trial on a number of lesser charges, including rioting and throwing a petrol bomb on the night Ms McKee died.They are: Joseph Patrick Barr, 38, of Sandringham Drive; Jude McCrory, 26, of Gartan Square; William Patrick Elliott, 57, of Ballymagowan Gardens; Joseph Anthony Campbell, 23, of Gosheden Cottages; Patrick Anthony Gallagher, 32, of John Field Place; Kieran George McCool, 55, of Ballymagowan Gardens; and Christopher Joseph Gillen, 43, of Balbane Pass.
A prosecution barrister told the court that an initial gunshot prompted the police camera to pan in on a gunman.He said the gunman could be seen firing a second shot, before the gun misfired.The barrister added: “He then succeeds in firing two further shots. It is only after the fourth shot, some 20 seconds after the first, that screaming can be heard indicating that Ms McKee has been struck by a bullet.“This tends to indicate that she was shot by one of the last two rounds, most likely the final shot.”Ms McKee had been visible in the police footage wearing "a distinctive hooded top" before the shooting, standing near a lamppost by a police Land Rover.Further mobile phone footage filmed by a member of the crowd at the disorder was also shown to the court.It showed the masked gunman firing the shots, following "cheering" from the gathered crowd.
It is not the prosecution's case that any of the three men accused of murder was the gunman.The barrister continued: "It is submitted that the actions of McIntyre, Devine and Cavanagh are demonstrative of their involvement in the joint enterprise to possess and fire the weapon with the requisite intent for murder."That is they offer intentional encouragement or assistance to the possession and use of the weapon with that intent."Earlier, the court heard that an MTV crew filming the riot on the night Ms McKee was killed were told the disorder had been “set up” for the camera.TV presenter Reggie Yates and the crew were in Derry filming a documentary.A prosecution barrister showed the court unedited MTV clips of police vehicles being attacked by masked men throwing petrol bombs. In the video footage, Mr Yates commented that parents were "bringing their children out to watch"."Teenage girls eating their dinner while they watch this,” he was heard saying.Another piece of footage showed one woman at the scene of the disorder who could be heard telling the film crew: “The people of Creggan are suffering for youse. It was all set up for youse."Tomorrow there will be no buses, there will be no postmen, all because of youse."The presenter, Reggie Yates, was then heard on camera saying: “If people are saying we’re inciting it, then maybe we should call it a night.”As he confirmed the crew was going to leave, Mr Yates added: “This feels like it could go in so many different directions.”The court was told that one of the defendants on trial, Jude McCrory, who is charged with rioting and throwing a petrol bomb, was heard telling the presenter: “I hope you don’t miss any more camera opportunities."Several members of Ms McKee’s family were in attendance in court on Friday.The case continues.
