Remembrance events in Sleaford town centre will go ahead this November despite works to improve the town's Market Place. Residents were concerned that overrunning renovation works to the car park at St Denys Church would mean the annual ceremony and parade would face disruption.Jon Darrington-Slegg, Chairman of the Royal British Legion's Sleaford Branch, said  they now "have the bare bones of a strategy" to hold both Remembrance and Armistice events. Councillor Richard Wright, leader of North Kesteven District Council, said the authority's role was to support the event, and there were "a number of options" available to event organisers. 
Mr Darrington-Slegg said fencing around the memorial would ensure wreath laying could continue as normal as well as a parade. "We have exercised our right to parade here for at least 100 years so there’s going to be no change to that," he said. He added the town would "always be out in force" no matter how the arrangements might be affected by the building work.Mr Wright said a working group had been set up between the Royal British Legion, Sleaford Town Council and North Kesteven District Council to ensure the event goes ahead.He said he wanted to "make it clear" organisations were working together and added the Royal British Legion were "doing a fantastic job" of ensuring a service takes place.He said more information would be available closer to the event.
Plans were announced to make changes to the Market Place in July 2023, but have faced delays after public objections saw the project being deferred twice.As well as new seating and planted areas, the renovation work, part-funded by £1m from the government, will include new lighting and bollards, with the aim of making the memorial more visible all year round.Under the plans, the market would continue on three days a week, but the car park would remain closed.Work is expected to be complete in December.
