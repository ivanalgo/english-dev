Staff at Greater Manchester's Metrolink Bee tram network will strike over pay during the summer.Unite members said a 4.5% pay rise coming on the back of successive below-inflation pay increases was "intolerable".The strike is due to take place on 25, 26 and 27 July during Peter Kay's stand-up show at the AO Arena, UFC 304 and Manchester's City Centre Day. Metrolink's operator, KeolisAmey said they were "disappointed" pay talks have been unsuccessful but "remain committed to meaningful discussions". 
Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said he hoped KeolisAmey and the union could between them avert the industrial action.Speaking to BBC Radio Manchester following his announcement of a major expansion of the Bee Network Mr Burham did not say whether he would intervene in the dispute.But he said he would be keeping the situation "under review".He said he "[didn't] want to have a situation where our passengers are inconvenienced" but neither did he want a situation where "there are disagreements between the unions and the operator".He added: "We need to look after [the staff], but we have to do it in a way that is reasonable, and what we can afford."Metrolink is a joint venture between the companies Keolis and Amey, who run it on behalf of Transport for Greater Manchester.A Unite spokesman said members wanted guarantees of above-inflation rises over the next three years and a reduction in the pay progression scales within the drivers and customer service roles.They said "furious" staff have to wait four years to get to the top of their pay scales, and as a result lose up to £15,000, despite doing the exact same job as colleagues.
Colin Hayden, Unite regional officer, described the current pay offer as "woeful".  "This dispute is entirely the making of Metrolink and their parent companies. "They can easily afford to pay our members a decent salary after years of real-terms pay cuts."I urge Metrolink, their parent companies and TfGM to come back with an improved offer rather than continue to demonstrate how little they value their own staff and the communities of Greater Manchester," he said.Damien Chabas, managing director of KeolisAmey, said they believed its offer through to 2026 "provides stability and security" against inflation increases, and was a "fair deal"."There was also an offer of £0.5m investment to address the historical pay structure raised by Unite, however this was rejected by them," Mr Chabas said."We have a positive track record of fair pay negotiations because we care about our people."Mr Chabas added since the start of their contract in 2017, employees had received pay increases of more than 30%, with some employees receiving over 38%.He said: "Last year was an exceptional year for inflation, yet our employees still received a pay increase of 6.5% plus a £1,000 one off payment, amounting to an approximate 9% increase."
