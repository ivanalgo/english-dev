A Devon village is to lose one of its two pubs, despite a campaign by villagers to save it.They claimed the Red Lion at Tedburn St Mary was a "force for good" in the community, and could reopen as a pub after being closed for two years.But the owner told Teignbridge District Council’s planning committee he could not keep it going any longer and it needed to be converted into houses.Councillors voted by a large majority to allow the pub to be converted into housing.
Villagers raised money towards buying the pub after having the property listed as an official asset of community value.Supporters said buyers were interested in taking it on as a pub again, reported the Local Democracy Reporting Service.But owner Terry Tume told the meeting: "The village doesn’t want to lose the Red Lion, but a business cannot survive without customers and their money."He said the planned development of four houses would meet a local need for homes.
Objector Martin Rich said: "It is viable as a pub."Its loss would significantly diminish our community."Councillor David Cox supported the campaigners and said: "There are people prepared to buy it and run it as a pub. "It was bought as a pub, and it should be sold as a pub."
