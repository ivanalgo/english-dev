Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council’s chief executive is stepping down after five years at the helm.Martin Hamilton will leave his position as chief executive at the end of March 2024.A council spokesperson said he intends to take a short sabbatical before looking for a new challenge.Mr Hamilton joined the council in 2019 from Dorset Councils Partnership.
He previously held senior roles at local authorities in Cardiff and Southampton.Mr Hamilton played a leading role in reorganising the council’s internal operation and reduced running costs, a spokesperson said. He has also overseen thousands of hours of work related to controversial landfill site Walleys Quarry in Silverdale.
Mr Hamilton said: “Walleys Quarry alone would be a major challenge for any organisation of our size, and I am proud of how the council has worked, within the limited powers it has, to deal with the site operator and other agencies.“At the same time we have attracted millions of pounds’ worth of investment for Newcastle and Kidsgrove, which will create jobs, redevelop Knutton and change the face of our town centres.”
A recent independent inspection of the council by the Local Government Association praised the authority’s strong leadership, financial stability and ability to attract “enviable” amounts of government funding.Council leader Simon Tagg, praised Mr Hamilton, saying the area had benefitted from his leadership.“On behalf of colleagues and residents I thank him for all his efforts to run services efficiently and helping to make the borough a better place for our residents,” he said.Recruitment for a new chief executive will begin in due course, according to the council.
