A Brighton primary school will close for the final time on Friday despite protests by parents, staff and students.St Peter's Community Primary School in Portslade will not reopen after the summer holidays as Brighton & Hove City Council agreed to close it.It comes amid falling pupil numbers in the area.The school has previously described the move as "devastating", while several protests have taken place in an effort to prevent the closure.
St Bartholomew's Church of England Primary School in Brighton is also set to close due to a drop in pupil numbers, and has similarly sparked opposition among parents and staff.Its headteacher, Katie Blood, has previously said she was "heartbroken" by the move.It will close on 31 December, but the school has been encouraging parents to move pupils at the start of the new school term."We have had a full week of joyous events to celebrate everything wonderful that is St Barts," Ms Blood told the BBC this week. "We are so grateful for our amazing community and for the support they have given us particularly over the last year."St Peter's Community Primary School has been contacted for comment.Councillor Jacob Taylor, co-chair of the council's schools committee, previously said: "The way the government school funding formula works means that empty places have a serious impact on the resources and teaching available to pupils."Reducing the number of school places is the right thing to do to secure the long-term future of our schools."In a letter written to St Peter's school staff this week, he thanked them for the "caring and professional way" they had supported children moving on to new schools.
