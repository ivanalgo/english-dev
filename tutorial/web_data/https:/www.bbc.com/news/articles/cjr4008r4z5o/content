A bridge in York which is vulnerable to flooding will be usable in "all but the worse" conditions after the path leading to it was raised, City of York Council has said.Millennium Bridge crosses the River Ouse, linking the South Bank area of York to Fulford and the University of York, and is often used by cyclists and joggers. The path on either side of the bridge has been raised by 60cm, with drainage pipes under the path also installed to allow flood water to drain under the route.Councillor Kate Ravilious, executive member for transport, said the work was meant to "keep this important link open for everyone".
Last year, Peter Kilbane, deputy leader of City of York Council, said that raising the path leading up to Millennium Bridge had "certainly been talked about for around seven years".Mr Kilbane, who at the time was the city's transport executive, made the comments in December after he delayed plans to raise the pathway due to the length of time required for the Environment Agency to approve the work. Andy D’Agorne, from the Green Party, added that "this essential link is now flooded pretty well every winter".Work to raise the path finally began on Monday 17 June and was completed on Sunday 21 July, according to the council.York has been hit by flooding and high river levels several times this year due to persistent wet weather.North Yorkshire was hit with a month's worth of rainfall in the first half of April, causing disruption to outdoor sports clubs and people’s homes being flooded.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
