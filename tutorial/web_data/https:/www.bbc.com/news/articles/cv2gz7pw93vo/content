A series of free events are set to take place along the Kent coast to celebrate National Marine Week.Rockpooling in Folkestone and a family walk at Pegwell Bay are among the events organised by Kent Wildlife Trust.Protected area warden Nina Jones said: "Rocky shores, muddy estuaries and sandy beaches are wonderful places to explore."She said the free events aimed to "inspire and educate people about the wonders of marine wildlife" and the importance of its protection. 
National Marine Week starts on Saturday and runs until 11 August. This year's theme is 'sea the connection', which looks at the diverse ways people feel connected with the sea. 
In Folkestone there is a family rockpooling event at Lower Leas Coastal Park on 26 and 27 July. At Pegwell Bay, in Thanet, there is a beach clean on 30 July; a family walk on 31 July; family adventures on 7 August and a summer wildlife walk on 9 August. The events must be booked in advance. 
Kent Wildlife Trust said its research showed marine conservation was a top environmental priority for people. Ms Jones said: "Ensuring better protection of our seas will aid in the recovery of coastal and marine habitats. "It will help ensure that large amounts of carbon remain stored in natural habitats such as mud, seagrass, and saltmarsh. "Improved protections for our seas will result in healthier waters, benefiting everyone."
