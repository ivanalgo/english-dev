Plans for 221 new homes on a Surrey golf club could be a "disaster" for the community, opponents say.An application for the new homes, as well as a GP surgery, cafe and green space, has been submitted for Hersham Golf Club.There have been 665 objections submitted to the council, with six letters sent in support.The applicant said 93% of the green belt between Esher and Hersham would be unaffected by the development.
Those in support have highlighted the need for more homes in the area, especially the 111 affordable ones included in the plans.Colin Southgate, a resident of nearby East Molesey, acknowledged the area was "short of houses".But he told BBC Radio Surrey: "I think it would be a disaster for the local community. "It's a really nice golf course, it suits all age groups and a site like this should never, ever be built upon."The plans, produced by Claudel Venture Holdings Ltd, the landowner, have been amended following public consultation, with the number of homes reduced from 636 to 221.
Development would now focus on the previously built-up parts of the course, the applicant said.A spokesperson said new green spaces, as well as improving biodiversity, would "provide a natural barrier" around the new homes.The spokesperson added: "This is a highly sustainable location for new housing with the site located near to Hersham station."
But Roy Green, chairman of Hersham Village Society, said they have been fighting applications on the site since 1984.He added: "It isn't just greenbelt issues. It's also traffic, it's the infrastructure."We don't have the schools, we don't have the doctors' surgeries to cope with an influx of another 200-odd houses."He said he believed the village had taken its "fair share" of new homes.The application is due to come to Elmbridge Borough Council's planning committee in June.
