Police have taken powers to disperse anti-social behaviour from a town centre this weekend, after a spate of crime including a fatal stabbing in recent weeks.The order covers the centre of Nuneaton, Warwickshire, within the ring road, plus Riversley Park and the retail area around Asda.It will be in place for 48 hours from 17:00 BST on Friday.Insp Ryan Walker from Warwickshire Police said the decision was not taken lightly, "but the police, and I’m sure the law-abiding people of Nuneaton, have decided that enough is enough".
Police linked the order to incidents including the stabbing of Tom Ellis on 8 June, and an arrest the following weekend of a 17-year-old after CCTV showed a knife being carried.Then on Thursday, three people wearing balaclavas were arrested after a chase from King Edward Road to Rope Walk car park. "This weekend we’re being proactive and sending out a strong message that we will not tolerate any kind of violence or anti-social behaviour in our town," said Insp Walker. “This dispersal order gives officers the power to move anti-social groups away from the area and in some cases return them home to their parents."He added there was no place for violence and anti-social behaviour in Nuneaton and said officers would take "robust measures" against anyone involved.
