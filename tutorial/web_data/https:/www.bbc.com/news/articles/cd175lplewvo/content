A north-east town is holding its first Pride event celebrating the local LGBTQIA+ community.Hartlepool Pop-up Pride will take place around Church Square on Saturday 6 July, with a range of free events and live performances.The programme has been organised by Pride in Tees Valley and coordinated by Newcastle-based charity Curious Arts. Chief executive Phil Douglas said: "Pride events are just so important for breaking down barriers, and making people feel included and valued".
Events will be held across two locations in the town.Hartlepool Art Gallery will host arts and craft activities for families, including storyteller Pam the Dinner Lady.The Bobby Dazzler stage in Church Square will host live performances, with a Pride Market held from 1100-1500 BST at the Northern School of Art.There will also be a team of volunteers on hand at the Curious Caravan "capturing the memories of Hartlepool's first Pride event", and celebrating stories from the local LGBTQIA+ community."It might be how you came out to your family, or where you had your first date, or your first kiss," explained Mr Douglas."We hope to begin to put together a social history of the LGBTQIA+ community here in Hartlepool," he added.
The pop-up event came into being following an online survey which received more than 200 responses, with many backing the idea of a Pride event in the town.Adam Strickland, creative producer at Curious Arts, said the online reponses had provided "the little spark needed" to deliver Saturday's event."I was born and raised in Hartlepool, and it will be so wonderful for me to see the town come together and support people who just want to be themselves and not live in fear," he said. Pride in Tees Valley is also organising Cleveland Pride  in Saltburn on Sunday 7 July.
