Nearly three times as many children need their teeth removed in hospital in Swindon than other areas in the south west, according to a new report. The report found 1,045 children and young people per 100,000 of Swindon's population need extractions compared to just 376 in the rest of the region.Caroline Gaulton, head of public health, children and young people at Swindon Borough Council complied the report and found most of those affected came from deprived areas and from families with an Asian heritage.Ms Gaulton said: “The pain can affect a child’s sleep and their attendance at school and their ability to learn and socialise with other children.”
Ms Gaulton said: “This is a particular problem here and the oral health of children and young people has been made a priority for public health."The majority of these occur under general anaesthetic, which poses additional health risks.”Swindon Borough Council said it has taken steps to make improvements already by creating a specialist one-year position in the public health team to lead on oral health intervention.First Dental Steps has also been created which will see health visitors talk to and give oral health advice to parents at a child's one-year health check, the Local Democracy Reporting Service added. Alongside this Ms Gaulton shared the public health nursing team has had "top-up" training in how to promote oral health. Council staff have also visited schools to teach children how to properly brush their teeth.Ms Gaulton said it was targeting schools in the areas of highest deprivation. She added there had been some pushback from schools about the extra responsibility."We have been experiencing a little bit of pushback. Sixty per cent of schools have signed up, but 40 per cent have not, and I think they feel that this is yet another thing they’re being asked to do, and it’s properly a parent’s job,” she said.The council has got five different organisations working with them including the Harbour Project, City of Sanctuary, Bangladesh Centre, Brunel Trust and one nursery school.
