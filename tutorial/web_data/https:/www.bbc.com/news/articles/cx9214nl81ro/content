A woman has denied the murder of a baby boy who was found in a woodland close to a theme park more than a quarter of a century ago.The infant, whose remains were discovered close to the Gulliver’s World theme park in Warrington, Cheshire, on 14 March 1998.He was named Callum by police after the Callands district where he was found.Joanne Sharkey, 54, of Denham Close in West Derby, Liverpool, pleaded not guilty to murder and concealment of the birth of a child at Liverpool Crown Court and was bailed ahead of a further hearing in October.
Ms Sharkey wore a black blazer suit with a patterned blouse and spoke only to confirm her name and enter her plea.Prosecutor Nicola Daley told the court a pre-trial hearing was needed to investigate further psychiatric and psychological reports and medical reports surrounding the infant’s death.Rebecca Filletti, defending, said experts were being sought to consider the mental state of Ms Sharkey at the time.
Cheshire Police said a man who was arrested as part of its investigation had since been released without charge.After the baby, who has never been formally identified, was found in March 1998, local people arranged a burial and a funeral service was held.The headstone, which was paid for with money raised by the community, bore an inscription dedicated to "Baby Callum, precious child of God".It added the child was "laid to rest July 27, 1998, with love, from the people of Warrington".
