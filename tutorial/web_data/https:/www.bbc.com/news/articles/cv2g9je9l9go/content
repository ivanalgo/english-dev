A summer fete is being put on at a school to celebrate its 60th anniversary.Debenham High School in the village of Debenham, Suffolk, opened in 1964, with its main building still dating back to that year. The fete, taking place on Saturday, will also include an exhibition filled with photos of former and current students.Dominque Scanlan, secretary of the Friends of Debenham High School committee, said the school community felt like a family. 
"Every parent is invested by default for their school's successes, but I feel it really keenly with Debenham because we all genuinely feel like a family," she explained."The village and the local community have had a bit of a tough time lately with flooding and some real big challenges, so this is a particularly nice event - a celebration for the school, but for everyone as well."
Storm Babet in October left many residents in the village without a home.Ms Scanlan said the committee was keen to ensure the anniversary event helped support the village, with many of the stalls being local.Many current students have also been out helping in various ways."At a time when raising children in a world where everything is a little unsteady and things are changing all the time, it's really nice to send them to a school that's been steadfast in the community for the past 60 years," she added.Head teacher Simon Martin, who is only the fifth headteacher, said the strength of the school was its community."Academic results are really important, but they are built upon a community who cares for each other and looks out for each other," he said."Our 60th anniversary is a real time to celebrate that with our wider community, who are such an important part of our school."
