Work has begun on a housing development in Godalming that will see two of its four homes used to alleviate homelessness.Waverley council, developers Ermine Construction and Homes England are building four one-bedroom apartments to help meet social and affordable housing need, the authority said.Planning papers said that two homes would provide rough sleeper accommodation which would be partly grant-funded by Homes England.The Surrey council said the homes would be net zero with enhanced insulation, air-source heat pumps and solar panels to provide hot water and energy.
Councillor Paul Rivers said: “We are one of the few local authorities who still own and manage our council homes."We are proud of this, and the support we can give to all our residents, including those who are more vulnerable."Councillor Janet Crowe said the scheme, on brownfield land, was transforming an old garage site into affordable and sustainable new homes.Work at Aarons Hill, off Eashing Road, is expected to take about 10 months to complete, finishing early next year.Debbie Smith, provider manager for the Rough Sleepers Accommodation Programme at Homes England, said the programme would provide "high-quality homes and support for some of the most vulnerable members of our society, who are sleeping rough or at risk of homelessness”.
