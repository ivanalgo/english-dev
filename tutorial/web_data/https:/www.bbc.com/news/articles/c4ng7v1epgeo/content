A food bank charity is aiming to create the longest line of food donations in a day.Horsham Matters runs the Horsham District Foodbank, in West Sussex, and is asking the community to bring donations to Bridge Leisure Centre on 9 July between 09:00-20:00 BST.The donations will be lined up along the athletic track to make a Tin Trail.The charity says it is continuing to see a huge demand for their service.
So far this year it has provided almost 4,500 individual food parcels, of which 1,800 were for children. Alongside this, food donations have fallen dramatically and have led to the charity making its urgent plea for donations.
Managing director Emma Elnaugh said “Sadly, food donations have dropped to critically low levels, and we are desperate to raise stock levels to ensure that we can continue to meet the demand.“We are asking our community to support our campaign to ensure that no one goes hungry.”In addition to its foodbank services, which include the Hub on the Move mobile foodbank, the charity aims to tackle the root causes of poverty by providing household budgeting support, benefits checks, advocacy support and counselling for those experiencing food poverty.The charity recently unveiled its mobile advice service, Support on the Move, taking its advice support to the outlying areas of Horsham district.
