A team of archaeologists have uncovered hundreds of relics in Grimsby town centre.Volunteers from the North Lincolnshire Archaeology and History Society made the discovery after digging in Bethlehem Street.The base of a medieval wall with tool marks still visible was among the items found.The team also uncovered 200 oyster shells, as well as glass, pottery and bones,  which they described as "remarkable".
The dig is taking place in the back garden of the arts and heritage charity Our Big Picture, which is based in a Grade II listed building.This is the second archaeological dig to take place there after more than 3,000 artefacts were dug up in 2023.Site director Peter Allen told BBC Radio Humberside he believes he knows where the oysters came from: "It isn't a surprise because there is a picture of a shop, which was where we are digging, with the sign Cleethorpes Oysters."The dig has been live streamed and a family arts day is taking place later for people to see the discoveries and to also handle some of the finds.Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
