People caught dumping waste in Barnsley could soon be fined up to £1,000, under a new policy approved by the local authority. The scheme, which will come into effect in August, marks a £600 rise in the maximum penalty which can be given to fly-tippers in the town. Government legislation allowing councils to hand out four-figure fines to those guilty of fly-tipping was introduced last year.Anyone caught dumping more than six bags of waste could be liable to pay the maximum amount, the council said.
Barnsley Council spent £265,000 on clearing and disposing of litter and fly-tipping during 2022/23, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.The council said the higher fine would target "those more likely to fly tip as a criminal enterprise".The maximum fine for graffitiing will also double from £100 to £200, as it costs the council at least £200 to remove.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
