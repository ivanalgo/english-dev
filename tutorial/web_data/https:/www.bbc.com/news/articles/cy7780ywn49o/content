Plans for a gas-fired power plant and concrete crushing activity at an old quarry would "contradict" carbon emissions targets in Wales, an MS has said. Ruthin-based engineering firm Jones Bros has applied for permission to use the former Seiont Brickworks near Caernarfon, Gwynedd.The proposal sets public health and environmental "alarm bells", campaigners said, while Arfon MS Siân Gwenllian wants it rejected on climate grounds.Jones Bros said it would provide back-up power when wind and solar output is low, "giving consumers the confidence that their energy needs will be met". 
The scheme has undergone a pre-application consultation with Planning and Environment Decisions Wales (PEDW), Gwynedd's council and statutory consultees.“Ten natural gas fuelled engines, and associated infrastructure... would be used to sell power back to the National Grid," the application says.The connection to the grid would be via underground lines and the plant “would not require any permanent employees to operate".
Concerns from the Caernarfon Lân group include air pollution, noise and traffic from the site affecting nearby homes and a hospital, as well as impacts on wildlife, the environment and climate change.The group's Gretel Leeb said the location “should set alarm bells ringing” due to the topography, surrounding housing estates, a local park and sports fields, the River Seiont and ancient woodland.Plaid MS Ms Gwenllian spoke in the Senedd to claim the proposal “contradicted the spirit and aims of the Well-being of Future Generations Act and the Welsh government’s climate targets, and should be rejected".Since then, proposals for concrete crushing at the site had “emerged,” she added.Gwynedd's council concluded it was “likely the impact of the development on the environment” would require the submission of an environmental statement.Jones Bros previously said: “To maximise the switch to renewable electricity generation, the national grid requires back-up power when solar and wind outputs are low.“Short-term operating reserve plants using mains gas can be put into operation at a few minutes’ notice to provide this back-up, giving consumers the confidence that their energy needs will be met and encouraging them to choose electricity as their source.“The project is classed as a ‘development of national significance’, as it can produce more than 10MW of energy, so under Welsh government regulations, ministers will decide on the development rather than the local authority.”A consultation on the proposals ends on June 14, 2024.
