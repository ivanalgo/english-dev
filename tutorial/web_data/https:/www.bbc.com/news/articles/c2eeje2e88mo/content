Student-run food hubs offering surplus fruit and vegetables have been launched at schools in West Sussex.The initiative, called Grub Hub, aims to stop food ending up in landfills and help families have easier access to healthy and nutritious food.Students at 10 schools in Chichester will run their own food donation sites once a week with aim of ending food waste.Emily Ellis, deputy headteacher at one of the schools, said they hope it helps children "learn about the importance of helping and supporting everyone in our community".
The scheme, set up by UKHarvest, is funded through a donation from the King Charles III Charitable Fund.Students and parents can take surplus food bags which have been donated by a range of food producers, farmers and growers and distributors.
UKHarvest said it aims to provide food for up to 40 people per school.Clare Corbitt, a mother of two from Chichester who has begun using the initiative, said it was a “fantastic idea”.“My two daughters decided together what food to use in our dinner that evening, and what we could use up for breakfast and lunch the next day,” she said.“It's a massive help for me, and lovely to see the children come up with meal ideas."Ms Ellis, deputy headteacher at Birdham CE Primary School, said the scheme was not a food bank.“It’s not means tested, so any of our families can come and take a bag,” she told BBC Radio Sussex. “But we do also make sure as well that they go to some of our more disadvantaged families and refugee families.“We hope that this gives the children the chance to learn about the importance of ensuring we are all nourished and cared for and reinforcing our values to love learning, love our world and love each other.”
