It is now offering "Dandelion bears" designed for siblings who have lost a brother or sister.The charity said their bears offered comfort and support to grieving parents and hoped the new edition would help children.It said it hoped some businesses would come forward to sponsor the bears to help send them into hospitals and comfort children during their time of grief.
"With the “Bear Hug” campaign, we aim to extend this comfort to siblings, who are often the silent sufferers of such profound loss," said the charity.Helen Gallagher added, "We believe that by offering these bears, we can provide them with a measure of comfort and a symbol of enduring love from their baby brother or sister.”“With the help of businesses, we can ensure that as many children as possible, who have lost a sibling, will receive a Dandelion bear, helping them to feel less alone and more supported during such a difficult time."
