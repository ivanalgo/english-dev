A statue has been given new fingers to mark the 350th birthday of one of England's most influential hymn-writers.The monument to Isaac Watts stands in Southampton's Watts Park and has been damaged by of a combination of erosion and perched seagulls.Mr Watts is credited with being the first person to write hymns in the English language, which helped religion become more accessible.The Lord Mayor, councillors, clergy and members of the public gathered for a celebratory event on Tuesday which included music, drama and poetry performances.
Rev Vic Jackopson was one of those who attended the event and he said: "The finger has been put back for the birthday party so Isaac Watts has a present."He added: "We call him the father of the English hymn, everything that has come since then dates back to Isaac Watts here in Southampton."These hymns are sung in every nation of the world."
Mr Watts was born in Above Bar Street in Southampton and is considered by many to be the city's most famous son.He was a Minister, theologian and hymn writer who wrote around 750 songs of praise into English for the first time, many of which remain in use today.It is his music that plays when the clock tower at Southampton civic centre strikes the hour.
