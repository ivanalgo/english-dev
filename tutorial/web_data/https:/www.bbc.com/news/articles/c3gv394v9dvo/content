Glasgow's TRNSMT festival is in full swing, with dozens of artists still to perform on Sunday.The sunshine and blue skies that greeted festival goers on the opening day of Scotland's biggest music festival on Friday turned to overcast skies and drizzle for the second day.About 50,000 attended TRNSMT festival on Friday, headlined by Liam Gallagher.Music fans basked in the sunshine at Glasgow Green and watched artists such as Garbage, Sugababes and even a secret set by Scottish rockers Travis.On Saturday, Rick Astley wowed revellers by performing AC/DC's Highway to Hell and Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes, as well as his big hit Never Gonna Give You Up.And Gerry Cinnamon kept fans entertained throughout his headline slot until the end of the night.Acts including Calvin Harris, Enter Shikari and English Teacher will perform on Sunday, the festival's final day.
During her performance on Saturday, Natasha Bedingfield asked fans to sing a Lewis Capaldi song with her - to share on TikTok.She told the crowd: "I opened for Lewis Capaldi at the O2 about two years ago, maybe we could sing a bit of his song and he can write a song for me."She held up her phone to record the crowd as she sang Lewis Capaldi's song Someone You Loved, and they joined in.Bedingfield, 42, also dedicated a song to her older brother Daniel, who rose to fame in 2001 - three years before her.She got fans dancing as she performed her major hits Single and UK number one hit, These Words, both from 2004, along with Cover's of Coldplay's The Scientist and Prince's Purple Rain.Bedingfield closed the set with her song Unwritten.
Fans were not the only ones enamoured with the clear skies and high energy of the crowds on Friday.Sugababes told BBC News their TRNSMT experience had been "just as much fun" as their recent stint at Glastonbury.Performing in their original line-up, Keisha Buchanan, Mutya Buena and Siobhan Donaghy were in such high demand at the Somerset festival that organisers had to shut off their stage.Keisha said the reunited band were "immensely grateful" to get such a positive reaction in Glasgow.
Later in the day, Garbage were left bemused at the end of their set after someone appeared to wander onstage from behind the scenes.A visibly annoyed Shirley Manson was heard repeatedly asking - using a number of expletives - who the man was after noticing him apparently setting up gear during the band's closing number of Push It.The singer, draped in tartan, then loudly exclaimed over the microphone before thanking the group's fans, who had watched a set that included hits like Stupid Girl and I'm Only Happy When It Rains.
