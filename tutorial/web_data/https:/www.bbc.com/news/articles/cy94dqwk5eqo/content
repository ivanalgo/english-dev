A developer has defended plans to convert a tower block into flats after a series of objections.Vinovium House in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, could be redeveloped into 54 flats under plans submitted by Amsage Limited.The eight-storey building, at Saddler Street, previously housed a Job Centre Plus and Department for Work and Pensions offices.Several objection letters from nearby residents were submitted to Durham County Council after the plans were announced, with some citing "rumours" the flats could house asylum seekers.
Ian Simpson, who lives nearby, said he feared "an anti-social ghetto could develop in Bishop Auckland" if the proposal was approved, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service.Resident Carrie-ann Hewitt said she was concerned that the flats would not "adequately address" the housing needs of locals, attracting refugees instead.
She added: "The sheer size and design of the building will likely make it an eyesore and detract from the character and aesthetics of our town."The applicant said rumours were being spread over social media that an agreement had already been reached for the building to house refugees.In a statement, they said: "We can confirm no agreement is in place, and no talks have been held with any companies."They added the plan was for the building to provide "much-needed" accommodation for residents while regenerating the town."We hope this puts you all at ease and helps show you that this development is a positive step forward in the regeneration of the area and provides residents of Bishop Auckland and surrounding areas with much-needed residential accommodation in the heart of the town," they said.
