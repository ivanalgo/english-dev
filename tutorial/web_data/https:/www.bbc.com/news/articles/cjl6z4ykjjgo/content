A large shopping centre has been sold to the owners of Sports Direct - who said they were "committed" to reviving high street retail.The Frenchgate Centre in Doncaster has been purchased by Frasers Group for an undisclosed sum.The city centre complex is home to a number of major brands and is connected to the main railway and bus stations.Frasers said the deal was a sign of their confidence in the bricks and mortar retail sector.
Frasers Group chief executive Michael Murray grew up in Doncaster and his father is a local property developer.Frenchgate's previous owner was Irish investor Patrick McKillen. Next, H&M and TK Maxx all have stores in the centre.Mr Murray said: “The acquisition of Frenchgate Centre in Doncaster further demonstrates the group’s commitment to investing in bricks and mortar."Frasers Group said the sale would allow it increase the size of the present Sports Direct store and provide customers with access to other brands including USC and Evans Cycles.Mr Murray added: "We are committed to reinventing retail and injecting new life into high streets across the UK to bring the very best brands, environment, and experience to customers across the country.”The development was originally named the Arndale Centre when it opened in 1968. In 2006, a large extension was built and integrated into a new transport interchange.One of the flagship tenants in the expanded centre was Debenhams, which opened the same year but closed in 2021. A developer's plan to transform the large store into a cinema was approved by Doncaster Council last year.
Doncaster Chamber, which promotes business in the city, said the news was "tremendous".Vice president Jim Carley added: "It’s very, very positive. It’s always great to have new investment into Doncaster and hopefully it’ll create a lot of opportunity for the city centre, in terms of the potential for increases in unit occupancy at the Frenchgate as well as visitor footfall."There are still challenges post-pandemic, people increasingly looking at online shopping, so I think that makes this investment all the more important. But hopefully it all adds diversity, hopefully it’ll have a ripple effect in terms of a wider impact on the city centre that will benefit businesses and retailers alike.”The Grade II-listed Grand Theatre next to the shopping centre is part of the Frenchgate estate, and this month it was announced that the building, which has been derelict for 30 years, will be sold at auction.
