A school broke the law when it used facial recognition technology to take cashless payments from students, the UK's privacy watchdog found.Chelmer Valley High School, in Chelmsford, first started using the technology in its canteen in March 2023.However, it failed to carry out any prior assessment of the risks to the children's information, and infringed data protection law, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said.The Essex-based secondary school, which was reprimanded by the ICO, has been contacted for comment.
The ICO, in an announcement published on Tuesday, said the 1,200-pupil school failed to consult with parents and students fully before implementing the technology.It said a letter was sent to parents in March 2023 with a slip for them to return if they did not want their child to participate.But there was also no option to give consent to the scheme, meaning the school was wrongly relying on assumed approval until November 2023."Most students were old enough to provide their own consent," the ICO added."Therefore, parental opt-out deprived students of the ability to exercise their rights and freedoms."The school was told it must improve how it used data protection impact assessments and was given a set of recommendations.
The report said: "The Information Commissioner (the Commissioner) issues a reprimand to Chelmer Valley High School in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) in respect of certain infringements of the UK GDPR."
Fingerprint based payment systems are widespread in schools, but facial recognition technology used for payments is still uncommon.In 2021 the ICO said schools using facial recognition systems should consider less intrusive ways to let pupils pay for meals.Its remarks followed a decision by a number of schools in North Ayrshire to introduce the tech. The schools subsequently paused their plans.Lynne Currie, head of privacy innovation at the ICO, said introducing facial recognition technology was a decision that "should not be taken lightly"."Handling peopleâ€™s information correctly in a school canteen environment is as important as the handling of the food itself," she said."We expect all organisations to carry out the necessary assessments when deploying a new technology to mitigate any data protection risks and ensure their compliance with data protection laws."
