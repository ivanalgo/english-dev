The father of a teenager who died after he was stabbed on a crowded dance floor at a party has said greater awareness of the dangers of knives could have stopped what happened.Charlie Cosser, 17, from Milford, Surrey, died two days after the attack at the private party in Warnham, West Sussex, last July. His killer, Yura Varybrus, 17, was on Wednesday jailed for life for murder.Martin Cosser, Charlie’s father, told BBC Radio Sussex a knife had been reported by guests at the party, and that it could have been taken seriously with more understanding of the dangers.
He said the family would be focusing on a charity they have set up to tackle knife crime.Charlie’s Promise will help ensure other children would realise the dangers.Charlie was stabbed three times in the chest in a marquee at the party attended by more than 100 people, after a fight broke out.Mr Cosser said: "Regardless of background or upbringing, everybody has a choice, and the night that Charlie was murdered, there were missed opportunities."He said: “This isn’t to make those kids at the party – young kids – feel bad. "We don’t blame them for anything, but the reality is a ‘shank’, [or] a knife, was mentioned several times, and if that had been taken seriously, Charlie may still be alive."And maybe, just maybe, if they’d had someone like me, an organisation like Charlie’s Promise, in their schools at a young age, talking to their kids, they’d have taken that seriously, reported it, and my little boy may still be here today.”
Mr Cosser said work at Charlie’s Promise "will not stop", because it was important for children to realise the dangers and the impact of knife crime.The charity will hold a fun run event, Charlies's Games, on 17 August at Charterhouse School, near Godalming, where Charlie was an apprentice groundsman.
