A council is launching a second round of community orchard funding to celebrate the Coronation of King Charles III.West Oxfordshire District Council said it was now inviting applicants interested in planting their own orchard.The authority was awarded £50,000 from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' (Defra) Coronation Living Heritage Fund.In the first round of the funding, six community groups successfully planted their orchards. 
The groups were Hanborough Manor Church of England School, 1st Wychwoods Scout Group, Shilton Parish Council, Burford Town Council, Clanfield Community Orchard and The Sanctury Community Garden at Carterton Methodist Church.They planted 65 trees, including 28 apple trees, 18 pear trees, six plum trees and five cherry trees.Giles Hughes, chief executive at the council, said it was estimated that "in the last 100 years or so over 80% of them have disappeared across Oxfordshire, with half of those which remain reported to be in poor condition". Mr Hughes added the orchards would bring a variety of benefits such as "building on people’s knowledge and enthusiasm for growing their own food" and "providing vital habitat" for birds, insects and mammals.Jonathan Ayres, deputy group Scout leader for 1st Wychwoods Scout Group, described the abandoned allotment they had been given as "the perfect opportunity" for the children to learn about planting and growing fruit and vegetables.He added that their "mini orchard" would produce fruit "for all to enjoy in future years".The orchards must be publicly accessible, or accessible to a significant number of people, such as in a school.A free webinar hosted by the International Tree Foundation on 19 June will offer guidance around design and maintenance.The closing date for applications is 31 July and successful applicants will be notified in  August.
