The interior items of a Cotswold Manor house, one of which dates back to Roman times, are going under the hammer.The collection from Dunkirk Manor in Nailsworth, Gloucestershire, was amassed by a well-travelled, anonymous, private collector. The highlights up for auction later this month include a Roman marble cinerary urn dating from the 1st Century AD."Our mother’s extraordinary collection seamlessly blends the modern with the antique, which is a reflection of her impeccable taste and deep appreciation for historic and contemporary design," commented her daughter.
"Her passion for antiques blossomed into a career as an antiques dealer, while her own collection remained a deeply personal and ever-expanding endeavour. "She had an eye for French furniture, Asian-inspired pieces, ceramics and eclectic modern art," she added.Among the fine art in the sale is a 19th Century oil painting of Madonna and Child after the revered Italian Renaissance artist Raphael (1483 - 1520).
Chorley's auctioneers, which is selling the collection, said it presented an opportunity to acquire a diverse range of fine and decorative arts, from antiquity to contemporary.Thomas Jenner-Fust, director at Chorley's said: "The interiors at Dunkirk Manor were the culmination of a lifetime of collecting."The overall effect was atmospheric and theatrical, full of colour and eye-catching details, a breath of fresh air in a world full of dull and homogeneous interiors. "It is now time for this collection, that has given so much joy, to be dispersed and go on to enhance other collections and interiors,” he added.
Among the more unusual works is a 19th Century Dutch child's sleigh, with stunning landscape scenes on each side, which carries an estimate of £300-£500.The two-day sale of Fine Art & Antiques takes place on 23 and 24 July at Prinknash Abbey Park.
