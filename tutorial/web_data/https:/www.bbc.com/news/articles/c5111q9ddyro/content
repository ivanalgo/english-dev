Drivers and residents are being warned of overnight road closures and noise due to construction work on a new route in West Sussex.The night works on the A284 are to facilitate the construction of a tie-in to the new Lyminster Bypass, West Sussex County Council (WSCC) said.The A284 will be closed from 20:00 BST on Monday 1 July to 06:00 on Saturday 6 July. Diversions will be in place.WSCC said: "There may be periods of noisy activities within the site working area during these times."
The council said the new Lyminster Bypass would help ease congestion, boost the local economy and provide north-south access from the A27.It said it was responsible for delivering the northern half of the bypass, which would alleviate traffic issues through the village.The bypass will link to the existing A284 from a point approximately 600m (1,968ft) south of the A27 at Crossbush and join the privately developed section of the same proposed bypass at Toddington Nurseries.The wider project would improve safety and accessibility, as well as contribute to regeneration, the council added.The bypass is also linked to the provision of 1,260 new homes and 700 new jobs.It will consist of a single dual carriageway with a verge on one side and a shared footway and cycleway on the other. The council hopes it will encourage more people to walk and cycle.In a public consultation in September 2014, 61% of respondents supported the scheme while 31% opposed it. The remaining nine per cent did not express an opinion, WSCC said.
