A quadruple amputee has been preparing to row for two weeks in an adapted sail boat across the south of England in June. Alex Lewis, 43, from Stockbridge in Hampshire has been training in Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, for his biggest UK sporting challenge yet, and one his 13-year-old will be able to watch and support. He became a quadruple amputee after falling ill in November 2013 with what he thought was "man flu", but contracted Strep A which led to septicaemia, toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis.  "It's just kind of proving a point that you can do it if you meet the right people," he said. 
Dr Geoff Watson has worked in intensive care for 30 years and was part of the team who looked after Mr Lewis whilst he was undergoing treatment. He said: "It's so overused the word inspiration but he does inspire me... if he phones me I know its going to be about doing something crazy... nothing is beyond him."Despite embarking on trips across the world to Greenland and Africa, the Pig 2 Pig challenge will be his first "sizeable" event held in the UK. 
Mr Lewis will be raising money for three charities including the Alex Lewis Trust. He said: "Hospitality Action and the Murray Parish Trust are two charities very close to the hearts of two guys that enabled me to travel and they got me into this adventure setting and I've just caught the bug."He hopes to be able to create better access to prosthetics that work in water and fund equipment for people with disabilities. "We've never seen it done before in the UK... it's just kind of proving a point that you can do it if you meet the right people."I love the adventure, I love the awkwardness, I love the aches and pains the muscle aches, the sores - I just think it's all part of it. I'm very lucky I get to do it."
