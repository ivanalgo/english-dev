A woman and her dog have been rescued after becoming stranded on a rock armour. The woman became stuck at Rhos on Sea, Conwy county, at about 05:15 BST on Sunday morning, when she suffered minor cuts after her dog ran off, the RNLI said. The woman started shouting for help, prompting the lifeboat to locate the pair, who were taken onboard the boat and safely brought to shore."The incoming tide can catch so many people out," the RNLI said. "The woman this morning had noticed she was in trouble, knew that the rock armour that she was on wouldnâ€™t become fully submerged and made the right decision to call for help rather than attempting to self-rescue," it said.
