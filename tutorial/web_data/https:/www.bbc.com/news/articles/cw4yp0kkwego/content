A couple said they have not been able to vote in the general election after their postal ballots failed to arrive before they went on holiday.Peter and Carolyn Beddis, from Sutton Coldfield, said Birmingham City Council told them their ballots would arrive by Friday - three days before they were due to fly out to Pisa, Italy.But the ballot forms had not arrived before the pair left on Monday, leaving them both frustrated, Mr Beddis said.The council said it was not aware of any delays, adding that it was limited as to when postal votes could be sent out because of the short election timetable.
The postal vote process relies on a supply chain of local authorities and printers, which produce the ballot papers before they are given to Royal Mail for delivery.A Royal Mail spokesperson said their service had "no backlog of postal votes". 
Mr Beddis said it was outrageous they were unable to vote, especially as they had registered in good time.The couple registered for postal votes online on 30 May and received confirmation they would be delivered to them by 28 June.He said he called the council on 25 June to make sure they would arrive and was told they would be delivered before they were due to leave."They've let us down very badly. I can't believe we’re the only people in that situation," he said."I’m 71 and I’ve never missed voting in a general election, ever since I was eligible to vote. My wife feels very strongly about this because women died to get her the vote and she's not able to because of their [the council’s] incompetence."
A council spokesperson said postal votes went out in two batches - one was sent out about 21 June and the second about 26 June."We are not aware of any widespread delays in postal votes going out," the spokesperson added."Unfortunately the short election timetable meant that we were limited as to when postal votes could be dispatched, and the law prevents reissues any earlier than Friday 28 June."The council said it could issue replacements to anyone who has not received their postal vote until 17:00 BST on polling day."We have no backlog of postal votes and, whilst we are not complacent, we remain confident that postal votes handed to us on time will be delivered prior to polling day," a Royal Mail spokesperson said. "Where specific concerns have been raised, we have investigated and confirmed ballot packs are being delivered as soon as they arrive in our network."
