An independent investigator found night-time procedures for inmates were followed at the Isle of Man Prison on the night an inmate died, an inquest has heard.Christopher Corkill, 46, was found unresponsive in his cell at the Jurby facility on the morning of 24 February 2023.Karen Wagstaffe, who undertook an independent investigation into the death, told the hearing at Douglas Courthouse Mr Corkill had shown "no signs" he would hurt himself.She said her review had found there were no breaches in prison policies on evening ang night-time checks by officers, who had acted in "good faith".
Under the regime in place at the time, prisoners were checked at about 20:30 BST in their cells, but were not looked in on again individually overnight unless they were classed as vulnerable.However, Ms Wagstaffe said there was a "sense" prison officers had "felt rushed" to return to the normal regime following Mr Corkill's death, and several were "unhappy" that education sessions had continued on the day as normal, as it was "disrespectful".He was the third inmate to be found dead at the prison between March 2020 and February 2023.
The inquest heard Ms Wagstaffe had listened back to phone conversations between the 46-year-old and his partner Lisa Barnett made during the week of his death in which he had said his "mind had been working overtime" as he had not been able to get hold of her.During one of the calls Ms Barnett told him she would be unable to visit him at the prison on their three-year anniversary on 21 February due to work commitments, but would be able to that weekend.The inquest heard Mr Corkill's had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension.However, the 46-year-old's custody support officer, Frazer Campbell, said he had not raised any concerns about his physical or mental health and his demeanour remained the same, which he said was quiet, "easy to get on with" and "always respectful".He would spend a "large portion of the day sleeping", which was "not unusual" for prisoners, Mr Campbell said.The court also heard from fellow prisoner Anthony Lyons, who said Mr Corkill had been his "normal self" the previous evening and his death had come "out of the blue".Tests found traces Mr Corkill's prescription medication in his system, but a police officer who attended the prison after his death had found a mirtizapine tablet in his cell, which he had been prescribed for anxiety.The inquest continues.
