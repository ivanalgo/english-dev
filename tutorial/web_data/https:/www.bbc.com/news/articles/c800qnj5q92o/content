Cheese rolling has made a welcome return to a Cambridgeshire village, with crowds turning out en-masse for the quirky festival.The Stilton Cheese Rolling Festival began in the 1950s but fell by the wayside in 2017 when it was deemed "uncool".Teams in fancy dress and with quirky names competed to be the fastest at rolling a wooden log shaped to look like cheese along a 30m (100ft) course at Stilton Pavilion. The Cool Rollings team retained its title by winning this year's rolling event.
