An extra £4.8m is needed to complete works to regenerate Queens Gardens in Hull.Funding of £12m was announced to make improvements at the city centre park in 2021 but the project is now expected to cost £21.1m in total.Additional costs include more tree planting, rebuilding walls, drainage and hazard removal.Hull City Council's cabinet approved the additional funds at its meeting on Monday.
In 2023, it was decided that the project be split into two phases to help "address urgent structural issues and reduce the impact of ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the construction industry relating to Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic".Both phases cost more than the council first anticipated and interim costings last year put the project at £16.3m.The recommendations to increase the budget were made to cabinet, which supported the increase to "enable improved delivery of the project".When the council announced the refurbishment it said the gardens would create a link between some of the city’s key maritime heritage sites.
