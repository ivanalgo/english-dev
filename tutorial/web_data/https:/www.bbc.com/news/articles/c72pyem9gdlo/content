A couple have admitted dining and dashing to the value of more than £1,000 at five restaurants.CCTV of Bernard McDonagh, 41, and his wife Ann McDonagh, 39, eating meals and failing to pay for them at a Swansea restaurant went viral last month. The couple, from Sandfields, Port Talbot, pleaded guilty to failing to pay restaurant bills between August 2023 and April 2024 at Swansea Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.Ann McDonagh also admitted thefts from two supermarkets as well as one count of obstructing or resisting a police officer.
Newly-opened Bella Ciao, in Swansea, was one of the restaurants targeted by the fraudsters last month.The other counts related to meals at Isabella's in Porthcawl, River House in Swansea Docks, Golden Fortune in Port Talbot and La Casona in Skewen.The total amount in unpaid food and drink bills was £1,168.10.
Giovan Cangelosi and Domenica Perico, who own Bella Ciao, said the family ordered T-bone steaks and double pudding portions, then left without paying their £329 bill."When something like this happens, for us, it's completely destroying," Ms Perico said at the time.Speaking after the hearing, the restaurant manager said they were pleased with the outcome and had had messages of support "from all over the world".And a spokesman for River House said: "We are delighted to hear that justice has, at last, caught up with the pair."The court was told that Bernard and Ann McDonagh, who have three children under 16, both have previous convictions for theft and fraud.They have been released on bail while reports are prepared and will be sentenced on 29 May at Swansea Crown Court.
