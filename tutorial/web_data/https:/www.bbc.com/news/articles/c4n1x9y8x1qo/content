Research and office buildings due to be built on the edge of a village will offer jobs in a growing area, councillors have said.Three buildings are due to be constructed on land off West Way on the edge of Sawston, near Cambridge, after planning permission was approved.The buildings are proposed to offer a flexible use, which means they could be used for research and development, light industry or storage and distribution.The developer said the “high-quality employment buildings” would enable 272 jobs to be created.
The land where the development is proposed had previously been allocated for housing by South Cambridgeshire District Council, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.However, a report presented to the council’s planning committee on Wednesday said there was already permission for a light industrial development there.Councillors highlighted that the area surrounding the site included a range of commercial buildings, and therefore the new development would not be out of place.Heather Williams said she could not see “any real outcry or opposition” to the plan.She said there was “quite a lot of housing” being built, and more developments that could create jobs were “not necessarily a bad thing”.Dr Tumi Hawkins said there was little objection to the development and “massive benefits”.The committee voted unanimously in favour of approving the development.
