Residents have backed council proposals to ban lorries on some country lanes in Surrey.Surrey County Council has asked for views on proposals to stop HGVs driving in some roads in the Waverley and Guildford boroughs - unless they are making deliveries.The consultation follows a request by local parish councils and complaints from residents.The county council said if a potential ban was given the go ahead, it would extend from the A283 Petworth Road and the A3100 Portsmouth Road to the A281 Horsham Road.
The council had also received complaints from residents in Hascombe, Witley, Chiddingfold, Hambledon, Bramley, and Dunsfold.Cranleigh also has roads on the list, and HGVs could be banned in parts of Godalming.Residents' concerns centre on damage to the highway and congestion.Michael Moore, a 74-year-old retired butcher who has lived in Chiddingfold all his life, said: “They should be diverted elsewhere.”
He added that when he was younger, there was very little traffic in the village, particularly heavy traffic."It just grew bigger and bigger and bigger,” he said.Another local resident, Simon Cooke, said: “I’m really happy that they’ve even thought about doing it. "The roads are in such poor condition here and the fewer heavy vehicles we can have driving down these roads can only be a good thing.”HGV driving instructor Gary Stevenson, from Dunsfold Airport-based GS Driver Training, said lorry drivers should avoid “tight country lanes”.The consultation runs until 21 June.
