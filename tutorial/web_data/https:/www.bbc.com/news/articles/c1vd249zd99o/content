Bath City Farm says it needs donations to meet running costs, saying demand for its services "has never been higher".The facility, in Whiteway, offers free services to vulnerable adults, children and people with additional needs.To secure the site's future, bosses are hoping to raise £40,000 after bills increased this year to about £80,000.Director Brendan Tate Wistreich said: “We know it is a challenging time for everyone, but if you like what we do, please consider giving to this campaign to help us sustain our vital community work."
Bosses say the money will pay for staff to manage the site, cover rising energy costs and maintain the 37-acre site for the 50,000 people who visit each year. "You can help us keep this site free for everyone to visit an amazing free resource for the community," said Simon White site development manager.
