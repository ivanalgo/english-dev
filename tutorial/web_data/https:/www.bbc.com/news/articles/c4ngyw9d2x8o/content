Health chiefs have vowed to help improve four GP surgeries in Telford after they scored poorly in a patient satisfaction survey.Teldoc, Wellington, Donnington and Charlton medical practices all received scores lower than 60% in an NHS England report.It showed difficulties patients had with contacting the four surgeries was the main issue, as well as patients not being able to see their preferred GP often enough.NHS Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin said the report was published at a time when high demand was impacting patients’ ability to get an appointment.
Teldoc was bottom of the Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin region on 40.7%, followed by Wellington (50.7%), Donnington (57.1%) and Charlton on 57.4%.Patients were asked a number of questions as part of the exercise, including what their overall experience at practices was like.
Nicola Williams, associate director of primary care at NHS Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin, said practices were delivering more daily appointments than ever before, adding staff were working incredibly hard to cope with increased demand.But she said findings of the survey were clear and that too many patients were waiting too long for an appointment.“We are working hard to make improvements through extensive work to support the national Primary Care Access Recovery Plan and at an individual practice level, yet we know there is still much to be done,” she said.“Our work has spanned improvements to phone systems, online access through the NHS App and practice websites, to make it easier for people to make contact, get an appointment and improve patient satisfaction.”The four surgeries would be providing support via a “quality practice visit”, during which action plans would be put together in a bid to make improvements," Ms Williams said.
