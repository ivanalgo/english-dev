A man who "tortured" his partner during a campaign of domestic abuse has been given a suspended prison sentence.Christopher McManus subjected his girlfriend of 10 years to "physical and emotional abuse", including regularly using "nasty" words which had a "significant impact" upon her, Newcastle Crown Court heard.Things came to a head when he trapped her arm in a door during an argument and she called the police in August 2022.McManus, 34, of Millford in Leam Lane, Gateshead, admitted using coercive and controlling behaviour and assault causing actual bodily harm. He was jailed for 11 months suspended for 18 months.
Prosecutor Joe Hedworth said the couple got together at the age of 21 and at first had a "normal" relationship".But after a few months McManus "appeared to reveal his true colours" and regularly became "angry, aggressive and unpredictable", Mr Hedworth said.He said the victim would "flinch" every time McManus picked up a remote control as he had frequently thrown one at her, which the defendant "found funny" and accused the woman of "over-reacting".Other incidents highlighted by Mr Hedworth included:On 14 August 2022 McManus blocked the door to stop his partner and their young son leaving to go to a family event but she managed to get past.When she returned an argument ensued during which McManus went upstairs to check the woman's phone, Mr Hedworth said.The woman went after him but as she tried to follow him into the bedroom, McManus pushed the door shut against her arm leaving extensive bruising.In a statement read to the court, the woman said McManus had "taken 10 years" of her life, adding he had "tortured" her and subjected her to "physical and mental abuse" yet thought he had "done nothing wrong".
Judge Julie Clemitson said McManus' verbal assaults on the woman were particularly harmful, adding they were "the sort of words that [could] have a devastating affect on a person's wellbeing".She said his comments were "nasty, belittling and hurtful" and "undermined her confidence and self-esteem in a significant way".The judge said it was especially troubling that much of it had happened in front of their young son who had been "absorbing" what was going on and seen his mother in "distress" and his father being "cruel".McManus was ordered to complete 150 hours unpaid work and given a restraining order banning him from contacting his former partner for three years.
