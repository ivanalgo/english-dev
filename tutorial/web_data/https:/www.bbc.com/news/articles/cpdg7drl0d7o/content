The personal data of more than 5,000 islanders was accidentally shared with a member of the public.Human error led to the data - including full names and details of amounts payable - being emailed to an individual, the States of Guernsey said.The data breach was reported to The Office of the Data Protection Authority, which has launched an investigation.The States said it apologised for the lapse in security, would fully cooperate with the investigation and was working to improve its systems.
It said no medical records or details of procedures were included, and insufficient data was shared that would enable someone to utilise that data for the purposes of identity fraud.The States said when the error was discovered, steps were taken to recover the email and it confirmed with the recipient that they permanently deleted the email.However, it said those who have used the island's health services, or members of the public, had concerns they could contact the States Data Protection Team.
