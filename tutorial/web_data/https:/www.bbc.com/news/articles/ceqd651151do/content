Work has started on a new £91m hospital building in Bournemouth that will increase patient capacity in the region.The latest project at Royal Bournemouth Hospital is part of a £500m transformation of University Hospital Dorset (UHD) sites.The four-floor, 10,800sqm building will house four levels of new hospital wards, totalling 110 beds.It is due for completion in winter 2025.
Construction on the ward block begins as the nearby BEACH building - housing the maternity unit, children's unit and emergency department - nears completion.Dr Robin O’Gorman, UHD medical care group's medical director, said: "We are absolutely delighted to see this project under way. "Patients will benefit from new ward spaces, with the majority being single rooms.
