Building work on a new hotel on the Lincolnshire coast has begun, a developer has said. A new 80-bed Travelodge and Starbucks is being built on the site of the former crazy golf course on South Parade in Skegness.Developer The Burney Group said construction is due to finish next year with the hotel expected to open for the summer holiday season.The land, which had been valued at £280,000 was sold by East Lindsey District Council for one pound in April.
At the time of the sale, Councillor Steve Kirk told the BBC the site had been "underused for many years" and the situation was a "win-win for everybody".In January 2023, The Burney Group was granted planning permission to build a six-storey hotel and drive-through coffee shop on the site. It will also include a top floor bar and restuarant.Daren Burney, the group's managing director, said the start of the construction work is a "major development"."I'm hoping this will be the catalyst for regeneration in that part of the seafront. That's the vision and I hope we can drive forward lots of local, year-round jobs."It always makes good headlines about getting land for a pound but we're putting in a considerable amount of money that's in excess of £10 million. I'm glad we're finally on site," he said.The Burney Group said it hopes to hand the drive-through over to Starbucks in February and the hotel to Travelodge in June 2025.
