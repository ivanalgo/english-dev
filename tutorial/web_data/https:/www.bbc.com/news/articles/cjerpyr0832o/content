Dreamland in Margate will have to meet a series of safety conditions after concerns were raised following the death of a teenager during a drum and bass event.Thanet District Council’s licensing sub-committee agreed the venue could continue to hold events, with amended conditions, after Kent Police requested a review of its licence.It follows the death of 17-year-old Emily Stokes during a Worried About Henry gig, which also saw a further 21 people fall ill from suspected drugs overdoses, on 29 June.Dreamland said it remained committed to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all its visitors and was continuing to assist police with their investigation.
An application by Kent Police for the licence review revealed how the force declared a major incident after a number of people under 18 were taken to hospital, with the youngest aged 15.
After Wednesday’s meeting, Thanet council said the sub-committee had been presented with conditions agreed by Kent Police, Dreamland and the authority.Those conditions included that the venue holds a monthly safety advisory group meeting, follows risk assessment procedures, shares a copy of its drug policy with police and restricts high-risk events to people over 18.Conditions also stated that all security and stewarding staff receive full training on their duties and relevant staff are trained in age verification.Qualified paramedics and trained emergency staff are to be on site at every outdoor music event and any high-risk indoor music events, documents said.A further condition said sound management reports must also be made available to environmental health.A spokesman for the authority said councillors agreed to amend the licence to include all agreed conditions and added a further condition that event management must also cover boundary security at the venue.
A statement issued by Dreamland said: "Our thoughts and prayers remain with Emily Stokes’ family and friends."Dreamland works closely with Thanet District Council and the emergency services when planning our events and we remain committed to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all our visitors."We will continue to assist the police with their investigation."Thanet council said the full decision would be published on its website.
