An increase in scam emails is behind a fresh warning for people in Guernsey.The Office of the Data Protection Authority (ODPA) said it had seen a surge in phishing activity that had compromised emails from the island.Phishing is when fraudsters send scam emails or text messages containing links to websites that either access systems or trick users into revealing sensitive information and transfer money.The ODPA urged people to not click on any links in potential scam emails and to contact them immediately if they have been targeted.
A public advisory message issued by the ODPA said there are several steps people can take to protect themselves from phishing scams.These include making sure people know what to look out for, verifying suspicious emails with the sender and implementing security measures such as multi-factor authentication.A spokesperson said: "The ODPA is warning islanders to exercise extreme caution when receiving emails containing links and attachments."It comes after the ODPA received several breach notifications relating to the compromise of email accounts."If you receive any suspicious e-mails, please do not click on any attached links or documents."In May, the ODPA said more than 1,500 people in Guernsey had been affected by personal data breaches in the first quarter of this year.
