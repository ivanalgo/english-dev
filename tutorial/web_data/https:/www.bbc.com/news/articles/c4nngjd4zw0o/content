A school in Surrey has been given the lowest possible rating by Ofsted after inspectors found offensive language among pupils had become “normalised”.Sunbury Manor School was previously rated 'good' following a previous inspection in 2019.But a new report found the use of racist and homophobic language had become normalised between pupils, leading to a rating of 'inadequate' in all areas.The school’s new headteacher, David Lee, said: “The report is not where we are, not who we are and not what we want to be identified as.”
In 2019, inspectors found the school to be inclusive and respectful, but there has since been a “sharp decline” in standards.The latest report said prejudicial language had become the norm, and this had “allowed a culture of racist and homophobic ‘banter’ to develop”.“Many say that they would not report this behaviour because they are not confident it will be dealt with effectively. They are justified in feeling this way," the inspector said.Inspectors also highlighted a high rate of absence among students.There was also a high staff turnover, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.Mr Lee, who started in his role last week, said he was focused on “moving forward” and “doing everything" to bring improvements.
