There is no direct evidence that a man accused of murdering a woman for her jewellery killed her, a judge has told jurors.Andrew Hall, 46, denies murdering Glenna Siviter, 50, at her home in Middlesbrough in December.Ms Siviter had been stabbed 36 times and her body lay hidden beneath a sofa for four days, Newcastle Crown Court heard.Giving his legal directions to jurors, Judge Mr Justice Nicholas Lavender said there were 12 pieces of "circumstantial" evidence which prosecutors claimed showed Mr Hall's guilt, but the defendant said were unreliable.
Prosecutors claim Ms Siviter was killed at her home in Grimwood Avenue sometime between 03:00 GMT and 13:20 on 11 December, with her body found in her living room four days later by her adult son.It is alleged Mr Hall, who was a childhood friend of Ms Siviter and said to be like a "brother" to her, killed her to steal her jewellery to sell for drugs.After he declined to give evidence at his trial, the judge provided legal directions to the jury.Mr Justice Lavender said there was "no direct evidence Mr Hall killed Ms Siviter", such as a witness or camera footage, so the crown "relied on circumstantial evidence".
He said that included:
The judge said Mr Hall would respond by saying there were "too many gaps and unanswered questions" in the prosecution's case, including:
The judge said it was up to jurors to decide "which pieces of evidence were reliable" and it was for the prosecution to make them "sure" Mr Hall was guilty.Mr Hall declined to give evidence and the judge said that was his "perfect right" as it was for the prosecution to prove their case.But, the judge said, jurors were "open to conclude the reason he remained silent" was he had "no answer to the [prosecution's] case or none that would stand up to examination".
In his closing speech to jurors, prosecutor Peter Moulson KC said robbery appeared to be the motive for the killing and because her alleged killer was known to Ms Siviter, they had to kill her to stop her identifying them to police.He said the 36 stab wounds to her head, neck and body could "leave no room" for any intention other than to "kill".He said Mr Hall would have known Ms Siviter would "welcome him in" whenever he visited and there was "no sign of forced entry" at her home.Mr Moulson said there had been "not one word" from Mr Hall about the allegations and his silence was significant, adding the evidence called for an "explanation" from the defendant.Mr Hall, of Thorntree Avenue in Middlesbrough, also denies the attempted murder of two men in stabbings in the days between Ms Siviter's death and the discovery of her body.The trial continues.
