Rail travellers and tourism groups are calling for the reinstatement of a direct rail service from Kent to Gatwick Airport which was scrapped more than 15 years ago.The direct service between Tonbridge and the Sussex airport was stopped in 2008 when the route was incorporated into the franchise now operated by Southern Railway.Tourism group Visit Kent said the service's return would be "really good news for inbound tourism". A Network Rail spokesperson said that while no new service is planned "in the short-to-medium term", it would "continue to liaise with partners about the options to improve connectivity between Gatwick and Kent".
A Network Rail report, released in March, summarised there was a case for direct trains to be reintroduced but some commentators questioned whether there would be space for them on the Brighton mainline.Since 2008 Gatwick-bound rail passengers from Kent have had to change trains at Redhill.Natalie Lawrence, an assistant head teacher from Tonbridge, wants the service back. She said: "Currently I do not like waiting at Redhill as it’s a bit of a dead station. "In the daytime it is fine, but coming back in the evening I don’t like it. "Tonbridge is a safe station and as a single woman travelling it would be much better to have that connection from Tonbridge.”
Deirdre Wells, from Visit Kent, said: "We are already working with Gatwick on encouraging more visitors to explore the area rather than head straight into London."We are doing a huge amount to promote sustainable tourism and getting more people to travel by train is critical."
