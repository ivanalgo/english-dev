The M25 will partially close overnight on Saturday as a Â£317m junction upgrade continues.National Highways said the motorway would close fully westbound between junctions 9 and 10, including Cobham services.The closure will be in place between 21:00 BST on Saturday and 9:00 on Sunday.While the eastbound carriageway will also be closed during this time, drivers will exit at the slip road and use the roundabout and entry slip road to rejoin the M25.
Diversions are in place for westbound, clockwise users going via the A217, A240 and the A3, with a separate route in place for overheight vehicles.A three-year project, due for completion in summer 2025, is underway to upgrade the junction where the M25 and the A3 meet.Two full weekend closures in March and May were the first of five due to take place this year.National Highways said the next one, to demolish three bridges and install three new ones, would happen before autumn.The date has not yet been confirmed.
