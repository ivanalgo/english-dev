Farmers on the Isle of Man should not be "penalised for the misfortune of losing stock", a union representing the industry has said.The Department of Infrastructure increased costs for the disposal of fallen stock from July, with the price for the collection of a bull jumping by 185% to £152.70.In a statement the government said the animal waste processing plant prices had not increased "for some time" and the rise was "considered an appropriate measure".But Manx National Farmers' Union secretary Sarah Comish it was "unfair and unrealistic" to ask farmers to cover the cost of the plant's operation.
It said the plant was "integral" to the industry but had produced an "average annual net loss of just under £500,000 over the past five years".However, the statement said it was acknowledged the proposed increases had "caused concern", and the government was "committed to continuing to engage" with union on the issue, he said.
The infrastructure department animal waste section holds an exclusive contract to collect and dispose of dead animals from Manx farms.Under the revised pricing structure, the charge for the collection of a bull has risen by £99.15, while the retrieval of a cow has gone up by £60.13.Ms Comish said the hikes would be "catastrophic" for farmers, who were now withholding payments in protest. The extra charges would put an "enormous amount of strain" on the industry and could lead to people choosing to leave it.She said the union had presented alternatives of inflationary increases or a change of regulation to allow farmers to bury carcases on their farms.The union hoped for more discussions, supported by the Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture, could now take place to find a solution with the Department of Infrastructure, she added.
