A senior official at a teaching union has called for the end of "rip-off prices" experienced by families trying to go away during school holidays. Niamh Sweeney, Cambridge-based deputy general secretary of the National Education Union, said price hikes were "unfair", but it was important not to disrupt children's education.Parents will soon be fined £80 per child if they take them on holiday during term-time, but some parents have told the BBC it is a risk they are willing to take.The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) blamed "supply and demand" and encouraged families "to book early to get the best deals".
Ms Sweeny said: "It's so unfair, sometimes you see them double... if they evened it out a bit that would make a hell of a lot of difference."One family told the BBC taking their children away during term-time saved them £3,000 on their family holiday and was worth the £240 school fine.Travel agent John Lombari, based in Royston, Hertfordshire, blamed the high cost of airfares for recent rises.An ABTA spokesperson said prices were "governed by supply and demand". "School holidays fall at already busy times of the year when demand is high... most of Europe takes a break in the summer, especially August, which puts further pressure on prices," they said. "We would encourage families to book early to get the best deals and consider a package holiday, as tour operators will often offer discounted child fares and free child places."
