A collection of 1,600 vintage comics found during a house clearance could sell for up to £5,000, an auction house has estimated.The comics, mostly Marvel and largely dating back to the 1960s, were discovered in the loft of a house in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands.Auctioneers have described the find - which includes the likes of Spider-Man, Captain America and The Hulk - as one of the best collections of vintage comics they have seen in years.The collection will go under the hammer in Lichfield, Staffordshire, on 25 March.
Auctioneer Richard Winterton said the discovery had thrilled his company's comics department.“It was then up to the team to go through them all and check every single one, not just the condition but for first appearances of characters and other aspects which can hugely affect the value."Every box contained at least a few real standouts, he added.The collection is expected to sell for between £3,000 and £5,000.
