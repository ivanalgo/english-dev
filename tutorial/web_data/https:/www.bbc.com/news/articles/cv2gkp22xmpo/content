A recruitment hub has been created to help fill an urgent need for foster carers.The Regional Fostering Recruitment and Retention Hub has been designed to make it easier for those wishing to become a foster carer in Cumbria and Lancashire.It will provide potential carers with help throughout the application process while giving additional assistance to existing families.Cumberland councillor Emma Williamson said the hub would provide "unified support" for anyone considering fostering.
The hub has been created as part of a Â£1.2m joint bid between Blackburn with Darwen Council, Blackpool Council, Cumberland Council, Westmorland and Furness Council, and Lancashire County Council.The five local authorities have created Foster With Us, which will be based at the hub and acts as a first point of contact for those wishing to become a foster carer.Ms Williamson said: "Foster With Us has been launched to provide crucial support to prospective carers when they need it most and to get the word out across our region that sharing your home can shape a child's future for the better."
In north-west England, 760 additional carers are needed to meet the record number of children entering the care system. Across the five local authorities there are 152 children waiting for foster homes, including 19 sibling groups who do not wish to be separated.Councillor Sue Sanderson, cabinet member for children's services at Westmorland and Furness Council, said families from all walks of life were welcome to apply to become foster carers. "The new hub makes it easier than ever for people to find out more about becoming a foster carer in their local area," she added.
The councils said existing carers would also benefit from the launch of the Mockingbird system. The model brings together up to 10 satellite foster families, who will be supported by a specially recruited and trained foster carer.The network has been designed to create a community of foster carers and young people in care.
