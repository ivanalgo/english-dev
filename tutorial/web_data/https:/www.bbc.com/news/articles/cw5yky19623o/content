There has been outrage in Italy after a female tourist in Florence was pictured miming a lewd act on a statue of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and excess.In the photos - which were shared online by the social media account Welcome To Florence - the woman can also be seen kissing the life-size statue at night-time.The Bacchus stands on a plinth on a street corner near the famous Ponte Vecchio bridge and is a modern replica of the 16th Century work by sculptor Giambologna. The original is kept in the nearby Bargello museum.The photos sparked angry reactions from social media users, some of whom called for the woman's arrest."This is the result of years of attempts at turning Florence into Disneyland," said another.Patrizia Asproni, the president of Confcultura, an association that promotes Italy's cultural heritage, told Italian media that these "repeated shows of rudeness and barbarity" take place "because everyone feels entitled to do whatever they want with impunity".Ms Asproni called for the application of the "Singapore model" with "tight checks, sky-high fines and zero tolerance" for bad behaviour.Antonella Rinaldi, Florence's archaeology and fine arts superintendent, said: "Tourists are welcome here but they need to respect our artworks, be they originals or replicas.""Although I doubt this lady - whom I condemn - even knows the difference," she added.Florence is one of the world's foremost tourist destinations. In 2023, around 1.5 million people visited the city - which has a population of just 382,000 - between June and September.Local residents have long struggled with the huge influx of tourists, which in the summer months turns Florence's narrow streets into steady streams of people. The so-called "overtourism" phenomenon has prompted several cities around the world to make changes to the way they welcome tourists. Last month, the mayor of Barcelona pledged to eliminate short-term tourist lets in the city within five years, while several hotspots - like Venice or Japan's Mount Fuji - have started to introduce daily charges to try to limit numbers.
