The creator of a petition which calls for a sports hall and cultural venue to be included in plans for a rebuilt leisure centre is set to address councillors.Liam Shepard has gained 1,700 signatures on his petition relating to the Oasis Centre, which has been closed since late 2020.He is urging Swindon Borough Council, which owns the land the leisure sits on, to insist that developer Seven Capital includes the features in its plans.Mr Shepard will present his petition to the council at a meeting on Thursday.
Mr Shepard said: "I have seen first-hand how this facility has served as more than just a swimming pool.“It has been a hub for community activities ranging from badminton and tennis to boxing and wrestling matches.“It has hosted music festivals, concerts, shows and performances that have brought joy to many.“The proposed revamp by Seven Capital threatens to erase this well-loved history unless we demand that they include plans for a new super modern sports hall.”
Seven Capital has about 90 years to run on a lease on the building and site, and is the de facto owner of the Oasis, which needs a multi-million pound refurbishment before it can reopen.The company has not yet lodged an application for planning permission. The dome and pool area are listed and would need to be kept in any design for the rebuilt centre, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.Seven Capital and the council administration have repeatedly said that possible operators of the new centre are not interested in taking it on as a going concern with a sports hall.
