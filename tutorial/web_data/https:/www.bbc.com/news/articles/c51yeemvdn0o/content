A volunteer police officer who had to learn to walk again after suffering a serious injury while chasing a suspect has returned to duty. Special Sgt Wayne Cliff detached his quadricep muscles and tendons from both knees and required emergency surgery in 2023. The 33-year veteran spent eight days on a trauma ward, was left bedbound for four months, and had to learn to walk again.Nearly 17 months later, he has retuned to work and has been given a King’s Coronation medal, honouring his "commitment and dedication" to the force. 
Despite undergoing a program of intense rehab and physiotherapy, he hopes to return to frontline policing later this year. 
“Yes, I’ve recently had a serious injury on duty, but that’s part and parcel of it," he said. "But that’s made me want to come back."Having volunteered for 33 years and doing something that you’ve always enjoyed, working with people, and giving back to the community. "I think if I stop that, that’s a big part of my life that I’ve lost.“I’m very mindful of the impact on my family, but they are so supportive of me, and I wouldn’t be doing this today if they weren’t supportive.”The awards ceremony recognised almost 50 officers who have displayed unwavering loyalty and professionalism throughout their service with the force.“Being awarded the King’s Coronation medal is a fantastic achievement to receive," he added.Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
