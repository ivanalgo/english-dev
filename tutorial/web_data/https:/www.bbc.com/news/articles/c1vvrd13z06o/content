The sign of Ronnie Barker's antique shop has been sold for £1,430 in an online auction.The late comedian was passionate about collectables and opened The Emporium in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, in 1989 with his wife Joy.Ewbank's Auctions confirmed the sign had gone to a private buyer who grew up in the town.Auctioneer and partner at Ewbank's, Andrew Ewbank, said it was "wonderful" the item had been purchased by someone "with a strong connection to the local area".
The sign had been previously sold in an auction at an Oxfordshire hotel.Mr Ewbank said it had not attracted much attention as the sale had taken place "before online bidding was the norm".But he said this time around there had been "strong competitive bidding online and in the room".The successful purchaser is currently living in the south of the country who grew up in Chipping Norton. "His mother, who lives locally, still recalls many visits to Ronnie Barker’s Antique Shop The Emporium in the 1990s," Mr Ewbank said."It is wonderful that this item has been purchased by someone with a strong connection to the local area, and for this special item to have found a new home after all of these years."The Emporium used to be situated on Chipping Norton's High Street in a unit now occupied by health shop Oats.
Barker's family moved to Oxford from Bedford and bought the house at 23 Church Cowley Road in 1935 when Ronnie was five. He lived there until 1949.The Porridge and Two Ronnies star's first job after leaving school in the city was clerking at the Westminster Bank in Cowley.He later moved to Aylesbury and died in 2005, aged 76.
