A council has agreed to move forward with a major walking and cycling scheme that will stretch over several miles between two towns, despite some objections.On Monday, Wirral Council's environment and transport committee backed a move to press on with a Birkenhead to Liscard route and develop a case for funding from the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. Councillors from Labour, the Green Party and Liberal Democrats said the scheme would make it easier and more accessible for people to walk and cycle between the two town centres.However, the move was opposed by the committee’s three Conservative councillors who said it could become "another white elephant where no one will use it".
The scheme, which is currently projected to cost about £10m, is based on dated projections for original £18m plans to extend the route to New Brighton and Wallasey Village. Funding is expected to be covered by active travel grants awarded to the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, which have been earmarked for improvements to walking and cycling routes.
Labour councillors who spoke in favour of the scheme said it was "a golden opportunity" and would be about "building the infrastructure for the future".Gill Wood said the project was about connectivity and would "positively improve lives"."This change is about thinking about the long term health benefits for future generations," she added.However, Conservative councillor Vida Wilson said it was "going to take a lot of the highway away"."We’re going to end up with more traffic congestion and who’s going to use it?," she added.The three Conservatives on the committee ultimately voted against moving the proposals forward, but it carried after the other members voted in favour.The council said there would be further consultation on any changes made to the scheme and the Royal National Institute of Blind People would be involved going forward.
