Thieves are using recovery trucks to steal uninsured and untaxed cars, according to the police.Cleveland Police said 12 vehicles have been stolen using the recovery trucks in the last six months.The force said it believes the vehicles are then taken to so-called "chop shops", where they are dismantled for parts or sold for scrap.An operation was launched last week to clamp down on the thefts and three men were arrested on suspicion of conspiring to steal motor vehicles.
Cars, vans and caravans have all been stolen using recovery vehicles, with some taken from driveways.Last week, Cleveland Police set up a checkpoint on the outskirts of Markse and several recovery vehicles were stopped by officers.The checkpoint resulted in three men - aged 28, 45, and 68 - being arrested on suspicion of conspiring to steal motor vehicles. They have been bailed pending further enquiries.
Four of the trucks stopped were sent to a Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) checkpoint due to concerns about their condition.All four had defects that needed to be immediately fixed.Officers also seized a suspected stolen car. The force is now working to find out who owns the vehicle.
