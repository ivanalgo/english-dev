A man from Cornwall is calling for the next government to back greener fuels by removing VAT.Steve Inglis, who lives near Liskeard in the constituency of South East Cornwall, said he wanted to convert his old oil fired heating system to run on a green alternative such as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO).He was among the many people who got in touch with the BBC via Your Voice, Your Vote to highlight the issue of affordable and sustainable fuel ahead of next week's general election.Mr Inglis said: "I would like the government, or whoever it is that comes in, to scrap the VAT on HVO to allow us to make it an affordable alternative."
The government said using HVO could eliminate up to 90% of net carbon dioxide (CO2) by significantly reducing nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions.Mr Inglis said he did not have access to mains gas due to the rural setting of his home and was reliant on solar panels and his oil fire burner, which he said was coming to the end of its life.He is now looking to spend Â£500 to convert his existing boiler to run on HVO, which he said was substantially cheaper than heat pump alternatives."It offers a good solution, it is not adding to global warming and it is a good solution to particular properties," he said.
Labour's South East Cornwall candidate Anna Gelderd said she would meet with Mr Inglis to understand the proposal."A Labour government will make people better off, implement an energy transition by setting up GB Energy and put fiscal responsibility at the heart of our plan for the country," she said.The Conservative candidate for South East Cornwall Sheryll Murray said: "I am happy to look at VAT because clearly, I have met lots of struggling families in South East Cornwall and I know how hard it is for people when they do not have mains gas or any alternative to oil."Liberal Democrat candidate for South East Cornwall Colin Martin acknowledged fuel prices had always been a problem for rural households.He said HVO was not a long-term solution but it "could be a good transition fuel" and reducing VAT on bio fuels "could be a good way forward".The BBC has contacted the other candidates in the seat including:
