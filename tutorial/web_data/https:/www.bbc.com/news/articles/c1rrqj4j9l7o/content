Seven more college strikes are to go ahead after talks failed to solve a pay row.Hundreds of college lecturers across Scotland went on strike on Thursday for the second time this week.The EIS Fela union said "no real progress" was made at talks with employers.The dispute stems from a pay rise lecturers should have received in 2022. Colleges are offering lecturers a three year deal worth £5,000.
The EIS Fela union believes lecturers are not getting as good a deal as other public sector workers and fears colleges will need to cut jobs and services to pay for it.It recently submitted a revised four year pay claim.EIS general secretary Andrea Bradley said College Employers Scotland (CES) are not approaching the negotiation "with the commitment and sense of urgency that is needed to bring this dispute to an end".She added: "It is quite outrageous that CES and its members continue to act with such flagrant disregard for fair work, for the people that they employ and for the unions that represent them."The union started a programme of national strikes on Monday. But there had been regular action at many strikes since March.Earlier this week the CES described the strike action as "bewildering" and that it would "cost individual lecturers over £1,000."It said that there would not be an improved pay offer.
