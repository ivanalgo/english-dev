A man who had a "violent scuffle" with his partner, which involved a knife and left her injured, has been given a 22-month jail term.Carlisle Crown Court heard how an argument erupted between Brian Harold, 42, and his now ex-girlfriend over a can of drink.The woman later told police she had been "petrified" and that Harold had "flipped" in a manner she had never previously seen.Judge Michael Fanning heard Harold, previously of Silloth Street, Carlisle, had an extensive criminal record covering 28 years and 113 offences.
A knife, which had earlier been used to prepare illegal substances taken by the pair, was brandished during the row at the victim's home.Both were heavily under the influence of drink and drugs, the court heard. The woman suffered cuts to her head and hand and barricaded herself in a toilet to call the police. Harold, who also suffered facial injuries, was initially charged with unlawful wounding but pleaded guilty to a lesser alternative charge of affray.
During his sentencing hearing, the court heard he regretted the fight and his part in it.Jailing him, the judge also banned Harold from having any contact with the woman for three years.
