A man murdered a pub manager with a fierce blow to the head from a metal bat, a court was told.Adrian Whiting, 35, died in hospital 10 days after the alleged attack outside the Carpenters Arms in Witham Street, Boston on 14 January.Maksim Iliev, also 35, of Union Street, Boston, denies murder and a second charge of manslaughter relating to Mr Whiting's death.Mr Iliev's long-term partner, Katya Tsoneva, 34, of Red Lion Street, Boston, denies a charge of assisting an offender between 13 January and 25 January.
Lincoln Crown Court heard Mr Whiting collected the metal bat and went to the front door of the pub after Mr Iliev was heard "screaming" in the street with Ms Tsoneva.Jonathan Cox, prosecuting, said CCTV then showed Mr Iliev taking the metal bat from Mr Whiting and striking him twice.Mr Cox told jurors: "The second blow, in particular, aimed and landed to the head of Adrian Whiting."The blow, say the prosecution, was fierce. It caused Adrian Whiting to collapse and fall to the floor."Mr Whiting never recovered from the injury sustained in that attack. Despite the best efforts of medical professionals he died 10 days later."The prosecution allege Ms Tsoneva did a number of things in the minutes and hours after the attack to help Mr Iliev try to escape justice.Mr Cox suggested Ms Tsoneva returned to an address which she shared with Mr Iliev to pack items for him, and then used cash and jewellery to pay for a flight out of the UK.The trial continues.
