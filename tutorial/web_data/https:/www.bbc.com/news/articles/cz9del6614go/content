A fire which tore through an abandoned school building, previously used as a cannabis farm, has reignited a week later.Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service was called to Penwalle Road in Llandysul, Ceredigion, at about 20:53 BST on Thursday.Crews from Llandysul and Newcastle Emlyn tackled the small blaze, which was caused by smouldering embers from a destructive fire which caused the roof to collapse on 17 July.Firefighters used a hose reel jet to dampen it down, before leaving the scene at 21:50 BST.
Two men pleaded guilty on 9 July to drugs charges after cannabis plants worth up to Â£2m were found growing in the former school.Police found about 1,500 cannabis plants in various stages of growth across two floors on 4 July.
