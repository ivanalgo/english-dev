An air ambulance charity has raised £1m in six weeks to buy a second rescue helicopter outright.The vehicle based in Redhill, Surrey, was previously leased by the Air Ambulance Charity Kent Surrey Sussex (KSS).David Welch, KSS chief executive told BBC Radio Surrey buying the helicopter will save almost £500,000 a year.He said they will be able to fly for six extra hours every day, fly in more challenging weather conditions and save more lives.
Mr Welch said the fundraiser received an "unbelievable response" and he thought it would take a "little bit longer" to hit the target.He said they received "hundreds and hundreds" of messages expressing gratitude for the work they do.He said: “It has blown us all away and we have been so inspired by the levels of support."To achieve what we have achieved in such a short space of time just shows the incredible generosity of the community." The fundraiser is expected to raise even more than £1m, which Mr Welch said "is even more incredible". The money saved will also go towards KSS's plans to develop its patient and family aftercare service and education programmes. People can have their name or the name of a loved one on the helicopter for a donation of £100 until 28 June. Mr Welch said: “Thank you from the bottom of my heart on behalf of everyone at KSS and behalf of all our patients thank you, it’s just been absolutely incredible."
