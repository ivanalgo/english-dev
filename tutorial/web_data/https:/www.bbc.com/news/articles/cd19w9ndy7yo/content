Councillor Nick Holder said: “We apologise for any inconvenience caused by these works, but this will improve the quality of the parking bays, as well as provide easier access for people with disabilities.“We understand the needs of all our communities, and the differences between them, which is why this upgrade will provide people with more choice on how they want to pay, as well as making them more accessible," he added.The rest of the parking machines, which are compliant with the Equality Act 2010, will be installed over the next couple of months.
