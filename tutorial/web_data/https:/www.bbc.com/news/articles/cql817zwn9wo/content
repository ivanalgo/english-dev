The court was told of two charges related to Jeanes attacking his wife with a baseball bat and broom.One another occasion, Jeanes submerged her head under the water and she feared she was going to drown.Avon and Somerset Police said she sustained bruising during the attacks and a cut on her forehead, which resulted in a permanent scar.Speaking about the impact of the abuse on her life his wife, who did not want her name released, said: “I think the biggest thing for me, that broke my heart, was constantly hearing my mum tell me she was waiting for a phone call from the police, saying I’d been murdered.”
The force said the abuse has had a significant impact on the victim's wellbeing, and she finds it difficult to trust anybody now.Officer in the case, DC Jessica Bennett, said: “Jeanes’ brutal assaults and controlling behaviour didn’t just make her life a misery, it made her actually fear for her life.“We work closely with other agencies so we can help keep victims of domestic abuse safe. "We will investigate all reports to try to bring the perpetrator to justice.“But if any victim does not feel in a position to contact the police, please report it to Next Link or the National Domestic Abuse Helpline who will be able to provide you with support initially and advice.”
