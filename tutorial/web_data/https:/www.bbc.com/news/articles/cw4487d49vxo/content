A group of women have come together in Hornsea as part of a plan to yarn bomb an entire building. Volunteers at the National Coastwatch Institute and the Hornsea Dolphins swimming group have together created 4000 individual blooms for an art installation.Over the long winter months members of the Hornsea Dolphins wild swimming group came together to crochet instead of swim.The panels of flowers will be used to cover the Coastwatch station on Hornsea Promenade as part of the town's open gardens event on Sunday.
Caroline North said the crafting was a distraction when the weather was too rough to swim. She added: "It was just something to do because the sea wasn't being very kind. The waves were too high to get in safely and this opportunity came up so we just threw ourselves into it."
Elaine Thompson from the NCI has helped to bring the project together even though she had never picked up a crochet hook before this year.She said: "I've made a lot of friends, I didn't know any of these ladies when I first started coming for crocheting and I've been made really welcome."
Hornsea Open Gardens is on 16 June and the full installation will be in place at the National Coastwatch Institute look out station on Hornsea Promenade all weekend.
