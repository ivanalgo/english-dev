We believe she died of a broken heart after 20 years of carrying this heartache, and losing her one and only beloved son."In recent years, my father’s health has deteriorated as a result of the grief of Kevin’s death, and all we ask for is for someone to find it within themselves to come forward and speak out about his murder."She said it would help them "begin the grieving process instead of living with this overwhelming anger and heartache".Peter Beirne, head of Thames Valley Police’s major crime investigation review team, said officers wanted to speak to anyone who was staying at The Cricketers, or had information on anyone staying there, on 24 June 2004.Information passed directly on to Crimestoppers will qualify for the reward.Mick Duthie, director of operations at the charity, said: "We hope someone knows who was responsible for this senseless and vicious attack.
