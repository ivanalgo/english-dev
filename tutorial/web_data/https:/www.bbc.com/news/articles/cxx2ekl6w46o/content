A disabled woman has told of the "battle" she has experienced to get issues fixed in her council house as a charity warns of a "housing repair crisis" in the south west of England.Sarah Lambert, 45, who lives in supported housing provided by East Devon District Council (EDDC), said she had been waiting nearly two years for urgent repairs to be undertaken.The Exmouth resident said "it rains inside the bedroom" and mould and damp issues had become so bad her live-in carer was unable to stay with her.EDDC said it "works hard to ensure all repair issues are acted upon in a timely manner".
Ms Lambert moved into the council home in October 2022 and felt as if she had "won the lottery".She said she knew there were issues to be resolved, but had no idea it would take so long to fix them.The resident said her live-in carer for the last 13 years had been unable to use her bedroom in the house and had to live nearby because of mould and damp issues."It rains inside the bedroom through the plaster above the windows," she said.A catalogue of other issues - which she said also included asbestos floors in the bedrooms and windows which did not fit properly - had been reported to the council on numerous occasions.She said the armrest of her wheelchair had been replaced four times due to damage caused by a narrow main entrance door into her bungalow.
Wailim Wong, from Citizens Advice East Devon, said his organisation had spoken to EDDC about Ms Lambert's case.He said he had been assured the council knew about the issues and it was working to resolve it. "It's an absolutely appalling situation," he said.He said the charity was seeing increased numbers of people ask for help resolving property repair and maintenance issues."We talk a lot in the South West about the housing crisis, but there is also a housing repair crisis in the region," he said.
The tenant said other nearby residents were living in the same conditions in council-supported accommodation."There is a reason we are in these supported properties and yet we are treated with disdain and disrespect," she said."Every time we put in reports we're just brushed off."You can speak to any of the residents here and we all have the stories of years of battling to try to get something."
EDDC said it was not able to comment on individual cases but it "works hard to ensure all repair issues are acted upon in a timely manner".It said: "If one of our tenants feels that this has not happened, they are encouraged to submit a complaint to the council, and we will work with the tenant to ensure this is resolved."
