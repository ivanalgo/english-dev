A city train station has reopened its southern side following a multimillion-pound revamp.Work on the £5.5m improvements to Southampton Central Station began in early 2023.The project was paid for using £1.3m from South Western Railway (SWR) alongside government funding.An opening celebration organised by Southampton City Council and SWR will take place on the south side of the station at 13:00 BST.
The revamp has introduced new features, including a waiting lounge with a green roof to increase biodiversity.There is also a new taxi rank with space for up to five vehicles and an improved waiting area on Western Esplanade, suitable for 10 vehicles.Parking spaces for people with disabilities have also been introduced.The modernisation works include changes to the forecourt’s entrance and exit, and pedestrian improvements along Western Esplanade including an upgraded toucan crossing and footway improvements. 
Councillor Eamonn Keogh, cabinet member for environment and transport at Southampton City Council, said: “We want to ensure that our city’s gateways offer the best welcome to visitors, so we can help deliver on our plans to become a destination city."The works at the station will not only improve access to sustainable travel, but they also form part of our wider plans to improve public transport across the city and reduce congestion."All the new facilities look great, I am particularly impressed with the new passenger waiting lounge, which gives visitors a positive impression of Southampton on arrival and complements the art-deco style of the station.”
