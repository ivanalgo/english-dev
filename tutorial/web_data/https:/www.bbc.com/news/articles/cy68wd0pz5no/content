Glasgow has applied to join a drug-checking pilot scheme, which would allow drug users to test the content of illegal substances.A specialist facility would be based at the site of the UK’s first drug consumption room, which is scheduled to open in the city later this year.The application to the UK Home Office follows similar bids for drug check facilities in Aberdeen and Dundee.The Scottish government has committed £1m to establish the three national sites.
Drugs and Alcohol Policy Minister Christina McKelvie said it was a "welcome milestone".She added: "Drug-checking facilities would enable us to respond faster to emerging drug trends - which is particularly important given the presence of highly dangerous, super-strong synthetic opioids like nitazenes in an increasingly toxic and unpredictable drug supply. "These increase the risk of overdose, hospitalisation and death, and are being found in a range of substances."
It was announced in January that the UK's first regular drug-checking service would be launching in Bristol.It came four months after Glasgow was approved as the site of the UK's first official consumption room for illegal drugs.It was backed by the Scottish government to tackle Scotland's drugs death toll.The number of people who died due to drug misuse in Scotland in 2022/23 fell by 279 to the lowest level for five years.Figures from National Records of Scotland show 1,051 people died of drug misuse in 2022.
Glasgow councillor Allan Casey, city convener for workforce, homelessness and addiction services, said the drugs facility plans were progressing well on the site at Hunter Street.He said: "Being able to test drug samples on site will give staff the opportunity to engage with service users about what they're using and provide harm-reduction advice and support."
