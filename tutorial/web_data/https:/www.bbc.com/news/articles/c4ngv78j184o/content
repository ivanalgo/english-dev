He was also charged with failing to turn up for a court appearance in June.Det Sgt Gareth Kane objected to bail on a number of grounds including the seriousness of the charge, the nature and strength of the evidence and the potential sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison.Mr McGreevy's defence solicitor told the court his client had an acquired brain injury, had lost his father and had been abandoned by his mother when he was three.Refusing bail, Judge Paula Murphy said Mr McGreevy did not have a good record of turning up in court and remanded him in custody to appear in court again later in July.
