A ten-year-old Wolves fan who contracted an autoimmune disorder has had a surprise meeting with his favourite player.Hugo Bueno's visit to Oscar's home in Tettenhall, Wolverhampton, came after the story of his illness was shared with the club. Oscar needs to take a medicine made from donated plasma, following his diagnosis after his mother noticed unusual bruising on his legs while he was playing football in the garden.After filming an interview about his story, Oscar received a birthday card from  Bueno saying he’d love to play football with him at the park, which he did just a few days later. 
Oscar's condition, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), means he needs the medicine as it contains antibodies that stop white blood cells from destroying his platelets.During the visit, he took Spanish defender Bueno to Tettenhall Green for a kick around.  Now, Bueno has invited Oscar and his family to come along to watch the team train."The club told me about Oscar’s story and the fact he’s lost his confidence to play football with his friends," Bueno said."It was so nice to be able to visit Oscar at his home, teach him some new football skills and see him smile and having fun.“It feels so important that we try to bring back his love for the sport and help to make it a normal part of his life once again."
Joanne and Ken, Oscar’s parents, said: "Oscar is a shy boy, but has a real zest for life and loves being active."Since Hugo’s visit, Oscar’s confidence has grown, and has been asking us to return to playing football with his friends again.“Thank you to everyone who donates plasma because it helps people like Oscar to continue doing what they love."
ITP is a rare condition where the immune system destroys platelets, which help the blood to clot and prevent bleeding and bruising after injury.Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a medicine which is made from donated plasma, kickstarted Oscar’s recovery and allowed his family to explore several further treatment options. Thanks to plasma donors, Oscar was able to receive treatment to ease his symptoms and is currently in remission.Bueno added: "I encourage others to donate plasma to help more adults and children like Oscar who need plasma treatments to live their lives.“It only takes around an hour, and local Wolverhampton fans can donate at Birmingham Plasma Donor Centre”.
