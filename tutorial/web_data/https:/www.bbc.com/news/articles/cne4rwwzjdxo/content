Councillors in a historic city have begun a crackdown on shopfronts which have been criticised as being too garish or out of keeping with the area.Canterbury City Council has issued 22 enforcement notices to businesses in the Burgate, Sun Street, St Dunstan’s Street and North Lane areas of the city.The council said the shops are all in listed buildings and have been altered without permission.It said problems included inappropriate signs, flashing lights and paintwork that does not follow the conservation area guidelines. 
Hilary Brian, chair of the Canterbury Society, said: “With its World Heritage Site status, Canterbury is a city where you should be able to come and immerse yourself in its rich heritage and history.“Garish and overbearing shopfronts stand out like a sore thumb and shatter that perception in an instant.“I am convinced shopfronts that are sympathetic to the past will help drive footfall because the area becomes more attractive and that breeds confidence.
Councillor Michael Dixey, who is leading the enforcement action, said: “We’re really pleased that many of the businesses we targeted in the first phase of this crackdown have responded positively."
