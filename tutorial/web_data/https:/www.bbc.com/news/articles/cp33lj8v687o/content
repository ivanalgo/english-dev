A huge number of people attended Wolverhampton's Eid-al-Adha event in West Park, the council said.More than 5,000 people took part in the fourth annual festival to be staged there.It was organized by Jamia Masjid Al-Aqsa, the Wolverhampton Central Mosque, and officials said it brought together "a diverse congregation of individuals from across Wolverhampton and beyond".Sohail Khan, councillor for Tettenhall Regis, said: “We are thrilled by the turnout and the community spirit shown at this year's Eid in the Park."
Known as the "festival of sacrifice", Eid-al-Adha is time where Muslims honour and reflect on the Prophet Ibrahim though prayer and charity work.There were prayers and speeches with people able to enjoy free refreshments, the council said.In Birmingham, the wet weather saw Green Lane Mosque cancel its event in Small Heath Park but the rain stayed away for the gathering in West Park."It is heartwarming to see so many people come together to celebrate one of our faith’s most important days," Mr Khan said."The event at West Park was a testament to the community's unity and joy and it’s something Wolverhampton truly needs."
