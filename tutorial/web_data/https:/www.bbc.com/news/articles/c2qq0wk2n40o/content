Brahim Saadoun left Morocco to study in Ukraine in 2019 and when the Russians invaded in February 2022 he joined the Ukrainian army. He was captured by pro-Russian forces and sentenced to death for being a mercenary. In an agreement mediated by Saudi Arabia, Mr Saadoun was released in September 2022 and returned to Morocco. Since his return he's been unable to get a Moroccan passport to start a new life. Reporter: Sally Nabil Producer: Salma Elsayed Video editor: Gem O'Reilly
