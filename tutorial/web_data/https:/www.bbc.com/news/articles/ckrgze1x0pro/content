More than 1,700 people have signed a petition calling for more safety measures at a beach where a teenager went missing while swimming a week ago.Daniel Halliday's family said the 14-year-old was "jumping waves with his big brother" when he disappeared in strong currents at Crosby Beach, Merseyside at about 19:00 BST on Sunday.Despite searches involving the emergency services, he has not been found.In response to the petition, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) said they provided lifeguards at the beach daily, which was "permanently red-flagged to warn the public not to swim due to the dangers".
In a statement earlier this week, Daniel's family said: "Our worst fear is that this tragic accident has taken our lovely boy from us."Daniel was jumping waves with his big brother who tried to save him but the current was too strong."
Famous for its sculptures by artist Anthony Gormley, Crosby Beach is the only one in the country that has RNLI lifeguard cover every day, a spokeswoman said. She added lifeguards operated daily from 10:00 and 18:00 during the summer and between 10:00 and 16:00 in winter.However the petition has called for more lifeguards to cover more areas of the beach to prevent further incidents.Organisers said: "We ask our local council and the relevant authorities to urgently address this issue and ensure proper safety measures including the presence of lifeguards at Crosby Beach and the water marina from June through September."In response an RNLI representative said: "Local authorities work in partnership with the RNLI when determining what lifeguard cover is needed where, with factors such as number of visitors, the beach profile, hazards, risks and incident history all inputting to the decision-making process."They said the beach was declared a "non-bathing beach" meaning it was permanently red-flagged to warn the public not to swim due to the dangers.
