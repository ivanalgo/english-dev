An algal bloom has returned to Skegness Boating Lake despite a council treating the problem earlier this year.Local people have again criticised the unsightly appearance and “unbearable” odour at the southern end of the Lincolnshire lake.East Lindsey District Council pledged to address the issue in early May following complaints that it looked “absolutely disgusting” and “smelled awful".A spokesperson noted that although the lake had been treated with non-toxic chemical dosing and the problem was initially remedied, it has since returned.
The council hopes to solve the problem in the coming weeks, in time for the school summer holidays, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service.The spokesperson said an exact timeline could not be given, as there were many variables, including weather, water temperature and the amount of bacteria in the water.Pictures of the lake have again started to circulate online, with local resident Donna Raistrick heavily criticising the smell.In a Facebook post, she said: “The stench is unbearable and more than likely toxic; it will no doubt get worse in the heat.”The council spokesperson said: “A suspected case of algae at the southern Skegness Boating Lake was treated earlier this year with non-toxic chemicals and other products to deter its spread.“We regularly monitor the water quality and, following a recent return of the issue last week, work is currently taking place to dose and treat the lake, followed by a further treatment in a week’s time to ensure it has fully dispersed and that the much-loved facilities are in the best possible condition ahead of the main season.”
