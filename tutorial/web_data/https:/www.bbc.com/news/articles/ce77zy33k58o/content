A speech therapist has spoken of her “wonderful experience” at Buckingham Palace after attending a royal garden party.Charlotte Colesby, service manager for speech and language therapy at the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, was invited in recognition of her work in her field.The mother-of-two from Stourbridge said it rained throughout the day but it failed to dampen her spirits.“It’s really something you wouldn’t expect to have the chance to do ordinarily, so I’m very proud – it feels like a dream,” she said.
Ms Colesby, 54, was accompanied by Janet McGookin, who represented the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists – the group that organised Ms Colesby’s invite.Guests were treated to afternoon tea inside a giant marquee at the back of the palace, while they listened to The Band of the Household Cavalry and the Central Band of the Royal Air Force.Ms Colesby said: “It was an interesting mix of very formal and informal. People were dressed up, and there were some really important people there.”
Her attendance at the event on 21 May has also boosted the 78 members of staff she leads at the Gem Centre in Wednesfield.“People have been so pleased for me, and I think it has given the whole team a lift,” she said.
