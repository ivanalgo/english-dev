A couple who converted their garage into a mini pub have made it to the final of a UK-wide competition.Kev and Gina Marchant built The Winchester at their home in Eastleigh, Hampshire, during the Covid lockdown.Their creation is now one of three finalists for the Pub Shed of the Year 2024.Mrs Marchant said it would mean "everything" to win, adding: "It will mean that what we've done is appreciated."
Mr Marchant had always wanted to build a bar but he said lockdown was the encouragement he needed."We decided if we can't go to the pub, we'll bring the pub to us," he said.He said it took about six weeks to build but, despite his connections in the construction industry, sourcing everything for the "old-school" interior proved tricky."We both knew that all the pub-related stuff had to be authentic," said Mrs Marchant.
But she said as soon as it was finished "it was all worth it"."By the time you've pulled your first drink and you're halfway through it you really do get the vibe of a pub atmosphere," said Mr Marchant.The name of the pub is a nod to the city where Mr and Mrs Marchant grew up and met, as well as to the iconic pub in the film Shaun of the Dead."It just felt fitting," said Mrs Marchant.
Voting for the winner is open until 3 August.Mrs Marchant said she did not know the bar had been entered into the competition, so when she heard it was a finalist she was "flabbergasted"."I just couldn't believe it," she said.Mr Marchant said it would be "absolutely amazing" to win, but even getting to the final was "an honour".
