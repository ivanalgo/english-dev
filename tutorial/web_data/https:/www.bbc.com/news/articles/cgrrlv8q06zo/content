Plans for new homes in a rural area, which shares the name of the fictional land inhabited by Winnie-the-Pooh, have been approved. Forest of Dean councillors gave the go ahead for two houses to be built in Hundred Acre Wood, Drybrook, Gloucestershire. The fictional Hundred Acre Wood in the Winnie-the-Pooh stories was inspired by Five Hundred Acre Wood in Ashdown Forest, East Sussex.While introducing the proposals, development management committee chairman Dave Wheeler jokingly said he assumed the plans had nothing to do with Pooh Bear.
The homes have an L-shaped formation and share similar design characteristics, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. The houses have been designed as 1.5 storey units, with solar panels on the roof, and will be built on a field off Whitehill Lane.The committee voted to approve the scheme, with 10 votes in favour and one abstention on 11 June.
