Two men were rescued in rough seas when their boat suffered engine failure.Caister Lifeboat said it was called to a "vessel in difficulty" five nautical miles east of Waxham, Norfolk, at about 15:00 BST on Thursday.When a crew member boarded the stricken boat and attached a tow line one of the men became "nauseous" so another lifeboat was called to "extract the casualties from their vessel".Guy Gibson, coxswain of the independent lifeboat, described the sea conditions as "challenging".
"When we arrived on scene, a north-west wind was picking up," he said."Another hour or so the men could have been in a muddle. It's a good job we got there when we did."The East of England Ambulance Service said it was called to assess a man at Caister Lifeboat station, but he did not need hospital treatment.
