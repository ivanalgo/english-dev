Pay and display parking should not be introduced in several Devon towns due to a "significant level of objections", it has been recommended to councillors.Devon County Council (DCC) proposed introducing paid parking to cut congestion in the "key areas" of Braunton, Crediton, Dartmouth, Honiton, Okehampton, Salcombe, Sidmouth and Tavistock.However, the council's director of transport recommended to councillors the proposal should not proceed further.Councillors were told the authority had received a "significant level of objections" to the proposals in a consultation process.
Businesses, politicians and residents had heavily campaigned against the proposals.In a report to the cabinet, the council said it received more than 5,000 objections to a consultation in December and January.It said most respondents said the proposals would have an impact on the high street and businesses.Other people said the existing parking restrictions were already effective, the proposals would generate income for the council and argued parking availability for workers would be reduced.Meg Booth, DCC's director of climate change, environment and transport, said introducing paid parking could help cut down on vehicles overstaying time limits.However, she said it was "important that the council recognises the significant level of objections that have been received"."It is therefore recommended that proposals are not implemented," she said.DCC had said the introduction of metered parking would encourage higher turnover of parking spaces.The council's cabinet is due to decide on the proposal on 13 March.
