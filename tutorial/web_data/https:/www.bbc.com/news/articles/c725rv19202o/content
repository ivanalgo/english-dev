A man who ran the entire length of Africa has been forced to stop his latest challenge due to injury.Russ Cook, nicknamed “Hardest Geezer”, had been running to each England match at Euro 2024 in Germany after setting off from Wembley Stadium on 11 June.However, the 27-year-old, from Worthing, West Sussex, says a “flare up” of an old back injury means he is unable to run to the final on Sunday.“I’m just going to enjoy this one like a normal human being,” he said.
Mr Cook has covered 608 miles (980km) on foot since his latest endurance test began.“Absolutely buzzing they’ve made it to the final. One more game to make history,” he posted on X, formerly Twitter.“See you in Berlin.”
Mr Cook’s previous challenge began at South Africa's most southerly point on 22 April 2023, and finished more than 10,190 miles (16,400km) north in Tunisia.Despite complications with visas, health scares, geopolitical issues and an armed robbery, he completed the run and raised more than £1m ($1.27m) for charity.Mr Cook, who is raising money for The Running Charity, will be donating his sponsorship from Sports Direct and Score Draw to the charity, which supports young people who are homeless or have complex needs.
