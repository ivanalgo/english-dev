More than 35,000 people are expected to attend one of the largest spiritual conventions in the UK.The three-day Jalsa Salana, starting on Friday, is held annually on a farm near Alton, Hampshire, attracting members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community from across the world.Organisers said this year's event would have a special emphasis on prayers and peace, urging Muslims to play their role in reducing global volatility and uncertainty.The event, which is broadcast worldwide, includes a seminar on news reporting of the war in Gaza, as well as spiritual ceremonies.
Rafiq Hayat, UK President of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, said: "Our convention is a reminder that our duty as Muslims is to be loyal, peaceful and dutiful citizens."Through our motto 'Love for All, Hatred for None' we aim to build stronger, more cohesive communities and promote peace and tolerance."The Ahmadi movement has its origins in British-controlled northern India in the late 19th Century.
Orthodox Muslims consider followers as heretical as they do not believe Mohammed was the final prophet sent to guide mankind.First held in 1964, Jalsa Salana UK moved to the site at East Worldham in 2006 after it was purchased by the community to accommodate more attendees.Organisers of this year's convention said they hoped to ease previous traffic congestion by opening a new entrance as well as providing shuttle buses.
