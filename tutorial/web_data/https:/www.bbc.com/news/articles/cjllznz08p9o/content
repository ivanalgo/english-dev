A shirt made famous when it was shown clinging to a soaking wet Colin Firth in period drama Pride and Prejudice has gone on display.The linen, which was seen by millions in the 1995 BBC adaptation of the Jane Austen novel, was bought by Calderdale Council at an auction in March for £25,000.Mr Darcy's shirt will now go on public display at Bankfield Museum in Halifax until the end of the year."We know that many people have been eager to see it for themselves," Councillor Danielle Durrans said.
Mr Darcy memorably emerged from a lake in the shirt, transforming Firth into a screen sex symbol.The shirt will feature as part of Calderdale's Year of Culture 2024 allowing fans to get up close and personal.
At auction, the costume was estimated to sell for up to £10,000, but it eventually went for £25,000 in total with all money going to charity.Calderdale Council's bid was funded by donations to the Works of Art Fund from visitors to the region's museums, it said.Bankfield Museum has long been known for its large textiles collection with the new items of costume history being preserved.“With the borough already known as a booming TV and film location, we want to marry this up with Bankfield Museum and Calderdale’s textile heritage and create a legacy of costume and culture,” said Ms Durrans.The shirt is accompanied by other key items from Mr Darcy’s outfit, including his breeches, coat, waistcoat and cravat.Other items bought at the auction are to go on display next year, including the Gentleman Jack outfit worn by Suranne Jones, the yellow pelisse from the 2020 film adaptation of Jane Austen’s Emma, two outfits from Downton Abbey and the King and Queen’s costumes from The King’s Speech.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
