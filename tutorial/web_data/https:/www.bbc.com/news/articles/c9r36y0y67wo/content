Ten new businesses have been helped to open on Aberdeen's Union Street in the first year of an empty shops grant scheme, the city council has said.Six traders have arrived since the £195,000 thousand pound fund opened, with a further four in the process of moving to the so-called Granite Mile.The grant scheme covers up to 50% percent of project costs.Union Street runs through the heart of Aberdeen and was once its main retail hub, but - like many city centres - has seen a rise in vacant premises.
The council said there are now 38 vacant units on Union Street, down from 47 a year ago.Lauren Reid runs the ladies fashion boutique Lolo and Co, which moved into to Union Street back in March. She said the grant scheme had definitely helped."It's been difficult don't get me wrong, it's not an overnight fix, nothing is," she told BBC Scotland News."It's even nice to see people walking about, people want to support local."It's just nice to bring other units on to Union Street and see a lot more business flowing in Aberdeen, because it's needed."
Other new businesses on Union Street include a gaming store, a watch retailer and a coffee shop.The council's finance and resources committee convener, Alex McLellan, said: “It is fantastic the Union Street Empty Shops Grant Scheme has helped to create these new stores".Union Street had already faced stiff competition from the nearby Union Square complex, which opened in 2009 and is home to big-name shops, restaurants and a cinema.The coronavirus pandemic then added to the challenges.
