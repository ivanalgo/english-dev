Part of a major road in North Yorkshire which has been closed since early February due to a landslip is to reopen.The A59 at Kex Gill, a vital route connecting Harrogate, Skipton and the Dales, was badly damaged during wet weather in the winter.The road is due to reopen from Saturday, meaning an end to lengthy diversions for drivers.North Yorkshire Council said the work would be completed ahead of schedule.
North Yorkshire Council said the start of the year was "one of the wettest on record".It was reported earlier this month that repairs to the stretch of road had already reached Â£1.8m. The repairs involved installing a structural wall using 85 metres of steel sheets. Villages in Askwith complained that they were suffering travel chaos as drivers used their area as a diversion route.North Yorkshire Council said: "Kex Gill has a history of landslips and over the years there have been many unplanned and costly closures."Corporate director of environment Karl Battersby added: "We thank residents and businesses for their continued patience whilst these essential works come to an end."Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.
