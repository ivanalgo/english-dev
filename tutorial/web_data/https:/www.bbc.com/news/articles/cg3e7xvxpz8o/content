A student is attempting to set a world record by drawing portraits for 80 consecutive hours.Abidemi Praise Omopariola, known as Praise, set up an easel at a Sunderland bar where she has been putting pencil to paper for days.She hopes to set a Guinness World Record for the Longest Marathon Portrait Drawing and will wrap up her attempt on Friday.Speaking to the BBC more than two days into the attempt, Ms Omopariola said: "I wasn't tired at first but 60 hours is a lot, I might have to take a cup of coffee."
The Nigerian student is based in Deigo's Joint, a venue in Sunderland that has seen a steady stream of visitors arrive to lend their support."They've done a great job for me," Ms Omopariola said. "They are why I'm still standing here."The artist said she is averaging one portrait every five hours, which is much faster than her usual rate of one every two or three days.She told the BBC Guinness suggested 50 hours would constitute a record, but she is aiming for 80 in an effort to make it more difficult for someone else to break.
Ms Omopariola started drawing as a child and said she is inspired by "women who are always striving for greatness"."I lost my father at a very young age and my mother has always been the one striving and pushing hard to see me achieve great success in life and to see the sky as the starting point."
