The owner of a pub in Silverstone village is gearing up for a "crackers" weekend of drinks sales, as the British Grand Prix roars into Northamptonshire.Malcolm Gray, who runs the White Horse, has arranged extra deliveries of beer to cope with demand from fans and race officials.He said there would be a fourfold increase in trade during the four-day meeting.The owner of the village shop has also ordered in extra supplies.
Mr Gray took over the pub just over a year ago, so he has already experienced life in the village during one of the UK's biggest sporting events.He said: "It's absolutely crackers."It starts on the Wednesday - we do a steak offer for the stewards up at the circuit, and about 150 to 200 of them come down here."Then, on the first day of the meeting, "it goes ballistic - you're probably looking at four times your normal trade".
He added: "We've got three beer deliveries pencilled in. We had the first one on Monday, so the cellar's full from ceiling to floor with beer."The last special delivery will be at midnight on Friday.Demand for liquid refreshment could be particularly high this year, as Saturday also sees a crucial Euro 2024 quarter-final match for England's footballers.Mr Gray said a win for Gareth Southgate's side would be "good for trade and good for the morale of the country".
Across the road, Matthew Croft and his team at Croft Stores are also making sure the shelves are well stocked.He said: "We plan for the weekend about three months in advance."The volumes that we have to bring in are exceptional and we have to make sure that we get the figures right, if we can."
There will be deliveries every day until Sunday, so fans camping or staying in houses in the village are kept well supplied.He said turnover could triple during the race meeting, so it was "crucial for our business".He added: "It's our best weekend of the year, our hardest one, but we want to make sure we get the job done right."
