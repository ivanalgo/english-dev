The life of a man who collapsed during a walking football session was saved when a team of nurses sprang into action.Roy Walley, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, suffered a cardiac arrest while he was taking part in the activity at Longton Rugby Club in Stoke-on-Trent.The nurses performed CPR and used a defibrillator before he was flown to hospital by air ambulance.Mr Walley, who has since recovered and returned home, said he would not have survived if it was not for their “speedy actions”.
“I’m very lucky to be here, and I’m looking forward to one day playing walking football again,” he added.After being stabilised, Mr Walley was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) – a device implanted in the chest that can send an electrical shock to the heart when it detects a life-threatening, rapid heartbeat.
Mr Walley’s saviours were part of the Trust’s Community Nursing team at the Midlands Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (MPFT) and had been training at the site when Mr Walley collapsed on 8 May.Nurse Karen Stonier said it was a challenging situation, but the fact the rugby club had a defibrillator on site helped to save Mr Walley’s life.“I’m sure I speak for everyone when I say we’re very thankful it worked out well,” she said.
