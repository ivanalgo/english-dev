A university choir is to sing in Vatican City after asking for the privilege.Castle Chapel Choir at Durham University will perform at one of the most famous churches in the world, St Peter's Basilica, on 5 September. Tom Parker, a PhD student and the choir's director of music, said he contacted officials and asked if they could come and sing as part of their tour."If you don't ask, you don't get," he said.
British university choirs have previously sung at the basilica including the University of Oxford in 2017. Mr Parker said the choir of 19 would be singing four or five pieces between each segment of the Holy Mass."We are going to do a mixture of Italian and English music," he added.He also said he was not sure if Pope Francis would watch them perform.Kate Ryan, a second-year student and choir member, said the fact they would be singing in Vatican City had not "sunk in" yet."This is building is absolutely integral to all of religious history - I think it's going to be definitely a once in a lifetime experience."University College Durham's chaplain, the Reverend Sam Hole, said the opportunity to sing in the state was a "pretty special thing to be doing".
