“If Denmark get to the final, it will all be worth it.”Mr Pedersen moved to Bridgnorth from Denmark in 1992, having witnessed his nation emerge victorious in the Euros that year with a 2-0 win over Germany.
He said he was in the southern part of Germany at the time of the competition and that the tournament has held a special place in his heart ever since.“If it could at all be possible to do it again, it would be fantastic. Therefore, I do believe that Denmark can go all the way,” he said.Denmark were held to a 1-1 draw against Slovenia during their first game of Euro 2024 on Sunday.They take on England on Thursday, with the match kicking off at 17:00 BST.
