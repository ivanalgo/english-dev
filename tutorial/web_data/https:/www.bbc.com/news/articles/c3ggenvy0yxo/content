A Kent barber, who used to suffer from severe anxiety, said he is "overwhelmed" by the popularity of a training session he has organised for other barbers on how to identify mental health problems in clients.Jake Cox set up his No Bad Days barber shop in Chatham in 2021 after struggling with anxiety for many years.The free training session, which takes place on St Mary's Island on Monday, is expected to have a full capacity of 20 and Mr Cox said he wants to arrange more.    Jessica Silver, from North Kent Mind, who helped organise the day, said it was a "unique and innovative opportunity to work closely with our community".
Mr Cox said: "I've had tattooists and hairdressers coming to me asking if I could run a course for them. "The whole plan was that this would be a test and we'll try to unroll courses elsewhere."I want to give barbers the confidence to know how to deal with hard topics and not shy away.  "I would love to get a team together and take this country-wide. I'm sure the demand is there."
Barber Can Ozdamar, who runs Can Cuts in Farnborough, is attending the course. He said: "Barbers joke around and say we're like therapists for our clients. "But it would be really good to learn how to develop my skills in identifying their problems and learn what to look out for."Ms Silver added: "Working alongside Jake, we have designed bespoke training aimed at supporting barbers, who men may feel more comfortable discussing their struggles with."
