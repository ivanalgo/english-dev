A zoo is celebrating after seeing the highest number of endangered baby penguins to hatch in a decade.A total of 11 Humboldt penguin chicks hatched at Chester Zoo in mid-April.Experts at the zoo said the species was the most at-risk of the 17 penguin species, due to climate change and over-fishing.They are naming this year’s chicks after plants, with Nettle, Thistle, Dandelion, Tulip and Daffodil among the confirmed names so far.
Previous naming themes have included NHS heroes and British Olympians.Zoe Sweetman, the zoo’s team manager of parrots and penguins, said they could have named the 11 chicks after a football team, but they opted to go with plants.“Nettle and Thistle are the more spiky characters among the group, whereas Tulip and Daffodil have colourful personalities.“We’re delighted to say that all of the chicks are looking really healthy and the parents have done a superb job of caring for their new arrivals up to this point.”Humboldt penguins are listed as vulnerable to extinction.Found on the shores of Peru and Chile, the penguin species is named after the Humboldt current in which they usually swim, reaching maximum speeds of 25mph.
