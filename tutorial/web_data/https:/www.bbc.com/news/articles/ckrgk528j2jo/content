A new vaccine which will protect babies and older adults against a common but potentially dangerous respiratory infection will be rolled out in Wales.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but can lead to bronchiolitis and pneumonia.More than a thousand babies in Wales are hospitalised every year with the infection. The programme will be offered to pregnant women (from 28 weeks) and those aged 75 to 79 years old. For most people, RSV causes a mild respiratory illness with cold-like symptoms.  However, for babies under one year, and the elderly, there is a significant risk of severe infection which could result in hospitalisation.Eluned Morgan, Wales' health secretary, encouraged all those who are eligible to take up the offer, and said the vaccine is safe and effective. Dr Christopher Johnson, head of the Vaccine Preventable Disease Programme at Public Health Wales, welcomed the announcement. "It is a game-changing new vaccination programme that will protect thousands of our most vulnerable from getting ill in the first place, or significantly reducing the likelihood of severe infection, keeping people out of hospital and from needing to see a GP, and enabling more people to benefit from NHS service,‚Äù he said.
