Newcastle-under-Lyme's new Labour MP has asked a government minister to visit the constituency "to listen, to learn and to smell" the issues facing local people.Adam Jogee called for the health and environment departments to hold talks about the possible effects of gas from landfill sites on peopleâ€™s health.His constituents were scared and angry about the impact of hydrogen sulphide being emitted from Walleys Quarry in Silverdale, he said.Walleys Quarry Ltd (WQL) said the site was stringently regulated and that it was focussed on minimising its impact on the community.
Speaking in Parliament, Mr Jogee said: "Walleys Quarry landfill in Newcastle-under-Lyme is an environmental crisis and a health one too."In response he was told that public health was a priority for the new government.Parliamentary under-secretary for health and social care Andrew Gwynne said he would be visit Mr Jogee's constituency to learn more about the issue from local people.It comes as a council-led inquiry got under way this week to hear public testimony from community groups, Silverdale Parish Council and a local GP.Also giving evidence were Simon Tagg, the leader of Newcastle-under-Borough Council as well as planning and health officials from Staffordshire County Council and the former MP Aaron Bell.
Mr Tagg, who last week expressed regret that the landfill operator would not be present at the inquiry, said rising numbers of complaints meant odour problems in the town from the landfill had not been dealt with.He said he wanted the site to be closed in order to end potential health issues for residents.He added that he had written to the newly appointed secretary of state for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Steve Reed, to seek permission for the council to pursue legal action against the operator.A spokesperson for the landfill said the company had been asked to submit an update on actions, which it had done by providing a written report to the inquiry."The team is focused on managing the site to minimise impacts to community around the site and we will continue to do so," they added.The EA said it had every sympathy with the local community and that it remained committed to maintaining long-term reductions in emissions, while robustly regulating the site."If we identify permit non-compliances, we inform WQL and require the company to take remedial action," a spokesperson said.
