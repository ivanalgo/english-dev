A woman given six months to live was diagnosed with cancer just months after her own mother died of the disease.Rachael Blake, 39, of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, has an inherited gene, known as BRCA2, that "greatly increases" the risk of women developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer.Earlier this year she married her long-term partner, Reggie, and said "making memories" with her sons was how she wanted to spend the "precious time" she had left.Later Ms Blake will cut the ribbon of a new Cancer Research UK charity shop in Norwich.
"It might be too late for me but it's incredibly important people get the help they need as soon as possible to ensure they have a better chance of survival and prognosis," she said."If I can help anyone going through what I have been through then that's a positive."
Ms Blake said she found a "dent" in her left breast In August 2020.Her mother Jennie Tubby had died of pancreatic cancer earlier the same year, aged 62, so she "decided to get it checked out".A month later she was diagnosed with grade three oestrogen-positive ductal breast cancer."My surgeon had referred me because I was only 36 at the time," she said."They didn't think it was linked to my mum, but once I was diagnosed with BRCA2, which is linked to breast cancer, ovaries and pancreas, it looked like my mum had it and it was inherited from her dad."Ms Blake received chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but two years after being declared cancer-free, doctors discovered she had incurable secondary breast cancer in the liver.
Ms Blake said she remained positive and wanted life to be as "normal as possible" for her sons Archie, 12, and Finley, 14, and stepson Harvey, 13."Finley came into my room one day and said 'So Mum, how's cancer going?' I just laughed and asked him if he meant chemo, he replied 'That is cancer, isn't it?'"My oncologist started me on a new chemotherapy plan which should hopefully give me another precious six months with my family."I'm hoping with the limited  time I have left I can take them abroad and see them swimming in the sunshine, without a care in the world. That would be my ultimate dream."

Ms Blake said she wanted to help raise awareness and funds for more cancer research and better treatment.Later she is due to cut the ribbon of a new Cancer Research UK discount superstore on Riverside, Norwich.Julie Byard, director of trading for Cancer Research UK, said: "We are delighted to have Rachael here as our guest of honour."Her story really bring home the importance of raising funds to support the charity's ground-breaking work into the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer."Cancer Research UK said its shops helped the charity raise Â£127m last year.The NHS said one in two people would develop some form of cancer during their lifetime, with breast cancer among the most common.
