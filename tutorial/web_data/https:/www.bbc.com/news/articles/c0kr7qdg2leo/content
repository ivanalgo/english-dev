A collection of five prints created from the trunk of the Sycamore Gap tree have gone on public display.The 200-year-old tree, which towered 50ft above Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland, was illegally felled last September.Printmaker Shona Branigan was approached by the National Trust to create the artworks, which are being exhibited at four locations along  Hadrian’s Wall.The giant tree prints show every ring, groove and detail from the cross-section of the almost heart shaped trunk.
Ms Branigan said: "I felt privileged to be asked so that I could honour not only the tree itself but all the people who loved the tree too."
Andrew Poad, General Manager for the National Trust at Hadrian’s Wall, said: "The Sycamore Gap tree was adored by so many, and we wanted to create opportunities for the public to further connect with the tree."Ms Branigan described the tree as a "haven in a wild landscape"."It's a really big piece and a slow process due to it all being done by hand."It's taken several hours, and my muscles are definitely aching after the effort but, now that the series of prints are complete, I am pleased and proud of my work."
The exhibition will run until 1 September ,before all five prints go on display together at The Queen’s Hall, Hexham, from 6 September until 19 October.
