An Irish shipping company has stopped accepting freight that has travelled through Cherbourg because of issues caused by migrant stowaways.Hyland Shipping, based in Dublin, told BBC News NI that it encountered "unprecedented" problems last week.CCTV footage from the company warehouse showed six men jumping from the inside of one trailer.Managing director Tino Hyland said there was evidence of stowaways in nine trailers last week.He said all the vehicles had passed through the French port."They hide in the freight in the trailer, they tear stuff apart and climb down into boxes in order to hide themselves from a cursory glance of a security officer down in the port," he said.Mr Hyland added that the damage to trailers and freight is costing the company and its customers thousands of euros."We're talking at least €10,000 (£8,500) worth of damage to the freight in the trailer, in that one trailer, and then there was the damage to all the other trailers," he said.
Mr Hyland said many of the stowaways gain entry to trailers by cutting the heavy-duty exterior curtains, which then need to be "replaced or repaired, depending on whether it's possible". He said further damage is then caused when the stowaways hide among goods in boxes inside the trailers.The company director believes most of the stowaways disembark at ports before the freight arrives at their warehouse for distribution.But, he said, the trailers and the goods are already damaged by the presence of migrants among the freight.
The decision to stop accepting freight through Cherbourg has resulted in additional travel costs for the shipping company, as well as delays for some of its customers on both sides of the Irish border."The alternative ferry is a lot more expensive, about 40% more expensive. You've got extra mileage involved but also, because the regularity of the ferry is less often, you're delaying freight," he continued.Mr Hyland stressed that he has sympathy for migrants who are fleeing conflict or danger in other parts of the world, but he said the practice of hiding inside trucks is "massively dangerous" for stowaways."It's horrible for them," he added.In addition, Mr Hyland said, it is very difficult for small companies to absorb the additional costs caused by damage to vehicles and freight.Security around Cherbourg has been increased in recent years to address issues arising from the global migration crisis, but Hyland Shipping believes its experiences last week highlight the ongoing challenges facing operators in the freight and shipping industry.
