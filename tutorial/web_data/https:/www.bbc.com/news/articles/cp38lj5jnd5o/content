The "largest open exhibition in the North West" has returned to a town's museum with its organisers promising the "biggest year yet".Warrington Arts Festival's (WAF) annual Open Exhibition will feature 96 "ambitious artworks" chosen from about 900 submissions, the highest number of entries in the event's 14-year history.A WAF representative said among the works on display at Warrington Museum and Art Gallery were a double-headed rocking horse and a film of an artist submerged in a bathtub.Guest curator Sarah Harris said the showcase reflected the "current times, highlighting the themes that resonate with our artists".
The multidisciplinary artist, who grew up in the town, said it was "essential for creative minds to have the space to produce work that challenges and inspires us"."The exhibition features a remarkable array of artists from across the North West, with a strong representation from Warrington," she said."It's been fascinating to explore the issues they are addressing."WAF said the competition provided "a springboard for gifted artists of every discipline" and had benefited from its own relaunch."Re-energised by an expanded team and powered by £840,000 in grant funding from Arts Council England, Warrington Borough Council and Warrington BID, this led to the event breaking records with the most submissions in its 14-year history," its representative said.
The event was open to artists living within a 60-mile radius of Warrington, although organisers said the majority of 2024's entries came from local residents.After a judging ceremony and launch event on Thursday, Skye Baker was awarded First Prize for a performance piece called Guttural, while Kamil Duda was named Emerging Artist.Baker's work, which shows her fully submerged in a bathtub as black food dye pools out of her mouth, was described as "an exploration of her personal identity and vulnerability", while Duda's A+B, a large double headed rocking horse accompanied by a video, showed a "playfulness and technical skill" according to the judges.Works by Jasper Pedyo, Chloe Watts, Richard Meaghan, Lawal Ibrahim, Sean O’Farrell, Olivia Hawkswell and Justine Lesage were also highly commended.Warrington Museum producer Roger Jeffery said it had been "so inspiring to see all the artwork submitted"."I'd like to thank all the artists who entered, the judges for going through all the submissions and making their selection, and of course Sarah Harris for doing such a wonderful job of curating the exhibition," he said.The Open Exhibition is free to view and runs at Warrington Museum and Art Gallery until 29 September.
