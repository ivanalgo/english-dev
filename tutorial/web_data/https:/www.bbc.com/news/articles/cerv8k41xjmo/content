A new vaccination programme aimed at protecting new born babies and older adults against the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and its complications has been approved in Northern Ireland.From this September, all pregnant women will be offered the RSV vaccination, providing infants with protection against the virus from birth, Northern Ireland's Department of Health said. Adults aged from 75-79 years of age will also be offered the RSV vaccination.Health Minister Mike Nesbitt said the virus has a "significant impact" on the health service during the winter.
He said: "My department has approved the RSV programme following the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and in line with the approach being taken across the other UK nations."A similar roll-out was recently announced in Wales.Mr Nesbitt said he encourages all of those eligible to "avail of the vaccination to help protect themselves and their baby from illness."For most people, RSV causes a mild respiratory illness with cold-like symptoms.However, for babies under one year, and the elderly, there is a significant risk of severe infection which could result in being taken to hospital.Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride described the roll out as an "important public health measure.""For generations we have seen how effective vaccinations have been in eradicating diseases and protecting children and other vulnerable groups from serious illness and death, but we are now seeing a worrying decline in the uptake of childhood immunisations" he added.Mr McBride said vaccinations offer children the "very best start in life" and "quite simply, if children aren't vaccinated, they're not protected."
