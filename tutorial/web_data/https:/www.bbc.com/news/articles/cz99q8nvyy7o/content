The proportion of state-educated pupils accepted by Oxford University has fallen for the third year in a row.Figures show 67.6% of successful undergraduates living in the UK were educated at state schools in 2023 – but the proportion is still higher than pre-pandemic levels.The university’s annual admissions report, published on Monday, showed the number of UK-domiciled Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) has increased since 2019.A university spokesperson said it is “committed to attracting students with the highest academic potential, from a diverse range of backgrounds”.
Despite the drop over the last three years, the proportion of state school undergraduates remains higher than in 2019. That year, 62.3% of them arrived from UK state schools.Similarly, the proportion of UK-domiciled students admitted to Oxford who said they identify as BME rose from 27.8% in 2022 to 28.8% in 2023.The University of Oxford spokesperson said: "Oxford embraces students from all school types and is committed to attracting students with the highest academic potential, from a diverse range of backgrounds."The proportion of UK undergraduates from state schools has risen considerably in recent years, from 60.5% in 2018 to 67.6% in 2023."This figure can be affected by a number of factors, including the number of applicants who successfully meet the conditions of their offer."Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), called the figures "disappointing" as she said it is "still a long way short of reflecting wider society."She said: "For example, 67.6% of Oxford admissions were to state school pupils, whereas about 93% of all pupils go to state schools in England."If we want a more equitable society we have to do more to achieve that objective."
