Proposals for a venue created from shipping containers and a cinema have been included in a plan to overhaul a town centre. Sandwell Council has unveiled schemes to revitalise Wednesbury as part of a "masterplan".New cycle lanes in Victoria Street, Dudley Street, High Bullen and Trouse Lane are also included.Documents also mention "cycling hubs" in Union Street and Wednesbury Great Western Street metro station for cycle parking and e-bike charging. 
The shipping containers would be used to create a boxpark-style venue, similar to ones in London, to provide a space for independent businesses, food and drink stalls, live music and an outdoor cinema.The town's Gaumont Cinema in Walsall Street which closed in 2010 and has been left to fall into ruin, could also be transformed and reopened as a new cinema and theatre under the plans.But the site could also be used as an entertainment complex with a bowling alley arcades or adventure golf or as an arts, events and exhibition space. New bars and restaurants would also be included.
The plans also include empty spaces in High Bullen, Union Street and Victoria Street as potential sites for more than 100 new apartments, supported living accommodation, health centres, shops, bars and restaurants.Dudley Street and High Bullen could also see junctions and crossings simplified, lanes cut and more trees planted so they are less "cut off".Sandwell Council said the masterplan would be used as a "guide" in its decisions as well as to help access money – particularly government funding.The green space in Church Hill could also be “reinvigorated” with new links to the town centre as well as becoming a “destination” children’s play area.The long-term plans include more events such as markets and fetes, new heritage signs and public art with more trees and plants.The number of car parks could also be cut under the proposals with improvements made to Morrisons and Spring Head car parks.
