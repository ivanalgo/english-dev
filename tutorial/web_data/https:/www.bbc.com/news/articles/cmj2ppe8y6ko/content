A University of Brighton student will be heading to South Africa on an international tour with the England women’s deaf rugby union team.Biological sciences student Samm Hart is a member of the university’s Panthers rugby team and plays in the Rugby Women’s Championship for Richmond Rugby Club.She was a late selection for a self-funded place in the 27-woman squad, which goes on tour in August, after she replaced an injured player.“I can't describe in words how much of an honour it is to play for my country,” she said.
Ms Hart is fundraising to cover the costs of the trip.She has received donations from Surrey Rugby, based in Thames Ditton, and Sport Brighton, where she works as an intern supporting the training of other players.The player said she was “shocked and grateful” to have been picked.“This tour will involve my debut for my country and add international caps to my playing history. It will be a great opportunity to develop my rugby community and skills to a higher level and fully integrate myself into my new team.”Lucy Callingham, the university’s sports development officer, said: “Samm has played a crucial role in supporting the growth of the women's rugby club through her dedicated coaching support.“Her journey is an inspiration to us all.”
