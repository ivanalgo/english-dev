A tip site is looking to set up a permanent shop stocked with items deemed too good to throw away.Raynesway Household Waste and Recycling Centre, in Derby, has been hosting a series of pop-up events to sell items ranging from fitness equipment to sleeping bags, which would otherwise have been binned.The temporary shops have raised money for Derby City Council, its contractor HW Martin and charity, as well as saving items from landfill.The council is now investigating the possibility of a permanent shop on site.
Carly Walker, technical manager for waste at the council, said: "They're really popular and we know there's a demand for pre-loved items."That's why we're planning more of these pop-up events and longer term, a permanent shop on site is our aim."There's an opportunity to recycle most things."Really, the traditional waste skip should be a last resort for most things, but it's not always the case. People do bring in a lot of stuff that could be put to much better use."We encourage anyone that's got items they think might be too good to throw away to donate them, and if you're unsure, speak to a member of staff."
The next dates of pop-up sales at the Raynesway waste site are Friday and Saturday, as well as 9, 10, 23 and 24 August - all from 12:00 to 18:00 BST on Fridays, and from 08:00 to 18:00 on Saturdays.No booking is required to visit the pop-up shop, although anyone bringing waste at the same time will have to book a slot as usual.Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
