Two Preston villages are to get new sports grounds and a new community venue â€“ replacing a facility that has been standing for more than 70 years.The existing Whittingham and Goosnargh Sports and Social Club will be demolished to make way for a modern, larger building.The new club will be built alongside the recently completed Whittingham Park housing development, off Whittingham Lane and will also include a caravan and camping area and events space as part of the wider site.An 11-a-side senior football pitch, multi-use games area and tennis court will all form part of the scheme, while the existing bowling green will be retained.
The area was reserved for community facilities as part of the planning permission granted for the neighbouring new homes and Preston City Council's planning committee has now given the green light to the details of the proposal.The new building will include a bar, function room, members' lounge, games room, meeting space and kitchen facilities. An outdoor terrace will overlook the bowling green.Changing rooms will be constructed on the pitches which will also be marked out for football as well as basketball and tennis, for which removable posts and nets will be installed.While the existing bowling green is to be kept in its current location, a new bowling kiosk and separate away team shelter will be created and improved lighting put in place.There will be parking for 95 vehicles, including disabled bays and space for two minibuses.The blueprint was approved by a majority of planning committee members and was also supported by Whittingham Parish Council.
