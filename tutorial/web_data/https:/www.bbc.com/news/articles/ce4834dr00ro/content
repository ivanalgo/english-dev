Student George Rabbet-Smith was 17 when he tried to kill himself at his family home last June.His mother managed to save his life by performing CPR, but the Barnard Castle teenager has been in a coma since.George's family recently launched a charity - I'm George's Mate - hoping to fund "suicide peers" in schools across the country.Ahead of the charity's first festival in May, George's parents Hilary Rabbet and David Smith shared their story in the hope of preventing a "potential pandemic" of youth suicide.
"George was tall, very handsome and a very personable young man with everything going for him," Ms Rabbet said, describing the day that changed her family's life irrevocably."Unfortunately, he lost two friends within 18 months and did not get over the deaths, which hit him extremely hard."I spent as much time as I could with him, trying to support him, but on the day in question we'd had a disagreement."I left him in the house on his own while I went shopping, came back and found him."George's mother performed CPR until paramedics arrived and managed to find a pulse.He was airlifted to Middlesbrough's James Cook University Hospital where his family were told he had 24 hours to live.
George had suffered a life-threatening brain injury but, 10 months later, is making slow and steady progress in emerging from a comatose state.Cared for at Newcastle's Walkergate Park facility, George - now 18 - has recently started to communicate through blinking.Mr Smith said: "We're hugely hopeful."There is no definite prognosis and there may not be one for years, but from where he was to where he is is a definite improvement and we hope that continues."
The impact of George's suicide attempt has been enormous for his loved ones, from physical and emotional exhaustion to job losses and grief-inspired illness."It's a devastating experience," his mother said."It is exhausting and you may feel for us, but you can never imagine the trauma we're going through. We can't live a normal life."We need to be with George and there for his therapies and to do as much nursing care as possible - it all makes daily living and routines impossible."Despite their difficulties, George's parents are determined to do all they can to prevent other young people suffering as he did.
Inspired by the love and support shown to them by George's army of friends, the family has launched I'm George's Mate.Offering support and advice, the charity is creating a suicide prevention course for schools."It was born when I was talking to George's friends," Ms Rabbet said."I was telling them they need to support each other, to make sure none of them end up in a hospital bed."We came to the conclusion that we had something wider to get across - we want people to understand young suicide and not brush youth mental health aside as existential angst."There is a real issue and I believe it could become a pandemic if not dealt with."Mr Smith added: "We hope George would approve, it's something that has arisen from the hope he and his friends have given us."It has not risen from despair, but from the determination that the desperation he felt is not something they should ever have to experience."
The upcoming George's Friendfest, taking place on 4 May at TCR Hub in Barnard Castle, was inspired by the teenager's love of festivals and is the latest in a series of charitable events in his honour.George's family speak to him regularly about what is being done in his name."We hope the things we tell him will inspire him to get better," his father said.To other teenagers who may feel as desperate as their son once did, Ms Rabett and Mr Smith had this to say: "Talk to your friends, talk to your family."If you can't talk to them, talk to someone else you trust."There is always someone willing to listen, you are never alone."
