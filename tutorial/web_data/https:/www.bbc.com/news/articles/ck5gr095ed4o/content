The largest lavender farm in the UK has seen an early blooming of its purple fields. The family farm in Kent grows over 130 acres (53 hectares) of lavender and welcomes visitors each year for tours and picnics.Lorna Roberts from Castle Farm in Shoreham, near Sevenoaks, said: "The season is well underway with the lavender flowering very early this year following a mild winter."We have been busy hand-cutting bunches of lavender for drying."
Around 30,000 bunches of lavender are cut every year.The farm, which was established in 1892, began to produce essential oils from the flower in 1998. Ms Roberts said the picnic events will run until the late July before the team begin harvesting their "precious essential oils".
