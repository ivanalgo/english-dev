Fish merchants in Plymouth are working with trawler owners to revive the fish market which closed in May.Plymouth Fishing and Seafood Association (PFSA) is hoping to raise £400,000 to restart the market as a co-operative.Edward Baker, chief executive of the PFSA, said: "We've got a basic business plan together, we think it's a model that works."Site owner Sutton Harbour said it was in discussion with a number of interested parties.
Plymouth Trawler Agents, which ran the fish market for 30 years, held its last auction on 17 May and expressed "regret and sadness" at its closure.The closure meant that trawlers and merchants had to move to Brixham or Newlyn, costing them money in transport.Edward Baker, chief executive of the PFSA, said trawler owners and merchants were being asked to become part of a co-operative "so fishermen are investing in themselves"."Merchants are desperate for it, it really is their livelihood," he said."Our aim is to support the fishermen who need a fish market here."Plymouth has a reputation for top quality fish and we will modernise the way the market is run and the promotion of top quality fish."
Fish trader Ricky Down, who has had to go to Brixham to buy fish, costing him about £500 a week in travel alone, said: "You need a market here."It makes financial sense to put in the effort to get a co-operative together."Rob Goodacre, director of merchants RG Seafoods, said reaction had been "positive all around".He added: "The proof of the pudding will be what they can put in."I'm pretty sure it's achievable."The numbers are there, we've just got to put it all together and if everybody's involved there's no reason why it can't work."
Plymouth City Council said it had been "working closely" with the PFSA and the industry "to sort the immediate issues following the sudden closure of the fish market".This included the offer of match funding for a study into future options for the market and help with grants.
