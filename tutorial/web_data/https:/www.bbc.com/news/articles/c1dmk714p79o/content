A collection of miniature miners inspired by the work of artist Norman Cornish has gone on show in his home town.Twenty-two figures, each standing 3ft high (90cm), are on display at the Bob Abley Gallery in Spennymoor Town Hall, in County Durham.They were created by the late Terry Parks, who was inspired by meeting Cornish when studying art.Cornish, known as the last of the "Pitman Painters", spent 33 years in the mines before forging a career as an artist.
Following Mr Parks' death earlier this year at the age of 89, it was decided the papier mache figures could be displayed at the museum which has a number of items by Cornish and other works linked to County Durham's coalfields.
Michael Hanwell, Mr Parks' grandson, said: "Since I was little, these figures were placed all over my grandfather’s house."Every windowsill had one or two, displayed for his own enjoyment and for us as a family. I don’t think he'd ever considered exhibiting them publicly."It was only after he died that it struck us how many of the figures he'd created and how impressive they looked when displayed together."
Mr Parks, originally from Trimdon, worked as a hewer at Fishburn Colliery from the age of 18 to 29 before becoming an art teacher in Hartlepool.Each figure was based on a person he knew. Many depict hewers at the coalface and mirror Mr Parks' experiences.Gallery manager John Thompson said the works "fit perfectly" with the permanent exhibits on show.He added: "The fact Mr Parks himself was such a Cornish fan, even drawing inspiration from his style and work, makes it even more special."The figures will be on show for three months.
