Ms Ramage said she was worried the council had "jumped the gun" by allowing a dog in the school without sufficient protections in place.She said: "We need to think about duty of care to all staff and pupils. We have children too with severe allergies.‚ÄùThe council introduced dogs in schools to benefit pupils in academic environments.The policy requires a staff member to be the "responsible owner".
