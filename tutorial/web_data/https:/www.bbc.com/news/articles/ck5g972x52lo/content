The Environment Agency (EA) has invested more than £37,000 into 10 local fishing projects in Devon and Cornwall.In total, £37,117 has been injected through the Fisheries Improvement Programme in 2023-2024, a spokesperson for the EA has confirmed.The projects range from improving fisheries habitats, enhancing angling club facilities and managing fisheries in response to a changing climate.James Wimpress, an Environment Agency project manager, said: "Money from rod licence sales is put back where it came from to improve the experience of anglers, protect fish stocks and improve the environment."
He continued: "This investment unlocks funding from partners which creates even more benefits."But none of this would happen without the hard work of everyone who volunteers to improve their angling club premises. "Their actions improve the environment for everyone."This includes Bideford Angling Club, which experiences problems with dissolved oxygen levels in their lakes during warm summer months. The Tarka Swims aeration project, also in Bideford, introduced a solar-powered aeration system into the fishery which the EA supported with £2,160.Roche Angling Club has ambitions to replace several fishing platforms at Wheal Rashleigh in Cornwall.This project was supported by £4,575 from the EA. The platforms help keep anglers safe, stabilise banks and make angling more accessible.The full list of schemes supported by the Environment Agency’s Fisheries Improvement Programme are:
