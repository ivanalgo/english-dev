An Isle of Man medieval clock is set to be removed from its clock tower for conservation work.Although the current clock face at Castle Rushen in Castletown was put in place in the 1980s, the timepiece’s mechanism dates back to the 16th Century.It will be removed for refurbishment, while the Clock Room roof and floor at the castle will also undergo repairs, Manx National Heritage said.Conservator Christopher Weeks said the work would help protect the clock and the tower for the future.
It will help prevent water ingress, including repairs to the building's roof and floor.The heritage body said the clock had undergone “significant changes and restoration during its lifetime”, and was last removed for repairs in 2011, being refitted five years later. As part of the latest work, the clock mechanism itself will be cleaned before being put back in place later this year.
Mr Weeks said the clock's removal would “open the next chapter in Castle Rushen’s history”. “The first step is removal of the 16th Century mechanism for the specialist   programme of works to be carried out, which will safeguard the clock on a long-term basis, as well as protecting and preserving its home at Castle Rushen,” he added.Work on the project is expected to last until the autumn, when the clock will be returned to the building.
