A fire service in West Sussex is offering the chance to win its services for a day.Firefighters from Chichester Fire Station will help a community group or charity with any unfinished project.The chosen project would need to be completed within a day and all the materials must be provided to the crew.Station manager Anton Mezzone said: “We are keen to hear from anyone within the district who may have hit a brick wall with a project and are in need of some free labour.”
For those looking to enter the competition, a 250-word explanation about the project and how the crew could help needs to be submitted to West Sussex County Council.Projects may include decorating a community space, repair work to a community asset or renovating a garden.Mr Mezzone said the crew will have access to all of the tools carried on the fire engine that they are trained to use.“We know there are a lot of community groups, charities and local organisations that have some great ideas to improve their communities for people living and working in those communities, but they may not have the resources to carry these works out,” he said.
