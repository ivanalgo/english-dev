Disruption is expected as the space for queuing at the Torpoint ferry crossings is being reduced during a 12-week refurbishment set to begin later this month.Tamar Crossings said it expected "increased congestion" during the project to refurbish the traffic light gantries starting on 17 June.The equipment on the steel gantries is used to control and monitor traffic into the queuing lanes and onto the ferry slipways on both sides of the river.Tamar Crossings said the work, funded by itself and Cornwall Council, follows a survey that found the structure's protective topcoat was severely weathered.
The first phase on the A374 at Torpoint and the traffic marshalling area at Devonport is set to take place from 17 June to 26 July, followed by the second phase scheduled for 4 September and 11 October.Andrew Vallance, from Tamar Crossings, said there would be restricted queuing capacity for the full period.He said: "Whilst we recognise that the reduction in queuing capacity in the lanes is likely to create increased congestion in the immediate vicinity of the works, and potentially impact on the wider local road network at certain times, these measures are essential to provide access for the works and manage the safety of the public."We will be working closely with contractors and key stakeholders, including Plymouth City Council, Cornwall Council and Torpoint Town Council, transport providers and emergency services throughout the project to keep disruption to a minimum."
