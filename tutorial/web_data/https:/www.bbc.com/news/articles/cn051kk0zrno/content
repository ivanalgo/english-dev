A legal order has been put in place for three years to tackle anti-social behaviour in an area of north Derbyshire.The public space protection order covers Clay Cross, Old Tupton, Holmgate and Danesmoor, until July 2027.North East Derbyshire District Council approved the order, which would give Derbyshire Police greater powers to stop people consuming alcohol in public and issue on-the-spot fines of up to £100.It would also be an offence for someone there to have, in public, a container believed to contain alcohol.
Officers can demand people surrender the items if they believe anti-social behaviour has occurred, or is likely to.The order is also intended to crack down on people using intoxicating substances in public and behaviour which could cause harassment or distress to the public including the use of e-scooters.People loitering in council housing blocks and retail premises, who officers believe could cause or likely to cause anti-social behaviour, could also be fined.In addition to the on-the-spot fines, officers could also take rule-breakers to court where fines of up to £1,000 could be handed out.Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
