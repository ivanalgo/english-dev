People are being advised to “never touch anything” they find near Lincolnshire's weapon ranges.The Ministry of Defence (MoD) operates ranges at Holbeach, Wainfleet and Donna Nook. In places, they can be accessed by the public.Safety bosses at the sites said unexploded ordnance - which still pose a threat to life - can come in a variety of shapes and sizes.The warning follows incidents of bombs and bullets being found along the east coast.
Maj (Retd) Tim Stearne, from East Coast MoD Air Weapons Ranges, said people should “respect the range” when visiting.He warned old bombs or bullets could lurk underground and they “come in all shapes and sizes”.“It could look like a rusty can, but it could still be dangerous,” he said.
Earlier in the year Lincolnshire Police received reports a man had entered a prohibited area of the Holbeach range on a moped.A 57-year-old man was later summonsed to Boston Magistrates’ Court charged with contravening a byelaw.Mr Stearne said he understood people can be “curious” added ranges are “very dangerous” places.“Do not go on the range when the flags are up and the lights are on,” he said.
Keith Arnold, a training safety marshal at the Donna Nook range, said he was aware of one person who took an item containing explosive ordnance found on the range.“They then tried to sell it online,” he said. "It could have had a serious outcome, we had to get the police involved."Unexploded ordnance was also found on a beach in Mablethorpe in April. The Mablethorpe Coastguard said the bomb was destroyed in a controlled explosion.Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
