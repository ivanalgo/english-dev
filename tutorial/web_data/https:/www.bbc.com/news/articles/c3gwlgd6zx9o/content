A police watchdog says many of the problem areas it identified at West Midlands Police (WMP) have been addressed.His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) raised concerns in four areas in December, including how the force managed the risk from sex offenders.WMP was subsequently put into special measures but in the latest update inspectors said there had been "sustained improvements", and three causes of concern were closed.The BBC has contacted West Midlands Police for comment. The region's police and crime commissioner said he was "pleased" with the improvements .
In December, HMICFRS said West Midlands Police had failed to:The only cause of concern that was not closed in the update, published on Tuesday,  was in relation to investigations leading to satisfactory results for victims."I recognise the effort the force is making to resolve this outstanding cause of concern and will review the force’s progress later this year," said HM inspector Lee Freeman.
The report found that the force, which covers Birmingham, Wolverhampton, the Black Country and Coventry, effectively managed registered sex offenders, and that more resources had been allocated to this work. It added that the force needed to "better understand" how digital tools were used  to detect offending, and that it should ensure sex offenders ordered to be monitored online were complying with this condition.Inspectors said the force had addressed increased demand for support from its online child sexual exploitation team, and reduced its backlog.The force was uploading more pictures to the national child abuse image database, however it needed to continue to monitor the wellbeing of those who viewed the images in their work.
Finally, it said the force had successfully addressed the backlog of high-risk cases for discussion at multi-agency risk assessment conferences.These are meetings where police and other local organisations share information about someone at high risk of domestic abuse, and produce an action plan to increase their safety.However, inspectors added that the force needed to ensure that other organisations in the meetings understood their purpose.
West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, Simon Foster, said he was pleased with the action taken by the force, and would continue to hold it to account."I am committed to constant and unremitting action, to ensure the people of the West Midlands receive the service from West Midlands Police, that they are entitled to," he added.
