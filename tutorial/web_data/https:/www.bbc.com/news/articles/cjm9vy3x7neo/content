A giant plant-based Pudsey bear is set to make its return to the RHS Flower Show at Tatton Park 21 years after it first featured. The bear was the creation of plant and flower nursery, E. Smith and Son, based in Lymm in Cheshire, and appeared in the BBC North West Tonight garden in 2003.But since late founder, Edwin Smith, created it the frame for the Children In Need mascot display had been left to the elements behind a shed. His son, Derek Smith, has got Pudsey in shape and it is ready to feature again this year. 
Edwin died in 2018, but his son said he would have been "absolutely made up" to see his creation back in Tatton. Mr Smith told the BBC: "We have kept him all these years never knowing that we would ever use him again. "But it's really fantastic to get him out and get him replanted."He said Pudsey's metal frame had been "hiding behind the shed" for the past two decades and had not been "well-looked after". However, Mr Smith said it was still in good shape which was "testament to the work of my father". 
After a call from a BBC producer about five weeks ago, he said his enthusiasm was "re-fired" and the beloved bear was rescued and re-planted. Despite the challenges of such a short time-frame, the bear is now in fine shape thanks to Mr Smith's staff, including his daughter, Rachel. Rachel, who tried her best to help as a toddler in 2003, said her grandad "would have been thrilled" to see the bear back on display. Mr Smith said his father did "lots of fantastic things" for the Tatton show over the years. "His legacy lives on in Pudsey," he added. The show's 25th anniversary event takes place from 17 July.
