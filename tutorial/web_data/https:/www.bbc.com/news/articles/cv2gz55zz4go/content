Some might say July is a little early to start mentioning Christmas - but Allan and Sharon Evans are definitely not among them.The couple from Porthcawl, Bridgend county, have been spreading festive magic for more than six years, raising £60,000 for charities along the way.Now they have officially been inducted into the UK Santa Claus Hall of Fame for their efforts.But what really goes into becoming one of the country's very best Santas?
Through good times and bad - including the sudden death of a friend and cancer diagnoses - the couple have strived to spread good cheer."I want to do the best I can, I'm always trying to learn. It's a lovely feeling when you see both the kids and the adults have had a good time," said Allan."I try to be good all year round, because I know there's a list."You've got to be kind, I think kids especially recognise that."There have been days when I've been down and just seeing the expression on kids' faces, it just lifts you up as well. So it's like a two-way interaction, but you've got to be a good listener."
The journey began back in 2017, when Allan, a tax adviser at Tata Steel, received a phone call from a colleague, asking if he would be Santa for the company's Christmas parties."I've absolutely no idea why he thought I'd be any good," he said with a chuckle as he stroked his white beard.After a few "warm-up gigs" and the parties, he became Steelworks Santa, received lots of positive feedback and was considering doing it again the following year.But, in 2018, his colleague Alex Kalinik died suddenly a week before his wedding, sparking Allan's fundraising goals."Alex absolutely adored Christmas," said Allan."His funeral was Christmas themed, and Father Christmas attended."His parents said Alex would have been over the moon to know his hero had been at his funeral."From there, Allan, 63, and Sharon, 58, started doing a variety of events, such as photo shoots, breakfast with Santa, tea with Santa and Christmas grottos.This year, he has even been asked to be involved in a Seaside Santa shoot, bringing the festivities forward.They pick a UK and a local charity each year, and started with British Heart Foundation in memory of Alex.Other causes to benefit over the years include Sandville Self Help Foundation, Alzheimer's Society Cymru and Hope Rescue.
It soon became a family affair.Their daughter Katie, known as Santa's chief elf Candy Cane, as well as 14-year-old granddaughter Serena who plays Jingleberry, head elf in training, and grandson Harrison, 11 - head of security at the coal department - got into the spirit too."Everyone plays a part to try and spread the Christmas cheer," said Allan.Allan and Sharon both have custom-made suits from a local seamstress."I wanted to have a suit that was different, so hopefully people put their hands in their pockets and donate to the charities we were supporting."She's had requests to make suits for other people, but she says she's a one Santa woman."Enquiries start coming in as early as February, which is also when Allan starts growing the famous Santa beard, after the "de-Santafication process" on Christmas Eve to spend January "back to Allan".He said he doesn't feel any pressure to look the part, because it is a "pleasure to keep it up".
Allan has a lot of highlights from over the years, in particular enjoying a Santa Paws photo shoot with dogs of all sizes. But his favourite tales are of special moments with the young people he interacts with."One boy came in and he said 'Santa, when you're going home to the North Pole, when you're flying through the sky, can you wave to my mum who's in heaven’' "Things like that melt me."He recalled another happy customer, who had Down's syndrome, asking Santa to find his mum a boyfriend, only to return the following year with a step-dad, step-brother and step-sister.When Covid lockdowns stopped in-person events from taking place, Allan learned how to make and edit videos, from a fellow Santa in the Santa's Workshop UK network, and created more than 200 individualised recordings."I think since the pandemic, people have changed a bit and they look forward to things a lot more now."I always seem to be in Christmas mode."
Sharon, who works in retail, has a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), a rare and incurable type of cancer in the digestive system, for which she has chemotherapy treatment at home.In 2021, she was also diagnosed with breast cancer, which meant she needed two surgeries, and she is also awaiting a knee replacement due to arthritis."She's had a lot thrown at her," said Allan."But she was adamant that we keep going because it's important, not just for us but for other people that follow us as well."Allan and Sharon were jointly recognised by Santa's Workshop UK, which inducted them into its Hall of Fame last month.Allan said he was "blindsided" by the honour, because he often feels imposter syndrome around the role."To have joint recognition for myself and Sharon, I think that's brilliant because that's really what it's about. We support each other."Sammy Brooks, one of the organisation's founders, said it was an easy decision, adding: "I've never come across a couple before with hearts as real and true as actual Santa himself."Allan added: "Christmas is a special time of year. When I'm talking to families, I always ask what the most important part is for them, and they always come up with spending time with family - as well as the decorations and presents."It's a feeling, and I think if we could wrap that feeling up and keep it with us all year round, the world would be a much better place."
