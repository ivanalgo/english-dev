An invasive plant which can become "uncontrollable" has been found in more parts of Guernsey.Officials said there had been sightings of Himalayan balsam around the island.Agriculture, Countryside and Land Management Services (ACLMS) said the plant - which can reach 3m (9.8ft) in height and has pods which can explode seeds up to 7m (22.9ft) away - was difficult to remove once it grows.It said removing the plant in its early stages of growth was "critical" to prevent it affecting Guernsey's biodiversity.
ACLMS said Himalayan balsam can "smother the land and outcompete native plant species" once it starts to grow.It said work had been conducted over the past three years to remove the non-native plant from the island.The plant has not returned to areas where it was removed previously, but new sightings elsewhere have been reported, the agency said."Thousands of these unwanted plants have been removed over the last three years," it said."Without this intervention, the species could have become uncontrollable, leading to huge impacts on Guernsey's local wildlife and biodiversity as it smothers the land and outcompetes native plant species."The Himalayan balsam is identified by large, pink flowers shaped like a bonnet, which are followed by hanging, green seed pods, the Wildlife Trust said.
Francis Russell, from the ACLMS non-native invasive species team, said the plant spreads "alarmingly easily"."As an annual plant it is quite distinctive and very easy to remove before it spreads hundreds of seeds," he said."We really don't want to see this species becoming established in Guernsey as it spreads alarmingly easily and will become a significant problem for our natural spaces and for landowners."
