A charity has appealed for members of the public to report wildlife crimes after the bodies of four young swans were found.The Canal & River Trust believes the cygnets may have been killed by a pellet gun or catapult.They were found on 18 July along the Wyrley and Essington Canal in Walsall.West Midlands Police has been contacted for comment.
“Canals are a haven for wildlife, places where people can get close to our amazing natural world without fear, and the place where many of us see our first swans, ducks, dragonflies or even an otter," said Paul Wilkinson, senior ecologist at the trust."But our nature is under threat - it’s incredibly upsetting that our iconic waterway cygnets have seemingly been killed in these senseless attacks. "Cruelty to animals can’t be tolerated, it is a crime and needs to be addressed, and we are working with the West Midlands Police and local community to prevent it happening again."
