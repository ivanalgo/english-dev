Plans for a new restaurant and play area on an East Sussex seafront have been approved.Lewes District Council said in its application that the project at Newhaven West Beach, near Newhaven Fort, will “re-invigorate the beach front and boost tourism in the area”, as well as “preserve the significance of Newhaven Fort and enhance its setting”.Some structures will be demolished to make way for two single-storey buildings, one housing the restaurant, the other toilets and changing facilities. The rest of the space will be used for an indoor gym and children’s wet play area.The Local Democracy Reporting Service report that just one resident objected to the plans, saying the development would not generate the number of visitors needed to make it financial viable.
Chris Barker, a council planning agent, said: “The proposal is clearly landscape-led, seeking to enhance the setting of this beautiful location and to bring more local residents and tourists to the area to utilise the West Beach of Newhaven and boost the economy of the area.”Some council committee members did, however, raise concerns about the layout, security and management of the project, however these were not considered to be significant impediments to the scheme.There will be a large car parking area with 55 spaces.
