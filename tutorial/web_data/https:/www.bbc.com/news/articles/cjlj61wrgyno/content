A man who secretly filmed himself carrying out indecent acts near or behind women has been jailed for two-and-a-half years.Lewis Spencer of Congleton, Cheshire, was arrested after being caught recording himself on the first day of a new job, carrying out a sexual act behind a co-worker without her knowledge. Seventeen videos of similar sexual offences against women were found on the phone of Spencer who admitted to five counts of sexual assault, seven counts of exposure and possession of extreme pornography.The 23-year-old, who was sentenced at Chester Crown Court on Tuesday, was also placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely.
The offences against a number of women happened across Congleton and Macclesfield in December 2023, said Cheshire Police.Spencer was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault on 28 December, two days after his first shift at a business in Macclesfield.His victim had reported that his behaviour made her feel uncomfortable, and a check of CCTV showed him carrying out a sexual act behind her.From the recordings of similar offences on Spencer's phone, officers were able to identify another two victims, who had previously worked with him, but some of his other victims could not be identified from the footage.
"Spencer is an incredibly dangerous and perverse individual who preyed on innocent and unwitting women who were simply going about their daily lives," said Det Insp Robert Lees."He was surreptitious in his actions, with his victims having no idea of the depraved acts he was carrying out," stated the officer."His behaviour is completely unacceptable, and I'm glad he's being held accountable for his actions behind bars, where he can no longer pose a threat to women," he added.
