A 17-year-old girl is hoping she can lead the England men's football team in the next World Cup after applying for the vacant manager's position.Isabelle, from Crowle, has sent an application to replace Gareth Southgate, who stood down two days after defeat in the 2024 European Championship final.She said she would use her experience of coaching grassroots teams to develop the players and improve their self-belief.The Football Association (FA) said the ideal candidate will "lead and develop the team to win a major tournament and be consistently ranked as one of the top teams in the world".
Isabelle, who is also an avid showjumper, said she decided to put an application in after her mum sent a picture to her family's group chat."They might turn around and say 'you've not got what we're looking for' but anything is possible," she said."I don't have a UEFA pro licence but I told the FA they could help me get one and I've not managed a Premier League team but I talked about the skills I have to develop the players."I've managed teams before and have done coaching at college. I also told them how I'd have changed the squad for the Euro final."Isabelle told the BBC she would have started Cole Palmer instead of Harry Kane in the Euro final against Spain and would "maybe" have changed the formation."When I was younger I played football but I snapped my wrist at school and stopped playing as much. I prefer the coaching side because I enjoy it a lot more anyway."With coaching, I enjoy seeing people put their skills to the test and help them adapt to get better. People who might not think they're good, I'll encourage them and help others make friends in the sport."Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.
