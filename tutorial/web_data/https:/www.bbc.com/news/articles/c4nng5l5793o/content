Campaigners say the reduction of their local bus service in Somerset has been "devastating" following the introduction of a new timetable.The number 25 service from Taunton to Dulverton via Wiveliscombe was saved from being cut in February, but campaigners have criticised the new timetable.The Wivey Bus User Group says the bus no longer runs at some of the most busy and popular times.Operator Buses of Somerset said it is conducting a "comprehensive review" of the route.
In February, the 25 service was saved from being dropped completely following a campaign from locals to keep it.But for some residents, the celebrations were short lived when they saw the reduction in the bus timetable.Some residents have also criticised the reliability of the service.James Morrell used to use the bus get to college but said that became more challenging.He said "I'd occasionally took the buses in the middle of the day but it was always a gamble as to whether they'd actually turn up."James said he also found that the buses were also "very crowded" or they were "20 minutes to half an hour late."
Dave Topham's son has just finished at Richard Huish College, and regularly got the bus between Milverton and Taunton.He said the unreliability of the service meant his son was half an hour late for one of his mock exams because it did not turn up on time.This meant for the rest of his son's A-Levels, Dave and his wife drove the hour-long round trip to every exam to make sure he would get there on time.The Wivey Bus Users Group said: "The impact on students has been particularly stressful and, sometimes, devastating."The group added it was concerned that if fewer people used the bus as a result of the changes this would be used to "justify further cuts".Operator Buses of Somerset said "it is untrue to say that the reduction in service was made to ‘justify’ the route being cut completely. "The 25 route was one of four services that faced potential cuts, and adjustments were made to save the service and ensure its continued operation."It said it continually assesses its services and is working with the Somerset Bus Partnership and Somerset Council to conduct "a comprehensive review" of the route.
