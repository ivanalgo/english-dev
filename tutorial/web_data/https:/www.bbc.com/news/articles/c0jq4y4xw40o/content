Revised plans have been submitted for a major village housing development of up to 587 homes.Middlesbrough Council is being asked to consider proposals for a 44-hectare (106-acre) site at Stainton Vale Farm, owned by Bellway.The developer said it would help address the town’s housing needs, however concerns have been raised over increased congestion and a "lack of amenity" in the area.The developer said the proposals, which will be considered by the council in due course, had been revised to respond to community comments.
A previous masterplan for the site was unveiled at a public consultation in the summer of 2023.Concerns raised at the event included a loss of green space and wildlife habitats and a large number of new-build homes in the area.Stainton and Thornton ward councillor David Coupe said: "From what I can see you are going to have 500 houses as a little isolated community. "Yes, there is the Sporting Lodge but that’s going to be it – no shops, no anything."
Some residents also said it would increase road congestion, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.The land is hemmed in by Low Lane to the south, the A19 to the west and the A174 to the north. The new homes would be accessed via Low Lane with a new crossing for Stainton Beck and a new roundabout on Low Lane.Mr Coupe said: "If you add up the proposed development at Hemlington Grange where you’ve got another 150-odd houses going in Larchfields, then you’ve got the potential 1,000 houses going at Coulby, that’s a heck of a lot of traffic to go along that area."
In response to Mr Coupe’s concerns, a spokesperson for Bellway said the application detailed how the development would "connect to the neighbouring residential areas, as well as the highways improvements that would be made".Bellway said it took feedback from the council and the community on board before submitting the planning application.Martyn Earle, strategic land director for Bellway Strategic Land, said: "We have proposed a scheme which would provide ecological benefits, great transport connections and a boost to the local economy through job creation.”The developer also noted the development would generate an estimated £663,000 in council tax each year.
