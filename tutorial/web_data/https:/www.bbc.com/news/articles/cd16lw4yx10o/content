Asylum seekers housed at a "prison-like" former RAF base had to queue for food and experienced scabies outbreaks, the High Court has been told.Four ex-residents of MDP Wethersfield, near Braintree, in Essex, are taking legal action against the Home Office, claiming it acted unlawfully by housing them at the site.Barristers for the men, who all stayed at the former airbase between July 2023 and February 2024, claimed the accommodation was "seriously inadequate".The Home Office has opposed the challenge, and said there were "ongoing improvements" to address concerns.
It has admitted that housing one of the men at the site was unlawful, but said this was an "individual error" and the base "reasonably appeared adequate" for the other three individuals.The men have argued the site was "not suitable" for them because of their circumstances, which included being victims of torture and human trafficking.
At a hearing on Tuesday, Angus McCullough KC said Wethersfield was "unsuitable for those who are vulnerable".He told the court in London that the Home Office was "ineffective in detecting those who are vulnerable".The then-Conservative government announced plans to house migrants at Wethersfield, as well as RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, in March 2023.Migrants began to be housed at Wethersfield in July 2023, with capacity capped at 580 - despite initial plans to accommodate 1,700 people.Mr McCullough said the four men described the base as "prison-like", with sounds of gunfire from a nearby shooting range triggering "traumatic memories".He continued that the fixed meal times meant there were "queues to receive food and fighting between asylum seekers as a result".While laundry was done centrally, there were "recurring episodes of scabies", he added.
Lisa Giovannetti KC, representing the Home Office, said in written arguments that potential residents were subject to interviews where vulnerabilities could be disclosed.She continued that while the Home Office "expressly recognises" that individuals may not immediately disclose vulnerabilities, the system was "capable of being operated lawfully".Ms Giovannetti continued that the criticisms of accommodation at Wethersfield did not make the site "generally inadequate" and that there were "ongoing improvements" to address concerns.The hearing, before Mr Justice Mould, is due to end on Friday, with a judgment expected in writing at a later date.
