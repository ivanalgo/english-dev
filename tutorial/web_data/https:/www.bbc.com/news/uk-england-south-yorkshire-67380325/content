More than 50 roads in South Yorkshire could be shut to traffic to allow a motor rally to take place next month.
Sheffield and Hallamshire Motor Club has requested the closures for the race on Sunday 10 December.
The event, with around 120 competitors, would affect a number of routes in Penistone, Cawthorne, Wortley and Stocksbridge.
Barnsley Council's cabinet is expected to decide whether to authorise the closures at a meeting on Wednesday.
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, councillor James Higginbottom said: "Our primary responsibility is to ensure the safety and well-being of our community.
"The decision to approve or object will come with careful consideration and assessments on whether the event can be carried out safely and successfully."
The Sheffield and Hallamshire Motor Club is one of the oldest clubs in the country, tracing its origins back to 1902.
The club said the rally would "comprise four special stages using minor roads in predominantly low populated areas. 
"The loop of stages will be run twice, once in the morning and once in the afternoon."
It described the rally as a "never to be forgotten experience" for spectators.
