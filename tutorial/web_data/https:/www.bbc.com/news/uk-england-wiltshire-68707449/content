A town's former Lloyds Bank building will be transformed into a boutique hotel.
The Grade II listed building in Corsham, Wiltshire, dates back to the early-mid 18th Century and closed as a Lloyds Bank in 2016.
Plans approved by Wiltshire Council include a wine merchant, restaurant and bar.
The application says the hotel will "provide job and training opportunities" for Corsham residents.
The new hotel is due to be operated by the Beckford Group, which has restaurants across Somerset and Wiltshire, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
A heritage statement said the High Street building had a "fascinating architectural history".
"Its unique character is the result of the way in which it has been subtly adapted to serve successive uses over the centuries," it said.
According to the plans, the historic central staircase will remain maintained andÂ the new hotel rooms on the upper floors will be based on the historic layouts.
The application says the hotel will "provide new high quality visitor accommodation in Corsham".
