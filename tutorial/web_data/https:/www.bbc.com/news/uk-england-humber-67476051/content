Two broadband poles which were recently installed in Hull have been cut down.
The poles in the Longhill area of the city were felled, prompting telecoms company MS3 Networks to issue a warning about the dangers of damaging the structures.
MS3 has been installing poles in parts of East Yorkshire in recent weeks, with the work prompting anger in some communities.
Humberside Police said officers were investigating both incidents.
A force spokesperson said it had received reports of poles on Waveney Road being damaged at about 20:00 GMT on Friday.
They added that officers were looking at CCTV footage in an attempt to identify those involved.
Changes to the law since April 2022 mean operators can erect poles without having to apply to councils for planning permission.
In Hull and East Yorkshire, campaigners have accused MS3 Networks of "littering" streets with the telegraph poles.
In a statement MS3 said: "Telegraph poles weigh hundreds of kilograms and there is very real danger of loss of life from deliberately damaging them.
"Whilst the police investigation is under way we cannot comment on the act itself however we are extremely disappointed with the actions of members of local protest groups condoning this behaviour online."
The firm added that it believed the "harassment" faced by its staff when they installed the poles and "misinformation posted online" had led to "a small group of individuals deciding to commit a serious offence that may have endangered lives".
