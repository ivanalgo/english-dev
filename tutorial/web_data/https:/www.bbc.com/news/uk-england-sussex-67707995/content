Council leaders are to pursue a short-term contract for Bexhill's ageing leisure facilities to allow time to consider the sites' future options.
Bexhill Leisure Centre and Leisure Pool need "significant capital investment", according to Rother District Council.
A two-year contract with Freedom Leisure will allow the council to look at next steps for the sites.
They could need more than £2.1m investment or face "major trouble" according to a senior councillor.
On Monday Rother District Council's cabinet agreed that the authority could seek a new contract with Freedom Leisure, up to April 2026 following the end of the current one.
The council has already agreed to set aside £60,000 for minor improvements at the facilities during this new contract period.
Hazel Timpe from Rother District Council, whose cabinet portfolio includes leisure, told councillors the new contract would be on the same terms as the current one, with no revenue cost to the council but with some investment needed for improvements to fixtures and fittings.
She added: "Without significant capital investment from the council, these facilities are going to be in major trouble. 
"We must have a short-term two-year contract with Freedom Leisure to allow us to look at the future of these sites and, if required, secure a long-term sustainable operator to manage the council's leisure facilities."
In a report to cabinet, officers said continuing to run the facilities without the investment needed would significantly impact the council's ability to procure a contract of meaningful length in the future, and risked increasing costs and providing a poor service.
