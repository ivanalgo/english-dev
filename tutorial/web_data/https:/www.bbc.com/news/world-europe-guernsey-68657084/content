A mother and daughter are walking 100km (62 miles) across Guernsey to pay tribute to a family member who died from ovarian cancer.
Helen Deane's sister Ruth died of ovarian cancer in 2009, two weeks before Ruth was 30 years old.
Helen and her 11-year-old daughter Aurora have raised Â£1,100 so far through the Walk In Her Name, for Ovarian Cancer Action.
Funding for ovarian cancer research "just isn't there", Ms Deane said.
"The research isn't there, which means that the chances of survival, unless you are very lucky, are very low," she said.
She added they both wanted to raise awareness of the disease as March was Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.
Ovarian cancer can be difficult to detect because the symptoms are frequently associated with other, less serious illnesses, Ovarian Cancer Action said.
The charity added the main symptoms were - persistent stomach pain, persistent bloating, difficulty eating and feeling full more quickly, and needing to urinate more frequently.
Ovarian Cancer Action recommend women who experience the symptoms to see their doctor.
