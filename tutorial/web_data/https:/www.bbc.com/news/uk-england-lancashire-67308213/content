A university will get electricity from a new solar farm and hot water from heat pumps as it aims to offer a carbon neutral campus.
Lancaster University has been allocated £21m from a government green energy fund to decarbonise its buildings.
It will use a low-carbon heating system, with wind turbines providing energy for the heat pumps.
Professor Simon Guy said the university aimed to be "among the best in the world" for sustainability.  
"Our students want to go out into the world to make a difference - what better start to that ambition than a world-class university education which is mindful of the planet and places sustainability at the heart of its decision making," he said.  
It is one of five projects to receive a share of £65m from the Green Heat Network Fund, which is part of the government's commitment to reduce carbon emissions.
It wants to decarbonise the housing stock by moving buildings away from fossil fuels.
Heat pumps collect energy from an external source - whether air, ground or water - and are considered to be more efficient than gas boilers.
At the university, a new solar farm and existing wind turbine will supply electricity for the heat pumps.
Lord Callanan, minister for energy efficiency and green finance, said: "I hope other universities can follow Lancaster's lead by using renewable energy from solar and wind to power this impressive heat network, allowing them to decarbonise their campus."
