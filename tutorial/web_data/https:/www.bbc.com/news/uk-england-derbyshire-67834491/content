A proposed 90-home development in Derby has led to concerns over traffic and increased pressure on local services.
Miller Homes has applied to Derby City Council for permission to build the new homes near Royal Hill Road in Spondon. 
The application has attracted about 70 objections so far and about 85 people attended a public meeting to discuss the development. 
Miller Homes said the "high-quality design" homes would bring economic benefits to the area. 
But residents fear the roads, schools and local healthcare services will struggle to cope with an influx of extra people. 
They are concerned traffic queues will be worse at peak times in the area around Royal Hill Road, especially as Springfield Primary School, St Werburgh's Primary School and West Park School are nearby.
Spondon councillors Chris Poulter, Jonathan Smale and Nicola Roulstone, who organised the public meeting, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service there were also concerns about pollution and access to local services. 
They stated: "Pollution, especially during construction, is a significant worry for residents, anticipating disruption to the area. 
"Access to local infrastructure, including healthcare services, is a primary concern, with Spondon already stretched to its limits."
Miller Homes said the new homes would have a high-quality design, help the city council meet its "urgent" target to deliver more housing in the city and bring economic benefits.
A planning statement from the developer says: "Land off Royal Hill Road, Spondon, will be a highly desirable place to live, reflecting the desirable elements of the local vernacular.
"The proposals respect the local character but also move the community towards a more sustainable future, through a significant increase in housing choice."
