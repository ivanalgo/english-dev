A resident who was trapped in a building by fire has been rescued by neighbours.
Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service was called at about 02:00 BST to a blaze involving two large linked detached houses in Littleworth near Faringdon.
The person was rescued from an upstairs bedroom window using a ladder, the service said.
No injuries have been reported and the cause of the fire is under investigation.
The first of five fire crews arrived on the scene within seven minutes, the service said.
A spokesperson said: "The properties had working smoke alarms which meant all residents were alerted.
"One resident was trapped in an upstairs bedroom and unable to get out. Quick-thinking neighbours managed to rescue them through the bedroom window."
The service said fire crews would remain on the scene for most of the day, damping down hot spots.
