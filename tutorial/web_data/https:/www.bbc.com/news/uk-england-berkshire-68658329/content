A town is to get its first electric bus fleet after securing Â£4.7m in funding from the government.
Reading Buses will add the 24 double-decker buses to its 17 and 21 routes and install charging infrastructure at its depot.
It follows a successful bid from the Department for Transport's Zero Emissions Bus Regional Area fund.
They will enter service in the next two years, starting with route 17, Reading's most frequently used service.
Reading Buses, which is owned by Reading Borough Council, has been trialling different zero emission vehicles in the last year.
It will add the electric buses to its current fleet of 66 gas vehicles.
Chief executive officer Robert Williams said the new buses would "provide even quieter, smoother journeys for our customers, and demonstrate the significant environmental benefits of switching to public transport".
James Crosbie, assistant director for planning, transport, and public protection, said: "The introduction of 24 electric buses to Reading is very exciting and highlights our commitment to improving air quality and the health of residents in the borough."
He said they would also help reduce carbon emissions in built-up residential areas and help Reading be net zero by 2030.
