A controlled explosion was carried out after a device, thought to be a corroded mortar shell, was found at a nature reserve.
Suffolk police was called to Cavenham Heath Nature Reserve, Tuddenham St Mary, about 15:00 BST on Sunday after a member of public reported the find.
Police said the device was between 3in (8cm) and 4in (10cm) long.
The bomb disposal team from Colchester carried out a controlled explosion just before 19:00, a police spokesman added.
An Army spokesman said the team identified a legacy munition and it was safely destroyed in situ.
"We always advise the public that if they inadvertently disturb what they believe to be live ordnance, they should contact their local police force as a matter of urgency," he added.
