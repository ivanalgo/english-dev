A rugby club is hosting a swab testing session in a bid to try and find a bone marrow match for one of its players.
Old Redcliffians player Ellis Joseph was diagnosed with leukaemia last month and needs to find a stranger with a genetic match for a transplant.
Head coach Dan Cox, said the 26-year-old was in "desperate need of a stem cell donor who will - save his life".
A drive-through swab centre and testing centre have been set up at the rugby club in Brislington in Bristol.
Ellis received his shock diagnosis after experiencing breathlessness and tiredness, which he put down to increased gym sessions as he recovered from a sports injury.
Mr Cox said since then, it has been a "difficult few weeks" for Ellis as he has been in and out of intensive care.
"He's still in good spirits but he's got a tough journey in front of him and we're supporting him," he said.
With only half-siblings, the 26-year-old is looking for a stranger who is a good match.
Mr Cox said trying to find a donor for Ellis had "really galvanised" the rugby community.
"We've been absolutely overwhelmed with celebrities reaching out, famous athletes reaching out," he said.
"Ellis Genge (the England rugby player) and people in the England squad have really banged the drum.
"We put a post out two weeks ago and it's had over 180,000 shares and views, so it's far-reaching. "
With his mixed heritage, doctors have told Ellis that it may make finding a match more difficult.
"In typical Ellis fashion, he's been fantastic and positive," said Mr Cox.
"His opinion of this whole campaign is that even if we get more stem cell donors on the register it might save other people's lives as well - and that's the important part here."
The test and swab centres will be at Old Reds Rugby Club until 17:00 GMT on Saturday.
