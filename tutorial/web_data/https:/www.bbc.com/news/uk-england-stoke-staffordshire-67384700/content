A man who believes kindness is his superpower has been honoured with a statue at Tower Bridge in London.
Sebbie Hall, 20, from Lichfield, saw the statue of himself, wearing a cape and posing in a heroic stance, unveiled on Monday to mark World Kindness Day.
He was honoured after carrying out an act of kindness every day during the Covid-19 pandemic. He has since gone on to support more than 450 families.
The statue will later be taken to its permanent home at The Hub in Lichfield.
Mr Hall has said his acts of kindness were a way of acknowledging the help he was given to help him deal with a rare chromosome anomaly which causes him physical and communication difficulties.
Along with his mum, Ashley, he set up the Sebbie Hall Kindness Foundation - which focusses on helping vulnerable youngsters - and has donated tens of thousands of pounds to individuals and projects in Staffordshire.
The statue has been created from recycled materials and was produced using 3D scanning technology.
