Three people have died following a car crash and fire in East Yorkshire.
The collision happened on the A63 near Melton at about 22:00 GMT on Monday when a white BMW collided with a grey Peugeot before setting alight.
A woman and two men were pronounced dead at the scene, while a third man was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries, police said.
One of the victims was named as 43-year-old mother-of-one Ali Clark by her husband in a Facebook tribute.
Rob Clark described her as "a beautiful soul".
"As well as being my guiding star, love and best friend, she was a wonderful mum," he said.
Mr Clark said his wife was well-known locally and worked for a number of community groups in the Elloughton area of East Yorkshire.
"She helped countless people individually," he added. 
"I'm going to miss her. That's a massive understatement, but words are not enough. It does not feel real."  
Anyone who saw what happened has been asked to contact Humberside Police.
The force said it had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) due to an active police operation in the area before the collision.
A police spokesperson said it was "standard procedure for us to engage with the IOPC after an incident of this nature".
The A63 was closed for several hours in both directions while investigations were carried out.
Both carriageways have now reopened.
