A man has died following a "medical incident" on a fishing vessel off the coast of Plymouth, HM Coastguard said. 
The man in his 20s, from Belgium, was airlifted to hospital after operators were alerted to the incident before 16:00 GMT on Tuesday.
There were reports of five people on board - one man, also in his 20s from Belgium, sustained serious injuries and is receiving hospital treatment.
The police said they were called to the scene shortly after 19:35 GMT.
Salcombe and Plymouth lifeboats, police and Newquay's Coastguard helicopter all attended.
The coastguard said the casualty was airlifted to hospital "while the vessel was escorted into Plymouth".
Belgian authorities are working alongside the force and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch to locate and inform the man's next of kin.
The death is not being treated as suspicious, and a file is being completed on behalf of the coroner.
