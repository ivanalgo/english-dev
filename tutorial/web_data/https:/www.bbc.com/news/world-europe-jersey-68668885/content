Passengers are being urged to leave plenty of time if they are using Jersey Airport between Wednesday and Easter Monday.
More than 30,000 people are expected to travel in and out of the airport, with a large number of flights scheduled.
The airport has asked passengers to plan ahead and follow staff advice.
The weekend coincides with the launch of the recent implementation of new security screening equipment.
Head of security Maria Le Tiec said: "We are proud to be one of the first airports in the British Isles to have installed the new security screening equipment which allows liquids and electronic devices to remain in hand baggage.
"Passengers should check what they can take through security at every airport they are travelling through. They may still need to transport liquid in 100ml containers in clear plastic bags at some airports."
