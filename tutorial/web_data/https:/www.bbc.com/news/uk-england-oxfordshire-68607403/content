A tour operator has launched eight new all-electric buses.
City Sightseeing Oxford is adding the vehicles to its fleet of open-top buses which currently has three that were previously retro-fitted.
They form part of Oxford Bus Company's Â£82.5m scheme to bring 159 new battery buses to the city.
Managing director Luke Marion called it a "landmark moment" and a "significant investment" in Oxford's visitor economy.
The new buses include glazed staircases and roof lights to improve views of the city, and safety features such as digital camera mirror systems.
Mr Marion said the buses were powered by "100% renewable electricity and will help improve air quality and make Oxford an even more attractive place to visit".
City Sightseeing Oxford runs open-top bus tours of the city, taking in sights such as Oxford Castle, Christ Church College, Magdalen Bridge, Sheldonian Theatre and the Ashmolean Museum.
Hayley Beer-Gamage, CEO of tour guides Experience Oxfordshire, said: "The new fleet is a fantastic example of the confidence and commitment Oxfordshire operators have in the future of our sector and it is great to see City Sightseeing Oxford leading the way on sustainable transport initiatives."
