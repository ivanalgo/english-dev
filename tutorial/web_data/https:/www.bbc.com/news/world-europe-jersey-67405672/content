There are concerns graves in Jersey have been damaged by trees that were blown over in a recent storm.
Two large cedar trees at St Mary's Parish Church were uprooted during Storm Ciar√°n on 2 November. 
Relatives of people buried in the church yard have contacted the rector, concerned the graves of loved ones could have been affected.   
Reverend Kirsty Allen said work to remove the trees would be stopped if any human remains were uncovered.
She said: "Anyone doing the work here needs to be sensitive to the fact that this is a sacred place and special to lots of people for lots of reasons.
"People assumed that this might be ancient church yard but actually there are more recent burials on the top of some of these plots and those are the family members who have contacted me.
"It's happened to me before in a church yard. A big sink hole appeared and there were exposed bones. 
"I have just been trying to reassure people that we're dealing with it and that there is a process and that we will be very respectful." 
She said relatives of the graves affected and the Viscount would also be informed. 
Ms Allen also wants wood from the uprooted trees to be used to benefit the church and the parish with plans to create a bench and space for a forest church. 
Regarding the trees she said: "The grandfather of one of the members of the congregation planted them so there is a history and people are sad they have come down."
