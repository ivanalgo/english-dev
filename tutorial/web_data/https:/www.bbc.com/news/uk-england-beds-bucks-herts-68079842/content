A councillor has apologised for a "lack of details" in its communication before more than 1,100 trees were felled.
Residents in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, have complained that Central Bedfordshire Council contractors felled trees that screened them from an industrial estate.
The council said the removed trees had been causing drainage problems.
Simon Ford, the council's executive member for highways, said he understood "the frustration felt by residents".
Stephen Addy, an Ampthill town councillor and member of Ampthill Heights Residents' Association, said the removal of the trees along the A507 was "brutal".
He said: "[It] has changed the vista for many residents from an established mature tree-lined road to one of destruction and desolation.
"Why was there no consultation over removing the trees?"
Mr Ford, an independent councillor for Sandy, told the council's Sustainable Communities Overview and Scrutiny Committee that the felling works were required for "safety reasons".
He said: "All these works are in compliance with the relevant legislation afforded the council as highways authority.
"We have seen with the recent flooding how important the drainage work is and it will allow us to better maintain the road surface. There has been a programme of planting in the area to maximise tree numbers locally, during the last few years."
"I apologise to residents and councillors about the lack of details in our early communications, and that is something I have discussed with officers moving forward."
He added that the council was "considering what mitigation measures might be possible to offset the visual impact of removing the trees".
