A motorist was rescued after becoming trapped in rising tidal waters on the only road on to an island.
Essex Fire & Rescue Service was called to The Strood, at Mersea Island near Colchester, at about 13:25 BST.
A total of four vehicles were abandoned and were awaiting recovery, the fire service said.
Watch manager Gary Clarke said: "If you can't see any signs about how deep the water is, don't risk driving through it."
Motorists travelling to West Mersea along The Strood - which has since reopened - are advised to check tide times at BBC Weather.
