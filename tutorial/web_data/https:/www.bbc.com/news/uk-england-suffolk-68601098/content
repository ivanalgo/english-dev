Two pubs nestled on the east Suffolk coastline have closed their doors for the final time, their managers have announced.
Landlords Julian and Kayleigh Wallis said The Eel's Foot Inn, Eastbridge, and The Bell Inn, Middleton, called last orders on Sunday.
In a statement on Facebook, they said it had not been the "easiest decision".
The brewery Adnams, which owns both venues, said it wanted to reopen them "as soon as possible".
"Both are greatly valued pubs at the heart of the community," the spokesperson said.
Mr and Mrs Wallis cited increasing bills and health concerns as reasons for their decision to step aside from running both pub businesses
They thanked their "hardworking" staff and added: "Thank you to all our amazing customers, loyal and new, throughout the years."
The Eel's Foot, which overlooks RSPB Minsmere, and The Bell, have been a favourite for nature-lovers trekking the east Suffolk coastline.
One customer wrote on Facebook: "How sad that you're leaving - you always have a happy cheery face brightening up the day."
