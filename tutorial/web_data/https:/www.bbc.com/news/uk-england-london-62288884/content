Two men have died in separate shootings in London within the space of 24 hours, police have confirmed.
A 22-year-old man was shot on High Road, Wood Green, at about 21:30 BST on Sunday and died at the scene. He has not yet been named. 
The death follows another shooting just over four miles away in Waltham Forest.
Sam Brown, 28, took himself to hospital after being shot at a gathering in Cheney Row Park. He later died and a murder investigation has been launched.
Police said one man had been arrested in connection with the Waltham Forest shooting.
No arrests have been made over the Wood Green shooting, but detectives said the victim's next of kin had been informed.
Elsewhere in London, a man in his 40s remains in a life-threatening condition after being stabbed in Playford Road, Seven Sisters.
He was found injured 06:15 BST on Sunday, the Met said. 
The two fatal shootings follow another killing in the early hours of 19 July, when a 26-year-old man was shot in Bruckner Street, Queen's Park, west London. Seven people were arrested over the death and later released under investigation.
Up until then, there had been no firearms killings in London since 31 October last year.
In 2021, there were 12 fatal shootings among a total of 134 homicides recorded by the Met Police.
Earlier this year, in April, the force said it had seen a reduction in gun crime, with the number of all shootings, including fatal and non-fatal, down from from 283 in 2019/20 to 196 in 2021/22.
