A bus company has offered free travel for veterans and UK Armed Forces personnel during Remembrance weekend.
Passengers on First Bus services in the West of England can claim free tickets by showing their service ID card or by wearing their military uniform.
It is valid on all services apart from the Airport Flyer.
First Bus said they wanted to make it easier for passengers to travel to and from Remembrance services and events.
Rob Pymm, commercial director for First West of England and Cymru, said: "Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday are important and solemn reminders of the sacrifices made by so many in our armed forces, and we want to do something to mark these occasions.
"Across First Bus, a number of our colleagues are veterans, and we're very proud of their efforts and sacrifice. 
"This is our way of saying thank you to them, as well as honouring the men and women who choose to serve and protect the freedoms we now enjoy.
"I am pleased that our business can play our part in supporting and remembering those in military service past and present."
