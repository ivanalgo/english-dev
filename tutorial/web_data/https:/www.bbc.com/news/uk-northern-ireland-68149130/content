Details of an investment zone for Northern Ireland will be published later alongside the deal to restore Stormont.
The zone was promised as part of a wider £3.3bn financial package.
Investment zones are a levelling up policy which provide grants and tax breaks to a region.
It is understood the zone will cover all of Northern Ireland though the tax breaks will be more narrowly focused.
It will be worth up to £150m in cash and tax incentives and it is likely the zone will align with one of Stormont's economic development priorities, such as green industries.
A prospectus could be jointly published by the Stormont and Westminster governments within weeks.
As in Scotland and Wales, the UK government will commit to a joint role in the design, decision making and oversight of the zone.
It is understood there is also an intention to look at how the investment zone benefits could be extended to the Stranraer/Cairnryan area of Scotland, which is the main point of entry for Northern Ireland goods going to Great Britain.
