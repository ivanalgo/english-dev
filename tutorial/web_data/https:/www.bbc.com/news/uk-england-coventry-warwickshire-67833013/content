A West Midlands MP has announced the birth of her first child, a "beautiful baby girl".
Taiwo Owatemi, the MP for Coventry North West, revealed on social media on Wednesday that she had been born on 22 December. 
The Labour MP said both her and her daughter were doing well and they were cherishing their time together as a family at home.
Ms Owatemi said she would now take some time off for maternity leave.
The Coventry MP has been on medical leave since the beginning of November.
She said: "In light of this joyful occasion, I will be taking some time off for maternity leave to spend with my family.
"While I am on maternity leave, my dedicated team will be able to assist with any and all enquiries you may have.
"They are committed to ensuring that you continue to receive any support you need while I am away.
"Your understanding during this time means a lot to me and I look forward to returning to work after this special time with my family."
Ms Owatemi was elected in December 2019, before which she had worked in the NHS as a senior cancer pharmacist.
Since being elected, she has volunteered in the same role at University Hospital Coventry.
