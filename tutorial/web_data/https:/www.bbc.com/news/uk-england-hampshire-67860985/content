Rail passengers travelling between Southampton and Bournemouth face a day of disruption due to urgent track repairs following a trackside fire.
Network Rail said "substantial rail damage" had been caused affecting the line in both directions at Hinton Admiral.
It said specialist teams were replacing 6m (20ft) of damaged conductor rail.
The lines have since reopened, but CrossCountry and South Western Railway (SWR) services remain disrupted.
SWR said services may be cancelled, delayed or revised for the rest of the day.
Replacement buses are running between Bournemouth and Southampton on an ad hoc basis.
