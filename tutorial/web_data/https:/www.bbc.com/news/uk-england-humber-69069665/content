The daughter of a couple whose East Yorkshire home was badly damaged by fire after a lightning strike has told of their "heartbreak".
A fire broke out at the house in Holme-on-Spalding-Moor after the lightning strike at about 17:00 BST on Sunday.
Caroline Moore said her mother and stepfather, who had lived in the house for 30 years, had lost "everything they owned".
"The house is ruined from top to bottom," she said.
Talking about the impact, Ms Moore added: "My mum and stepdad are both 80 this year - you just get to that time in your life and you don't really need all this.
"It's just so difficult - so much to sort out."
She said that as well as the damage to the property, the couple had lost treasured personal possessions, including jewellery made from her grandma's ashes.
"My mum was really upset," she said.
However, she thanked the community in the village near Market Weighton for rallying round to help.
A neighbour has set up a fundraising page to help the couple buy essential items until their insurance settlement is sorted out.
In a post on the fundraising page, Becky Belcher wrote: "I can't even begin to imagine what they are going through, but wanted to do something to help."
By Tuesday evening, the effort had raised more than £5,000 towards its £6,500 target.
