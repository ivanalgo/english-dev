Plaid Cymru took control in Carmarthenshire council, despite its leader losing his seat, as Labour lost Neath Port Talbot. 
Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats made gains in Pembrokeshire, where Plaid lost seats. 
Labour held Swansea but lost Neath Port Talbot to no overall control. 
Plaid Cymru's Carmarthenshire council leader Emlyn Dole said losing his seat was "tough" but there was a big contest to "take the leader out".
Where no party wins more than half the seats - known as "no overall control" - there may be talks lasting several weeks to decide who runs the authority.
