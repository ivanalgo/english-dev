A photographer injured in a fall was rapidly supported due to a rescue team undergoing training nearby.
The Edale Mountain Rescue Team had just started an assessment day near Ladybower Reservoir, Derbyshire, on Saturday when the alarm was raised.
The person had fallen on rocks while taking pictures next to the river, near Yorkshire Bridge.
The casualty suffered an injury to their leg and was treated at the scene before being taken to an ambulance.
A spokesperson for the team said they received the call at 09:40 BST.
"As the team was already out working through the first simulated scenarios of the day, the first vehicles were on scene rapidly," they said.
"A photographer had been taking pictures next to the river and slipped on some rocks causing a potentially serious and painful upper leg injury.
"The casualty was secured from the threat of falling further into the water before being given strong analgesia and evacuated back up to the bank to the waiting ambulance."
