Rail services between Reading and Paddington face further delays or cancellations due to a broken rail crossing.
Network Rail said they apologise for the disruption caused to passengers.
The line has had many infrastructure failures in recent months.
Elizabeth Line and Great Western Railway passengers are being warned to expect disruption until Tuesday morning.
A Network Rail spokesperson said: "We're sorry for disruption to services between Reading and London Paddington this morning owing to a cracked rail crossing which was identified by our engineers during an overnight inspection of the lines.
"Normal services started to be reintroduced from 10am but passengers are advised to check with train operators before travelling as journeys may be revised as services recover."
On Sunday, passengers were delayed due to damaged overhead electric cables on the route.
Thousands of passengers were stranded on trains for several hours on 7 December because of a problem with overhead wires.
Four damaged rails were discovered within eight days in November.
An investigation into the performance of the route was launched by the Office of Rail and Road in the same month.
