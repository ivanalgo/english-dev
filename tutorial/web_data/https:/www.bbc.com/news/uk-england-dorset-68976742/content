A theatre company has announced the closure of its performance venue and cafe.
The Black Cherry in Boscombe, Dorset, opened in 2021 and hosts comedy, theatre and music shows.
The company said it would continue to put on events elsewhere but the venue in the town's pedestrian precinct would close at the end of June.
All planned shows will go ahead and the cafe will remain open until the venue's closure.
A statement on the group's Facebook page said: "With heavy hearts, but also an immense sense of pride in our achievements, we're announcing the closure of the Black Cherry as a fixed venue at the end of June.
"Since opening our doors... we've had the joy of hosting more than 60 stand-up comedy nights, showcasing the talents of hundreds of incredible comedians, not to mention many improv, theatre, cabaret and private events. 
"We've supported our community via classes, working alongside local artists, theatre groups, academic institutions and more. We are so proud of all we've achieved with such a small multi-tasking team."
The company said it would continue to host events, including a comedy weekend in Southbourne in June and the Boscombe Carnival takeover in August.
