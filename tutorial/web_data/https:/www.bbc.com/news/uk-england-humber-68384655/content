A man who killed an "amazing" grandad in a crash has been sentenced to four years and eight months in prison.
Stephen Clark, 28, of Howsham, Market Rasen, pleaded guilty to causing the death of 64-year-old David Sixsmith by dangerous driving.
He was attempting to overtake in thick fog on the B1249 between Driffield and Langtoft on 14 November 2022 when he crashed into Mr Sixsmith's motorbike.
Mr Sixsmith died in hospital due to severe injuries to his leg and arm.
Clark was driving his black VW Passat at 60mph at 17:30 GMT when he met Mr Sixsmith's Honda XL Varadero motorbike in the opposing lane.
He pleaded guilty at Hull Crown Court.
David's family said he enjoyed "nothing more" in life than spending time with family and friends.
They said: "Day-to-day tasks are a struggle as we continue to try and forge a path through life without him here. 
"Not a day goes by that we don't miss hearing his voice or wish he could be here to watch his grandchildren grow up."
They added: "David was taken from us because of an act of dangerous driving without a second thought as to the potential devastating consequences and ripple effect that a single decision can have on a family.
"Every road user is part of someone's family, and every driver should treat them as if they were a member of their own."
Sgt Rob Mazingham, from the Serious Collisions Unit of Lincolnshire Police, said: "The split-second decision of Clark that night caused David's family a lifetime of heartache.
"I'm pleased that Clark took responsibility for his reckless driving, sparing David's family the further heartache of a trial. 
"I hope he takes the time behind bars to reflect on his careless action and the impact that it has had."
