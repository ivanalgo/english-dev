The A14 Orwell Bridge is planned to close for 24 hours on Sunday due to expected high winds from Storm Isha. 
The Met Office issued a Yellow warning for Suffolk and forecasted wind gusts of 55mph (88km/h). 
National Highways said "safety preparations" had begun and advised drivers to plan alternative routes.
The bridge is expected to close at midday on Sunday to allow National Highways to "safely install the closure and diversions". 
During the closure, the A14 will be shut between junction 55 at Copdock Mill and junction 58 at Levington, with diversions taking motorists along the A1214, A1189 and A1156 through Ipswich town centre.
"National Highways will constantly monitor wind speeds throughout this period and the bridge could be reopened sooner if it is safe to do so," National Highways said.
Martin Fellows, National Highways regional director for the East of England, added: "We understand the inconvenience the closure of Orwell Bridge causes across the region, but our priority will always be public safety.
"The high winds we are expecting mean it would be unsafe to try and operate the bridge under those conditions."
