A seaside resort in Yorkshire wants its own version of the London Eye.
Scarborough Borough Council has issued a tender document to try and attract a temporary observation wheel.
The authority said it would be located on the site of the former Futurist Theatre.
The council stated any observation wheel would not be a "fairground attraction" and would be in place for 28 days at first, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Any extension to that time period would require planning permission, it said.
Steve Siddons, Labour leader of Scarborough Borough Council, said: "I promised that we would look for a high-quality use for the site when I was elected and this proposal will fit the bill.
"Having an additional high-quality attraction on Scarborough seafront will benefit the South Bay and make use of the site until plans for a permanent solution are finalised."
Bids to operate the observation wheel must be lodged with the authority by 24 June.
