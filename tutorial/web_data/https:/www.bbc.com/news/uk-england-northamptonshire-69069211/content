A young musician from Northamptonshire who is set to support Take That on their European tour said he "can't believe it's actually going to happen".
Alfie Castley, from Mawsley, near Kettering, will open for the pop superstars at shows in Germany, Denmark and Hungary in June and July.
The 20-year-old said it had been "the craziest two months" keeping the news a secret before it was officially announced earlier this month.
"I'm so lucky," he said.
Mr Castley was signed to Relentless Records three years ago after his track Teenage Mona Lisa became popular on social media platform TikTok.
He has just finished studying for a music degree in London and said the opportunity to support Take That had come about through his management team's connections and being "in the right place at the right time".
The singer's stint supporting the band, consisting of Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen, will begin in Hannover on 25 June.
He said the biggest live crowd he had previously played in front of was about 250 people, but up to 16,000 will attend the Take That arena shows.
Mr Castley, who studied at Latimer Arts College, said being a musician had been his dream "since I can remember" and named Fleetwood Mac, Panic! at the Disco, Ed Sheeran and Take That among his musical heroes.
