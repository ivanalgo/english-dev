A village is mourning three men who died after a 4x4 was swept away trying to cross a river, says its vicar.
Floral tributes have been laid near the River Esk in Glaisdale, North Yorkshire, where the victims died on Thursday.
The victims were named as Scott Thomas Daddy, 28, from Hull, Leslie Forbes, 70, from East Yorkshire, and Kenneth 'Patrick' Hibbins, 59, from York.
The Reverend Anthony Bennett said: "It's such a tragic time for us."
A book of condolence was also opened at St Thomas' Church.
Described by Rev Bennett as "close-knit", Glaisdale, with a population of just over 1,000, sits within the North Yorks Moors National Park. 
Rev Bennett added: "It's such a sad time, such a tragic time to have three people die in the river not far from this church. The community here is very close-knit."
He said farmers involved in the recovery operation had attended the church in search of comfort. 
Earlier, friends and family paid tribute to the men via North Yorkshire Police.
Chris Ford, who lives nearby, said the men were participating in an off-roading group when they tried to ford the river at Rake Lane.
The river, swollen by heavy rain, swept them away, carrying them about 400 yards (366m) downstream, where Mr Ford later found the car fully submerged in water, he said.
Police said another man, who tried to help the trapped men, was pulled from the river and needed medical treatment.
The incident took place while Storm Gerrit caused flooding and travel disruption across the country over Wednesday and Thursday.
