A confectionery factory that is due to close in a matter of weeks has been bought, raising fresh hopes of new jobs at the site, the BBC has learned.
The Nestle plant at Fawdon, Newcastle, will shut at the end of December with the loss of more than 400 workers.
It has emerged that Country Style Foods, which makes bread, cakes and baked goods, has bought the factory.
"The sale relates to the premises only and the business has not been transferred," Nestle said.
Country Style Foods, which also has sites in Benton, Stockton and Berwick, has been approached for a comment.
Newcastle Labour councillor Alex Hay, who was part of a local taskforce set up after the factory closure was announced, welcomed the news.
"Country Style Foods are a fantastic company who will bring employment opportunities to the Fawdon site, which is something we wanted as it's a key employment site in the city," he said.
"I hope they will carefully consider the skills of the Nestle workforce and absorb as many as possible into their new operation at Fawdon."
The former Rowntree plant has been operating since 1958, producing brands including Fruit Pastilles, Rolo, Toffee Crisp and Munchies.
In 2022 Nestle confirmed the factory would close, with the loss of almost 500 jobs.
It had said the majority of production would move to Halifax, in West Yorkshire, although some would also move to factories in the Czech Republic, Poland and Bulgaria.
A spokesperson said it had been "carefully exploring options" for the future of the site.
"We are pleased to have exchanged contracts with an established local business to purchase the factory," they said.
"The sale relates to the premises only and the business has not been transferred."
