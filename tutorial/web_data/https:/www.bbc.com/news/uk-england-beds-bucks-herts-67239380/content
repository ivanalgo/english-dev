An art auction featuring contributions from celebrities has raised £37,500 for charity.
Jodie Whittaker, Leigh Francis and about 180 artists made pictures of campervans in aid of Samaritans of North Herts and Stevenage.
The "Samarivans" idea was the work of Hitchin artist Sarah Graham, who was inspired by a similar celebrity art project by Background Bob.
She said: "It has been an incredible and very emotional project."
The artist said she was overwhelmed by support and "it means so much that I've been able to give back to the charity that has saved my life in the past".
On Friday it was revealed Whittaker's Doctor Who-inspired art was the last piece to sell, making £1,200 after a previous bid fell through.
In a message to Ms Graham, the former Time Lord said: "Congratulations - what a huge achievement, you must feel so proud, what a thing to have organised."
The actor will sign 50 limited prints of her art which will be sold to raise more money for the charity. 
The highest selling van, by artist Richard Rowan, sold for £3,400.
Lisa Hawtin from the Samaritans said fundraising allowed them to remain open.She said they were staggered by the fundraiser, adding: "Samarivans has created a real buzz in and around Hitchin - and across the country - which helps people recognise that they can call us whenever they need to. 
"All of the 100-plus volunteers at North Herts and Stevenage Samaritans are incredibly grateful for the massive amount of creativity and hard work Sarah and her team have thrown into all the Samarivans projects."
All the art created for the project will be published in a book next year with all profits going to the Samaritans.
