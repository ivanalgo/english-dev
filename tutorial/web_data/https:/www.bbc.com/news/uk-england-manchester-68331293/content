A show in memory of Brianna Ghey is due to take place in Manchester's Gay Village.
The 16-year-old, who was transgender, was stabbed 28 times by two teenagers in a Cheshire park in February 2023.
Transgender activist Jaxon Feeley said: "Her family have suffered so much, and I wanted to do something as a show of love and solidarity.
"Although being trans wasn't the reason behind Brianna's death, it was a part of her experience."
Brianna's mother Esther Ghey said she was "over the moon to be part of this event".
An array of performers have volunteered to take part in the show to raise funds for Ms Ghey's organisation Peace & Mind UK.
She set it up after Brianna's death to promote the teaching of mindfulness.
Ms Ghey said: "After reaching our target to provide every school within the Warrington area with a mindfulness teacher, my aim now is to raise enough funds to roll this out across the country and provide every child with the resources and opportunity to learn about and take care of their mental health."
Last week in Parliament, Ms Ghey backed calls to put mindfulness on the national curriculum and has urged for better online safety, after the trial revealed Brianna's killer Scarlett Jenkinson had watched videos of violence on the dark web before the murder.
Brianna was attacked by Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both then aged 15, in Culcheth on 11 February 2023. 
During the sentencing on 2 February, the judge said Jenkinson was motivated by a "deep desire to kill", while Ratcliffe's motivation was partly due to his hostility to Brianna's transgender identity.
