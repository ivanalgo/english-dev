The landlord of a well-known pub in Suffolk said he has been forced to close due to rising costs and the "eye-watering loss of trade" during the Covid lockdowns.
Black Tiles in Martlesham announced its closure via a Facebook post on Tuesday. 
Messages have poured with the local community sharing their condolences and good wishes for the staff. 
Landlord Adrian Carr, who has been associated with the pub for 25 years, said: "This hurts me to the core."
"Black Tiles never recovered from the eye-watering loss of trade during the Covid pandemic lockdowns," he added.
"The price rises of raw products and tripling energy costs, compounded by the increased cost of living, eventually made it an impossible feat to make ends meet." 
He thanked customers, stating he had been "blessed" by their kindness and friendship. 
One patron wrote: "We loved our favourite place... we've made some of our most happy memories over the years at the Black Tiles."
Another commented: "This is so sad and frustrating that so many establishments are having to close because of after effects of Covid and the ever rising energy/food bills."
Ryan Miller, general manager of nearby Red Lion, posted on social media to say he may be able to offer staff alternative employment at his pub.
"I may be able to provide some roles for [the] team so finances don't become a worry for them," he said.
