Gas supply charges in Jersey and Guernsey are soon to increase for residential and business customers amid "inflationary pressures", an energy boss has said. 
Jo Cox, CEO of Islands Energy Group (IEG) said tariffs would rise from 14 May 2024.
Customers of Guernsey Energy and Island Energy pay a fixed daily standing charge.
This network charge, which is surplus to the unit rate, will rise by 10%. 
For the average household this equates to around four pence per day, £1.16p a month, or about £13.90 a year, the firm said. 
It is the second price increase for IEG customers in 2024, following a rise in gas unit rates in January.
Jo Cox, CEO at Islands Energy Group, said: "The standing charge increase reflects inflationary pressures which have seen our costs rise in supplying gas to homes and businesses. 
"We continue to invest in our network, infrastructure, and research into renewable and low carbon gas to deliver our net zero targets.
 "We last reviewed our standing charges in 2020 as we try to keep our customers' tariffs and costs as low as we can for as long as we can. 
"However, we do need to review our charges and costs on a regular basis." 
 She said anyone struggling to pay bills should contact the customer service team. 
"We take our duty of care to customers very seriously and make extra provisions for those who require extra support," she added. 
 Prices were due to be published on Islands Energy Group's website on 14 May.
