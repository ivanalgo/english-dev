Transport for London (TfL) is exploring new ways of dealing with "ghost marks" on the walls of Elizabeth line's platforms.
The marks behind platform benches are caused by people leaning against the walls.
TfL is trying out solutions to the problem, including putting vinyl coverings behind the seats.
The line spans 73 miles from Reading and Heathrow Airport in the west to Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east.
The issue was raised in a recent written question to Mayor Sadiq Khan by Caroline Pidgeon, a Liberal Democrat on the London Assembly.
She asked how TfL is ensuring the walls are regularly cleaned so that "the stations remain fresh for decades to come".
The mayor's office responded: "A rigorous cleaning programme is maintained at all of TfL's stations to ensure a clean and safe environment for customers.
"However, TfL is exploring new ways to clean the walls behind seating at some of its Elizabeth line stations to try to remove any marks and protect the walls in future.
"TfL is also trialling the installation of vinyl coverings behind the seating area and is in the process of evaluating the results."
Images of the vinyl coverings reveal a range of tested designs, including different coloured "pawn" shapes and a block design which uses the Elizabeth line's fabric pattern.
