An otter has been rescued after becoming trapped in a connecting pipe between two overflow pools at a sewage treatment works. 
Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service worked with agencies, including the RSPCA and the Environment Agency, to release the animal on Tuesday.
They said a long stick and "a bit of persuasion" were used to lure it into a cat carrier at Milford, Derbyshire.
It was then safely returned to the River Derwent.
