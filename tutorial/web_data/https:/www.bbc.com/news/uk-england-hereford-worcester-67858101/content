Heavy rain falling on saturated ground and swollen rivers is expected to cause travel disruption and flooding across parts of the West Midlands. 
A yellow weather warning for rain has been issued across the region from 17:00 BST on Monday until 21:00 on Tuesday. 
Flood warnings are in place along the length of the River Severn from Shrewsbury in Shropshire down to Upton-upon-Severn in Worcestershire.
High winds are also expected.
This yellow warning for wind also affects the whole of the region from 08:00 until 21:00 on Tuesday. 
The Met Office said 15 to 30mm (0.5 to 1in) of rain was expected to fall.
Some parts of the region may see as much as 35 to 50 mm (1.3 to 2in) of rain, and flooding of homes and businesses is possible.
Properties in Worcester were already affected by flood water, with the river levels peaking earlier on Monday. 
With the further rainfall forecast water levels were expected to remain high, the Environment Agency said. 
Emergency services were called to rescue a woman from the River Severn near Sabrina Bridge in the city on Monday morning, but she had already been pulled to safety by members of the public, said the fire service. 
A flood warning is also in place for the River Leam at Eathorpe, Huningham and Offchurch in Warwickshire. 
A temporary pump has been installed in Long Itchington to help minimise flooding in the area.
