Primark has announced it will open a new store formerly occupied by Debenhams next month.
The clothing store will be at the Arc shopping centre in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk and will be open to customers on 6 March. 
It will be the global retailer's 193rd store in the UK and will employ 100 staff. 
Philippa Nibbs, Primark's UK director of sales, said: "We're looking forward to becoming a part of the community."
The 33,300 sq ft (3094m²) store will offer customers the option to self-checkout as part of an ongoing trial. 
"Since we first announced plans to open the store, it's been great to see such a positive reaction from the local community," added Ms Nibbs. 
The shop will form part of a £100m investment from Primark into its UK portfolio this year, which aims to reach 195 stores and add up to 700 new staff members.
