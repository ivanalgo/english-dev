A novice jockey is taking part in England's oldest horse race to raise money and awareness of breast cancer.
The Kiplingcotes Derby, near Market Weighton in East Yorkshire, has been held since 1519 and traditionally takes place on the third Thursday of March.
The cross country course includes farm lanes, tracks and public roads in the Yorkshire Wolds.
Carole Johnston is taking on the challenge in memory of her friend Kate Jeffery, who died last year.
Ms Johnston said: "Kate loved horses, like me, from being a child, but I have only ridden at home. 
"This is a big ask for me to do a race and it will be quite scary - there will be people there who are jockeys."
Ms Johnston will be riding her friend's horse Lorna.
She said: "I'm very protective of Lorna. It's all about getting Lorna safely there because there's big ruts in some of the course and it's very wet. 
"We will be going with speed but we will be going very carefully."
Ms Jeffery's husband Chris said: "To compete in [the race] is quite an amazing thing, and I'm so proud of Carol to even attempt it. 
"She's not probably as strong a horse rider maybe as Kate used to be, but she's got the heart of a lion.
"She's so passionate about helping raise money and raise awareness of breast cancer and riding Lorna in this race is just truly amazing."
Mr Jeffery said his wife "loved everything about horses" and was "a wonderful horsewoman".
"Kate will be up there looking down on us, I know she will, and it's her legacy. Lorna is her legacy and along with Carol, it gives us a wonderful opportunity."
As well as raising awareness, Ms Johnston is raising money for St Leonard's Hospice in York.
Mr Jeffery added: "Towards the end of Kate's life, I really don't know how I would have coped without them. They were just amazing."
