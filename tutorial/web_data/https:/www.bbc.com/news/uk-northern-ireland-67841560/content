Two people have died following separate collisions on roads in Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours.
A 21-year-old woman died after a single-vehicle crash in Aghadowey, County Londonderry, on Thursday night. 
Lydia Ross, who was from the Ballymoney area, sustained serious injuries in the crash in the Curragh Road area.
In Mayobridge, County Down, a pedestrian in his 40s died at the scene of a collision on Hilltown Road shortly after 06:00 GMT on Friday.
Police said a grey Audi A4 was involved in the Mayobridge incident.
The Aghadowey crash happened at about 22:15 GMT on Thursday and involved a blue Peugeot 207.
Ms Ross was taken to hospital for treatment but later died from her injuries. 
Writing on social media, her father Paul Ross paid tribute to his "beautiful daughter Princess Lydia".
"Words can't describe how we are feeling," the father of three added. 
He said Lydia had accompanied him to Ballymena United football matches "every Saturday" and he shared a photo of himself and his daughter, saying it was "our last selfie on Boxing Day". 
Dunaghy Flute Band posted on Facebook that the local community had been left "numb and in disbelief".
Enquiries are ongoing and police have appealed for anyone with information or dashcam footage to contact them.
