Three parks could be left unlocked overnight to save a council paying a contractor £15,000 a year to lock and reopen them.
The changes could be implemented at Taunton's Vivary Park, Wellington Park and Blenheim Gardens in Minehead. 
They are the only three parks owned and operated by Somerset Council to be locked at night.
The council said no decisions had been made but it was "in an unprecedented position due to rising costs".
Leaving the park gates unlocked is one of a number of money-saving measures being considered by the council to fill a £100m gap in its budget for 2024/5.
People using Vivary Park had mixed thoughts on the possible change.
One cyclist said: "It drives me mad [when they lock the gates] because I cycle home from work every day through the park and I've been locked in more than once.
"I know the council is in huge difficulty and as a cost-saving measure I'd much rather they left the gates open than cut care for older people."
But other residents shared concerns with BBC Radio Somerset about vandalism.
A spokesperson for Somerset Council said: "We understand there will be concerns. 
"To be clear, no decisions have been made and will not be until the budget is set at full council on 20 February. 
"If we cannot set a balanced budget, government commissioners will do it for us, without the local knowledge or concern about the longer term.
"We'll continue to speak to parish, town and city councils and community groups. We hope in many cases if we have to stop our funding others will be able to pick up some of these services."
