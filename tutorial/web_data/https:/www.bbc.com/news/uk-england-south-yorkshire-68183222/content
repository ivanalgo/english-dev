A new footbridge has been installed at Dore & Totley station as part of a multimillion-pound railway upgrade.
The 49ft (15m) long structure will link the existing platform to a second platform, which is currently being restored.
Lifts have also been installed at either end to provide disabled access to and from the new platform.
The work is part of a Â£137m upgrade of the Hope Valley Railway, which runs between Sheffield and Manchester.
A spokesperson for Network Rail said accessibility had been "at the forefront of the work", with contractors meeting with local disability groups during construction.
Graeme Whitehead, senior sponsor for the Hope Valley Railway Upgrade, said: "The completion of these works is a key milestone for the programme, as we edge closer to full completion of the Hope Valley Railway Upgrade.
"Our plans for Dore & Totley Station were centred around accessibility and after careful consultation with a number of groups, the delivery of these upgrades means the area will have a modern station that suits all needs."
Upgrade work at the station, including the installation of new track to allow longer trains with more carriages to stop, is expected to be finished in March.
Other work along the line includes creating a railway loop between Bamford and Hathersage, a new footbridge at Hathersage West and improvements to signalling.
