A police and crime commissioner (PCC) has proposed increasing the policing element of council tax bills.
Darryl Preston has requested a rise of £12.96 per year for households in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.
The proposal is just four pence shy of the maximum £13 rise that is permitted. 
It would mean Band D households would pay £285.48 in the next financial year, up from £272.52. The plans are due to be discussed on Wednesday.
The increase would be about 25p more a week.
Mr Preston said the precept would generate £87.5m, which he claimed was essential for ensuring a balanced budget without needing to cut into the force's cash reserves. 
His budget also lays out almost £4m of savings through 2024-25, with just under £1m coming from the tri-force major crimes unit between Bedfordshire Police, Cambridgeshire Constabulary and Hertfordshire Constabulary.
Police will also try to cultivate a "smaller, better, greener estate", budget documents say, while efficiencies brought about by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) will "ensure optimisation of processes so that resourcing levels can be fully optimised". 
Beyond next year, a "review of the workforce mix" is planned, budgeted to generate a saving of £1.55m in 2025-26 and £600,000 in 2026-27, "due to the need to maintain police officer numbers", the documents said. 
Cambridgeshire's police and crime panel, attended by councillors from across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, will discuss the PCC's budget and precept on Wednesday.
