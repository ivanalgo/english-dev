The newly-elected rector of St Andrews University is facing calls to apologise over an email accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.Stella Maris said Palestinians had suffered "apartheid, siege, illegal occupation and collective punishment" during the Israel-Gaza war.Hundreds of students have demanded that she retract her remarks or resign just a month after taking up the role.St Andrews University said it was "dismayed" by the rector's comments.The row came as hundreds of people attended demonstrations in Scotland on Saturday calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.In Glasgow, people gathered at the Buchanan Street steps on Saturday holding signs and banners which said "ceasefire now".First Minister Humza Yousaf and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar took part in the Scottish Trades Union Congress's (STUC) annual St Andrew's Day protest which saw marchers gather at Glasgow Green. Asked about the St Andrews rector's comments he said: "There are communities - Jewish communities, Muslim communities - who are feeling vulnerable and all of us have a responsibility to make sure we are simmering down any of those tensions as opposed to inflaming them."We can do that while very passionately arguing that what's happening in Gaza is unacceptable."
In a message to students sent on Tuesday, Ms Maris described how a vigil at the university was held earlier this month "following weeks of genocidal attacks by the Israeli government against Gaza".She said: "We must continue to recognize and condemn acts that are internationally regarded as humanitarian and war crimes."It is also crucial to acknowledge and denounce the actions by Hamas that qualify as war crimes, notably the taking of hostages and deliberately targeting civilians, which I have and continue to do."The email also included a link to a website which carried a story headlined: "The evidence Israel killed its own citizens on Oct 7." However, Ms Maris clarified that she sent her email two days before the website had published its article. 
The role of rector, elected by students, is to provide pastoral support and represent the student community at the university's governing body where the rector serves as president. Ms Maris has rejected accusations that the message to students was antisemitic and argued her use of the terms genocide and apartheid were "supported by numerous human rights organizations".She told BBC Scotland News she would not be resigning and insisted she had done the right thing. Ms Maris sad: "I have received a lot of backlash and it's quite disappointing. "I really tried to write a statement that would make everyone happy, but realised I wasn't being true to my beliefs. "I'm glad I did it and it was the right thing to do."The rector added: "I've had racist comments as a result and have been accused of antisemitism, which I reject. "I don't intend on retracting my statement or resigning. "I denounce antisemitism in the strongest form. Reject the weaponising of antisemitism."However, a large group of students at the university, which was founded in 1413 and is one of the oldest in the UK, insisted Ms Maris's comments "will only bring division and hatred".They are now calling for her to apologise or step down.
In a letter to the rector, they say: "We are concerned that your letter does not demonstrate equal care for Palestinian and Israeli lives."What is truly unacceptable is that you do not care to mention, let alone demonstrate regard for, the two St Andrews students who were recently attacked because of their religion."Moreover, your letter does not show any appreciation for how your inflammatory and unfounded accusations of 'genocide,' 'apartheid,' and 'occupation' concerning the Jewish State will further embolden attacks and hatred against the Jewish students whom you were elected to care for."It is unacceptable for the rector to be selective in their responsibility to represent all students."
Ms Maris is a former English and philosophy graduate at the university and has since filled a series of student representation roles.She was elected rector on 10 October.Responding to Ms Maris's remarks, St Andrews University principal and vice-chancellor, Prof Dame Sally Mapstone, said the university was committed to free speech but that there was "no place for antisemitism, Islamophobia, or racism of any kind".She added: "We are utterly dismayed that the rector, on this occasion, put her right to freedom of expression ahead of her duty to represent all students, and to be concerned for their welfare."We know that while some may have welcomed the message, others have been deeply offended and concerned by it."While every one of us shares a desire for peace and an end to hostilities in Israel and Gaza, we regret that her message, the language it used, and some of the sources it cited have caused alarm, division, and harm in our community, and more widely."
The temporary truce is still holding and follows weeks of fighting and Israeli bombardments of Gaza, with the conflict sparked by Hamas's unprecedented cross-border attack in southern Israel that saw 1,200 people killed.Hamas earlier announced a delay in the release of further Israeli hostages, claiming Israel had broken the terms of the truce deal over aid deliveries to northern Gaza. Israel denied this, and the releases were due to resume following mediation. On the first day of the four-day ceasefire on Friday, Hamas released 24 of the about 240 hostages taken during its attack on Israel and Israel freed 39 Palestinians from prison.The Israeli offensive has killed more than 14,500 Palestinians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza government.
