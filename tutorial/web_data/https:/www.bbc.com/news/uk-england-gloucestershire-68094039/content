A hospice has raised more than £68,000 through its Christmas tree recycling scheme.
Longfield Hospice collected nearly 4,000 trees from households across Stroud, Cirencester and Gloucester, in return for a donation.
Louise Cook, head of fundraising, said it was a "wonderful achievement".
Meanwhile in Somerset, about 2,000 Christmas trees have been donated to Noah's Ark Zoo Farm in Wraxall, to be enjoyed by the animals.
A total of 168 volunteers from Minchinhampton-based Longfield Hospice collected Christmas trees from homes across the county earlier in January.
All the money raised will help fund the hospice's work caring for about 2,500 patients with life-limiting conditions across Gloucestershire, and providing support for their families and carers.
"We're absolutely thrilled to have raised such an amazing amount with our Christmas tree recycling scheme," said Ms Cook.
"We simply could not have managed this without the help of our fabulous volunteers and corporate partners, who have donated vehicles, equipment and their time to help their local hospice," she added.
North Somerset Council said its crews had collected 840 tonnes of recycling in the week after Christmas, which is 70% higher than a normal week. 
Christmas tree recycling schemes in the area raised more than £31,000 with St Peter's Hospice and Weston Hospice benefitting.
Noah's Ark Zoo Farm created a forest of Christmas trees in the elephant enclosure which the animals "really enjoyed", the zoo said.
