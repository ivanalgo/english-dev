An agricultural show, called off due to flooding across its showground site following heavy rain, has been rescheduled.
The Gillingham and Shaftesbury Spring Countryside Show in Dorset was due to be held on 20 and 21 April.
Organisers said, with setting up due to start on 8 April, they were forced to postpone when the Turnpike Showground in Motcombe became waterlogged.
The two-day event will now take place on 8 and 9 June.
Show organiser Cat Harris said: "After the necessary postponement due to the unseasonably heavy rainfall, our team has been working tirelessly behind the scenes to find a solution.
"We are overjoyed the show has been reorganised.
"With 11 days to go before springtime ends... the new date and is still officially in spring." 
Ms Harris said the team behind the show had been able to reorganise the event to ensure all the main ring attractions could still attend the new dates.
The show features a stunt clown comedy show, heavy horses, racing pigs and a Grand National with sheep, alongside horticultural and gardening exhibits.
Organisers added traders' and ticket holders' bookings will automatically be transferred to the new dates or a full refund will be given.
