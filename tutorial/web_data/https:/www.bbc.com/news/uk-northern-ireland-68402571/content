The Executive is aiming to have a budget agreed by the end of April, Stormont's finance minister has said.
A budget does not need to be in place by the start of the new financial year as departments can continue spending on the same basis as this year. 
The legal authority for that spending, known as the Vote on Account, was passed by the Assembly last week.
Dr Caoimhe Archibald said it will be a single year budget rather than one covering a number of years.
She is also expected to bring a proposal to the Executive this week on the regional rate.
It is the portion of rates bills set by Stormont. 
Local councils have already set their portion, known as the district rate.
Earlier this month, First Minister Michelle O'Neill ruled out increasing the regional rate by 15% as a means of revenue raising.
Dr Archibald is also due to meet the chief secretary to the Treasury on Wednesday amid continuing tensions between the UK government and the Executive over the terms of a Â£3.3bn financial package for restoring devolution.
