A stalker accessed his victim's Netflix account and changed her password to "I miss you", Nottinghamshire Police has said.
The force said the man also sent unwanted gifts and delivered handwritten letters to his victim after their relationship broke down.
He bombarded her with texts and emails and followed her home, detectives said.
The force has highlighted the case to raise awareness of what it said was an under-reported offence.
Police said it asked magistrates to grant a stalking protection order to protect the victim, who was left "absolutely terrified" by the ordeal.
The order prevented him from contacting the victim and her family, and prohibited him from visiting any place where she was present.
So far this year, the force has sought seven such orders, on top of 69 granted between 2020 and 2023.
It said it had recorded a four-fold increase in the number of stalking charges, which totalled 198 in 2023. 
Det Insp Abi Groucher, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Stalking and harassment are serious crimes which can have a devastating effect on the lives of victims, their friends, and family.
"Stalking goes to the very heart of violence against women and girls, often removing their feeling of safety."
