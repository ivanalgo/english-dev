Flooding is expected in 20 areas of North Yorkshire later, the Environment Agency (EA) has warned.
Areas near the River Ouse were likely to be affected, including riverside properties and St George's Field and Queen's Staith in York, the EA said.
A spokesperson said it was "monitoring rainfall and river levels and checking rivers for blockages". 
North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said it had rescued a family whose car was stuck in floodwater at Naburn Lock.
The occupants of the vehicle were "assisted to dry land" on Monday, it said.
A number of bridges across North Yorkshire remained closed due to flooding, the EA said.
Those included Cattal Bridge, Cawood Bridge, Buttercrambe Bridge and York Bridge in Tollerton.
