Public toilets in towns across Somerset are set to close to help the unitary council save more than £300,000.
All 25 public toilets run by Somerset Council could shut as the local authority deals with a £100m projected overspend.  
Those include the facilities in Yeovil, Wincanton, Wellington and Frome.
The council said it will "explore all alternative options to work with communities" to protect toilets where possible.
It is now asking parish and town councils to consider taking on the running of public loos. 
Odelle Powles uses the toilets in Vivary Park in Taunton to change her son and because of "mum bladder".
"I think it's absolutely disgusting," she said.
"It's a public amenity which should be available for everyone"
Bev Rowell from Bridgwater said it would be "fine" for the toilets to close "as long as all the cafes open up their toilets".
"I do understand they've got to make cuts somewhere but I'm not happy about it," she said.
Toilet blocks at Yeovil bus station and Yeovil Rec, Wincanton Memorial Hall car park, Wellington Park and North Street, Wellington and Frome Market car park are all earmarked for closure.
A final decision will be taken by Somerset Council when it sets its budget on 20 February.
The council said: "In order to protect statutory services, such as social care, we are having to look at finding alternative ways to provide many discretionary services, including public toilets. 
"In Somerset the majority of public toilets are already run by local communities, including town and parish councils. 
"If this proposal is taken forward, then we would explore all alternative options to work with communities to protect facilities wherever possible."
