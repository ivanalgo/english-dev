An overnight promenade parking ban is being introduced after a van hire firm was criticised for leaving dozens of its vehicles on a Wirral waterfront.
West Wallasey Car and Van Hire apologised for parking up to 100 vehicles in New Brighton and Wallasey.
It angered residents who said it had caused a blight on the town and left them struggling to park.
Wirral Council said the ban will come into force next month.
The company apologised for the inconvenience it had caused to anyone visiting New Brighton and Wallasey in an open letter to residents.
The letter said the firm had no room at its depot after a sudden return of vehicles on short term rental to local authorities and businesses.
It has now agreed a lease with the council to use the site of Wallasey's former gas works off Dock Road in Seacombe for two years from the end of the month and not to park its vehicles on the road.
Steve Taylor, from The New Brighteners conservation group, told BBC North West Tonight people were frustrated by the "eyesore" parking. 
He said: "It is just not on. This prom is not here for the sole benefit of West Wallasey Van Hire. 
"It is a very selfish attitude parking the vehicles 50% of the length of the promenade."
