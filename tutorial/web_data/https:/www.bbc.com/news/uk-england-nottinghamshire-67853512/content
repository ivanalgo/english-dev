A 94-year-old woman has been evacuated from her house which is at risk of falling into a river after a flood-damaged wall collapsed. 
The property in Lowdham, near Nottingham, was evacuated on Friday, after the wall fell into Cocker Beck. 
Environment Agency officials said the property was "unsafe" and "in danger" of partially collapsing into the water way. 
The agency is using three pumps to help move water away from the beck. 
The village was previously hit by flooding in October, when 136 homes were evacuated to protect residents. 
Heavy rain has returned to the area and rising water levels caused a wall next to the house to collapse on Friday. 
Peter Cross, of the Lowdham Flood Action Group, said the house itself was in danger if water continued to rise.
"What's happened to the people in the house is sadly a woman and her 94-year-old mother have had to move out for their own safety," he said.
"The wall could potentially cause a blockage of the beck which would cause flooding.
"The beck is very problematic at the moment."
Mr Cross said he was hopeful a flood alleviation scheme, which is being built a mile outside of the village, would solve the flooding problems.
He added the Environment Agency, which moved three water pumps to the area after the collapse - to move a tonne of water a second to stop the river rising any higher - had been "brilliant".
An agency spokesperson said: "We currently have a flood alert in place for the area; this is to raise awareness and to enable the community to take precautionary measures.
"As further rain is forecast we are asking for local residents to remain vigilant.  
"We are also asking them to keep away from the building and to make sure they are signed up for flood warnings and alerts."
