Newsreader Simon McCoy has announced he is leaving the BBC after 17 years, to join the forthcoming GB News operation.
The journalist, whose funny asides in between stories have often gone viral, making him a household name, confirmed the news on Thursday.
Sam Taylor, head of live and breaking for BBC News, said McCoy was "sharp, funny and a great colleague".
GB News described the incoming anchor "one of Britain's best-loved and most charismatic journalists".
"It has been a delight to have Simon at the helm of the BBC News Channel and BBC News at One," Taylor continued.
"We'll miss his one-liners, pregnant pauses and commitment to breaking news in every form, and wish him the very best for the future."
One of McCoy's new GB news bosses, Andrew Neil, tweeted: "Welcome aboard Simon. Great that you are joining."
