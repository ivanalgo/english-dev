A London Overground line is changing its name in the hope of inspiring more women to take up sport.
Transport for London (TFL) announced the stopper service between Euston and Watford will be named the Lioness Line.
TFL said name is to honour the England women's football team's achievements.
 "It's not just winning that matters - it's the Lionesses' determination which encourages our women and girls to take up sport," Hertsmere Borough Council's Harvey Cohen said.
"The Lionesses' success is a reminder that there is a structure and career for women in sport," the Conservative councillor and member champion for football said.
Cohen added that he was exploring options to increase the uptake in female-led sport.
Liberal Democrat councillor Jennifer Pattinson, Watford Borough Council's portfolio holder for well-being, said it was "great to recognise the fabulous contribution of women to sports".
"We want to see a growth of grassroots women's football in our town because it has been a very male-focused sport in the past," she added.
The new names and colours of all six London Overground lines were announced on Thursday.
The Lioness Line, which runs through Wembley, Harrow and Bushey, will feature yellow parallel lines on the map.
England triumphed over Germany in the UEFA Women's Euro 2022 final at Wembley Stadium.
The side was lead to victory by Milton Keynes' Leah Williamson, who was then honoured with a mural in Newport Pagnell..
Elsewhere in Hertfordshire, the route that runs to Cheshunt will become the Weaver line, which TFL said will recognise East London's textile trade. It will be maroon on the map.
Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: "Giving each of the Overground lines distinct colours and identities will make it simpler and easier for passengers to get around".
