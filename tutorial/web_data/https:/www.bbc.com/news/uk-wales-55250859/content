People in Wales have been told to stay at home and not travel over the new year after the country went into national lockdown.
Stay-at-home restrictions come into effect from the Sunday before Christmas.
The new lockdown rules meant the easing of Christmas rules were reduced to just Christmas Day from the previous plans for a five-day bubble.
People are also being told to avoid social contact to help halt soaring Covid rates - and the lockdown will be reviewed every three weeks.
Travel is not permitted in, out or around Wales unless it is essential - except on Christmas Day - so for things like education, childcare, providing care or work when you cannot work from home.
The Welsh Government said: "If you live in Wales, you will be able to travel to meet one other household on Christmas Day anywhere in Wales. 
"You can also leave Wales, subject to the local restrictions in the area you would be travelling to, and the need to be back at home by the end of the day."
But people are not able to enter areas of England under the new tier four restrictions, mainly in London and the south-east, at all - even on Christmas Day.
Sorry, travel is out as the Welsh Government says "going on holiday is not one of the permitted reasons to travel under the regulations at alert level 4, whether that is in Wales, elsewhere in the UK or overseas.
All accommodation businesses are to be closed, except where they provide accommodation for anybody who is living there as their main residence - or is staying there at that time and is unable to return to their main residence. 
The government has told accommodation businesses they should ensure they do not unintentionally make anyone homeless as a result of closure.
