A Surrey girl who died of a brain tumour has inspired her best friend to take part in a trek for charity.
At the age of six, Jasmine Mahoney, from Lower Kingswood, was diagnosed with a diffuse midline glioma in 2006. 
She underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but died in May 2009.
Her best friend Molly Walton is preparing to trek more than six miles (9.6km) through the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia, in memory of her friend. 
The 24-year-old said: "Jasmine was an outgoing and bubbly girl. Our parents met when we were three months old and we did everything together.
"I wasn't told she was ill because we were so young and I never would have guessed how severe her illness was because she was always so happy, right up until the end."
Speaking of her trek, she said: "I'm a little anxious about encountering snakes but my main concern is the Australian heat because we did some treks in Tasmania recently and the high temperatures made them a lot more challenging."
Molly, also from Lower Kingswood, will be joined by her friend Lucy Bartlett, from Reigate.
The pair, who met as pupils at the former Warwick School in Redhill, will be taking on the challenge in aid of the charity Brain Tumour Research on 31 March.
Molly said she and Lucy were keen to raise a minimum Â£2,740, which is enough to sponsor a day of research at any of the four Brain Tumour Research Centres of Excellence.
Charlie Allsebrook, community development manager for Brain Tumour Research, said: "Jasmine's story is a stark reminder of the indiscriminate nature of brain tumours, which can affect anyone at any time.
"We're really grateful to Molly and Lucy for taking on this challenge for us and wish them the best of luck with it. Together we will find a cure."
