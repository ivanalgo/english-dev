Potentially dangerous concrete has been found in three more Surrey schools, it has been confirmed.
Reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) has been found at Kings College Guildford, the Magna Carta School in Egham Hythe, and the Grove Primary Academy, Frimley.
There are now six schools in Surrey with potentially crumbling concrete.
All six schools are still maintaining on-site face-to-face teaching with their pupils.
The problem concrete has also been found in high-profile venues such as the Harlequin Theatre and Cinema in Redhill, Reigate Police Station, and Frimley Park Hospital.
The three new schools in Surrey were named in the Department for Education's (DfE) updated list of affected schools and colleges, published this week. 
According to the government, any school where Raac is found will be provided with "funding for mitigation works" to cover the costs of propping up roofs or temporary accommodation on site.  
Kings College Guildford found Raac within the roofing of its two sports halls which, when surveyed, was found to be safe for use.
The college later decided to stop using the halls prior to a DfE inspection which found issues with the fabric of the building, according to a letter to parents seen by the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
The college wrote: "We have also managed to secure a large number of bookings at Surrey Sports Park to ensure the quality of provision is not impacted.
"Our hope is that we will be able to use our own facilities from Christmas." 
Kings College Guildford, the Magna Carta School and the Grove Primary Academy have all been approached for comment.
Note all settings with confirmed Raac at 16 October 2023 as published on the government website on 19 October.
