A former bank and offices that have been empty for years could be transformed into new apartments.
The plans from Malvern Homes Ltd could see the former Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) building on Lichfield Street, Walsall, converted into 27 new homes.
If approved, an extra floor would be built on top of the existing building alongside landscaping improvements.
Walsall Council is expected to make a decision on the proposals in December.
The building was one of more than 160 RBS branches that closed across the country in 2018.
Planning agent C14 Designs said the proposals would benefit the three-storey building and its surrounding area and would turn "a blight on the street" into a "functional asset" for the town centre.
The changes would help to make the "stark" and "derelict" office building into a more "familiar and lively residential block", it added.
