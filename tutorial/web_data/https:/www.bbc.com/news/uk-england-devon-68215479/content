A new health scheme in Devon is offering free condoms to people under 25 years old following a rise in people being diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STIs). 
In Devon, new infections increased by 40% from 2021 to 2022, and in Torbay by 86% during the same time.
Under 25s can now access free condoms, dams, and lubricant.
Branded 'Doink', Torbay Council said the scheme would "promote condom use and enhance sexual health".
The council said an increase in testing following the pandemic had revealed the rise in STI rates, with a particular increase in chlamydia.
The council said analysis of Office for Health Improvement and Disparities data revealed new infections in Devon climbed from 368 per 100,000 in 2021 to 515 per 100,000 in 2022 - 40% increase. 
In Torbay, new STI infections increased from 359 per 100,000 in 2021 to 668 per 100,000 in 2022 - 86% increase.
In January, local councils said sexual health services in England were at breaking point due to soaring rates of infections.
Dr Vanessa Apea, NHS sexual health consultant, said: "With STIs on the rise, it's so important that you keep yourself and your partner safe if you are sexually active.
"Using condoms and having regular testing are the best way to do this."
She added they hoped the scheme would "normalise condom use" in young people.
'Doink' is run by Preventx, a sexual health testing service, and The Eddystone Trust, a sexual health charity, which offers free HIV testing. 
The service can be accessed on the 'Doink' website or app, Dr Apea added, with contraception either picked up from collection points or posted out.
