Later on Sunday, the couple will visit the Lagos Polo Club, where a charity match will take place to raise funds for Nigeria: Unconquered, which is in charge of organising the country's team for the Invictus Games. The tour of the country has been personal for Meghan. Speaking at an event on women in leadership on Saturday, the duchess said discovering she had Nigerian heritage via a genealogy test had been eye-opening and humbling. "Every single moment that I hear anyone talk about what it means to be a Nigerian woman, it is the most flattering thing to be in that company," she told audience members.
