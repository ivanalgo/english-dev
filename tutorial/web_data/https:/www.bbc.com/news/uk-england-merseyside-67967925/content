A person has been freed from between two containers on a vessel near Liverpool, firefighters have said.
The victim's legs became stuck at Seaforth Container Base about midday, Merseyside Fire and Rescue added. 
The person, who was conscious, was soon rescued and is now receiving treatment in hospital.
A spokeswoman for Peel Ports, which operates the port said "a third-party crew member was injured".
"Our primary concerns are with the injured crew member and their family and an official investigation to identify what happened will ensue in due course," she added.
"Until then it would be wholly inappropriate to speculate."
Airbags and hydraulic equipment were used to release the victim on the vessel, which is berthed at the Port of Liverpool.
