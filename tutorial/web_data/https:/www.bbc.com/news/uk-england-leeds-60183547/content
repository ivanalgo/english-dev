A man has escaped with cuts and bruises from a van crushed by a tree that fell in Storm Malik's strong winds. 
Richard Nutter was getting changed in the back of the vehicle after cycling when the tree came down on top of it in Apperley Bridge, Bradford.
He was initially trapped in the back seat but a friend managed to pull him out.
Shaken by the ordeal, Mr Nutter said he was a "very lucky man" to have escaped.
A nine-year-old boy died in Staffordshire and a 60-year-old woman was killed in Aberdeen after being hit by falling trees amid gusts of up to 85mph.
"I was sat in between the two back seats, just crouching down and it pushed me further down," Mr Nutter said, describing the moment the tree crashed on top of him.
"I lay on the floor and my friend pulled me out the back of the van."
Mr Nutter's friend Lee Warriner told the BBC: "We're both very fortunate."
Strong gusts have caused widespread disruption as Storm Malik sweeps across northern parts of the UK.
The Humber Bridge was partly closed after a lorry was blown on to its side by strong winds.
The bridge, between Hessle and Barton-upon-Humber, was shut by emergency services at about 13:30 GMT. It remains closed to northbound traffic.
High-sided vehicles were not allowed to cross the bridge this morning.
The ambulance service has been contacted for information about the welfare of those in the lorry when it turned over.
