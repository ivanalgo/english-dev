A seven-year-old girl who had all her limbs amputated after contracting meningitis C as a baby is being treated in hospital for a chest infection.
Kia Gott's mother, Vikki Mitchell, said her daughter had been treated at several hospitals over Christmas. 
She was now in intensive care at Leeds General Infirmary, Ms Mitchell said.
Kia, from Bradford, was only one year old when she was diagnosed with what doctors said was "one of the worst cases of meningitis" they had seen.
Ms Mitchell said Kia was first taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary in December to be treated for her current infection.
But as her condition deteriorated she was taken by air ambulance to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, as it was the nearest intensive care bed available. 
Writing on Facebook on Monday, Ms Mitchell said: "Just setting off to Leeds. Kia had to be put back the ventilator for the journey.
"Leeds ICU will be monitoring her this evening, but things are looking good for our 'warrior' girl, stay strong Kia."
Ms Mitchell later told the BBC that Kia's condition was believed to be improving, but she remained in intensive care.
Meningitis is an infection of the membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.
Kia contracted the condition in 2017 before she could receive the Men C vaccine, which is administered to infants at about 12 months old.
