A 71-year-old man has pleaded guilty to murdering his wife at their home.
Simon Steeves, of Weston Road in Brean, Somerset, stabbed 59-year-old Denise Steeves at Diamond Meadow Lodge Park on 25 October 2023.
He pleaded guilty to murder on Wednesday and will be sentenced on 1 March.
Bristol Crown Court heard Steeves called 999 after the attack and said he had killed his wife.
When police arrived at the couple's home, they arrested him and provided Ms Steeves with CPR. She died at the scene.
At interview, Steeves told police he "did not remember picking up the knife", the court heard.
Det Insp Neil Meade from Avon and Somerset Police said: "My sincere condolences and thoughts remain with the family and loved ones of Denise, who have supported our investigation since the incident in October last year."
"We hope this gives Denise's loved ones some closure, knowing the man who took Denise from them too soon will soon be in jail," he said.
