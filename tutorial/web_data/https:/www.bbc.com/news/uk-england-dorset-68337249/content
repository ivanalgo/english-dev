A clock at a seaside resort is set to be lit up in different colours across the year to highlight good causes.
Weymouth residents were asked by the town council to suggest charities and groups they wanted to light up the Jubilee Clock. 
The council said more than 100 nominations came in with 12 local charities and good causes chosen.
Weymouth Girlguiding is taking part first, lighting the landmark blue from 21 February.
Councillor Kate Wheller, the town's mayor, said: "We have some amazing charities and communities that will be recognised throughout 2024 by the Jubilee Clock.
"It's an outstanding tourist attraction in Weymouth which many people like to photograph, so by lighting it in different colours we hope it will raise awareness about the work of these organisations."
Weymouth Town Council will also light the clock red, white and blue on 6 June to commemorate the 80th anniversary since the D-Day landings.
The free-standing clock tower was built in 1888 to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria and was Grade II Listed in 1974.
