A memorial service to commemorate 13 people who died in an explosion at a munitions factory has taken place 100 years on from the disaster.
Twelve young women and a man were killed when fire ripped through their hut on marshes near Slade Green, south-east London, on 18 February 1924.
Relatives of most of the victims attended the service along with other dignitaries.
It was held at St Augustine's Church in Slade Green from 15:00 GMT.
On the morning of the disaster, 20 girls and women and a man were breaking down Verey lights - cartridge flares used for signalling and lighting at night - in a hut belonging to the Slade Green Filling Factory.
Witnesses reported seeing a bright flash before an explosion ripped through the building.
Most of the female victims, who were aged between 16 and 24 and all lived locally, died after they became trapped inside. 
Another, 17-year-old Edna Allen, made it out but died in hospital that night from her injuries.
The factory foreman, Edward Jones, 29, from Forest Hill, also died when he was overcome by the smoke and flames as he tried to help one of the girl's escape from out of the hut window.
The memorial service has been organised by Mike Smith, whose aunt Amelia was among the dead. 
In a previous appeal to find relatives of the victims, he told the BBC he wanted them to "be recognised for the sacrifice they made".
"If they had died in the trenches it would have been a big deal. Because they died dismantling explosives, it doesn't seem to be so heroic but I don't see it like that," he explained.
Relatives of those who were killed are set to attend the service along with the families of survivors, the Bishop of Rochester, the mayor of Bexley and local MP Sir David Evennett.
