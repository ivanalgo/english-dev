A woman who had fallen overboard from a pleasure vessel has been rescued.
An alarm was raised at about 13.45 BST when the passenger went into the water south of Ventnor on the Isle of Wight.
HM Coastguard said after a rescue operation, which also included RNLI lifeboats, the woman was winched safely out of the water by one of its helicopters at about 16:00.
The woman has been flown to St Mary's Hospital in Newport for a check up. 
The coastguard coordinated the rescue operation with two helicopters and a fixed wing aircraft, alongside RNLI's all-weather lifeboats from Bembridge and Yarmouth, and Sandown and Shanklin Independent Lifeboat.
Two nearby vessels also supported the search.
