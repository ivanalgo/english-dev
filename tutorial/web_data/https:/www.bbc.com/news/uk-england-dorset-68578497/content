Noel Gallagher will play a concert at a venue that hosted an iconic Oasis gig 20 years ago.
Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds will play at the Lighthouse in Poole on Sunday.
It comes two decades after Gallagher and his brother Liam played an intimate gig at the same venue.
The show came just two days before Oasis played a headline set at Glastonbury Festival in 2004.
It was also the debut for the band's new drummer, Zak Starkey - son of Ringo Starr.
Nick Churchill, who was working for a local newspaper at the time of the gig, said he remembered "a lot of excitement" surrounding the 2004 Oasis show - which was the band's first UK concert for over a year.
"People camped out outside the Lighthouse, some of them for two nights, but it was basically an all night party outside the Lighthouse, queued around the corner to get tickets," he said.
Of the concert itself, Mr Churchill said the band was "full of all the vin and brio you would expect from Oasis at their peak", and were "clearly in the mood for it".
Ticket's to Noel Gallagher's return to Poole sold out in just three minutes.
Tim Colegate, head of programming at the Lighthouse, said the concert was "a really nice story of history repeating itself".
He added: "You would never ordinarily see a name like Noel Gallagher playing a venue of our size, so we're punching above our weight a bit.
"But what an intimate gig to be at - how many opportunities do you get to be in such close proximity to a music legend?"
Mr Colegate said one man had even camped out to buy tickets to the show - just as he had done 20 years previous to catch a glimpse of Oasis.
