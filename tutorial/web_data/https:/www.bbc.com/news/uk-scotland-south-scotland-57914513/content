A bravery medal won by a former soldier for storming an enemy gun position in Iraq has sold for £140,000 at auction.
Shaun Garry Jardine, from Dumfries, was part of a quick reaction force which came under attack in August 2003.
His actions let his men move forward and forced the enemy to withdraw.
He was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC) which he has now sold as part of a group of medals to fund the purchase of a family home.
Mr Jardine served as a corporal in the King's Own Scottish Borderers and later the Royal Regiment of Scotland, rising to the rank of warrant officer class 2.
The CGC was awarded for his actions on 9 August 2003, while serving in Maysan Province during the Iraq War.
Facing heavy machine-gun fire, he ordered his team to provide covering fire and then assaulted the enemy positions in succession.
He was praised for his "quick-thinking, courage and inspirational leadership".
Auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb said it was the only CGC to have been awarded to a Scottish regiment.
The medals were auctioned alongside a print of David Rowland's painting of Mr Jardine receiving his CGC and a file containing 15 letters of congratulation.
Christopher Mellor-Hill, head of client liaison at Dix Noonan Webb, said it was pleased with the price achieved.
"We are delighted to see Shaun Jardine's medals sell for a well deserved £140,000, being the unique CGC to a Scottish regiment and also being one of the few remaining CGC awards available to collectors for the Iraq War," he said.
Mr Jardine added:  "I am very happy with the result and what Dix Noonan Webb have done for me to get such a good price for my medals.
"It will really help towards securing a new home for my family."
