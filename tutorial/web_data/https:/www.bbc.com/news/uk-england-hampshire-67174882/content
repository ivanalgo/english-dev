Part of a road near a major motorway junction will be closed for more than three months to repair a landslip.
The eastbound lane of the A334 in Hedge End, near the M27, will shut for 14 weeks from 10 November.
Work to restore the embankment, which collapsed earlier this year, will see traffic diversions put in place.
It has been scheduled ahead of the winter months to prevent cold and wet weather making the slip worse, Hampshire County Council said.
From late October, vegetation will begin to be cleared along Charles Watts Way ahead of the roadworks.
Traffic will be diverted via Kanes Hill A27 to junction 8 of the M27 for Bursledon, with a separate diversion route for non-motorway traffic.
Hampshire County Council acknowledged the repairs would cause disruption in the run-up to the busy Christmas period.
But Councillor Nick Adams-King, lead member for universal services, said the work was essential to keep the road safe.
"We are asking road users to leave more time if they need to travel in this area and plan their journeys accordingly," he said.
