A farm is celebrating the birth of Suffolk punch filly which it said would help boost its bid to protect the breed's future.
Easton Farm Park, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, said the foal, named Iris, was born on 6 April.
Suffolk punch horses are classified as "critically endangered" by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.
The farm said it was "absolutely thrilled" to announce the filly's arrival.
Farm manager Fiona Siddall said Iris was "really thriving" and her mum Ruby was doing "very well".
"They are a rare breed for a reason and it's always a little bit stressful in the run up, so there's nothing more lovely than having a live, healthy Suffolk punch and a filly to boot, that's even better," she said.
The farm said Suffolk punches were classified as a critically endangered breed by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, with fewer than 75 female horses left in the UK and only 300 left in the world.
It said it had a breeding programme to "protect these gentle giants' future".
Ms Siddall said: "Every filly foal that's born brings new hope because when she comes to maturity she can begin to breed.
"We love to breed the horses for the future of this rare and majestic breed."
Elsewhere, a new filly has also been born at Suffolk Punch Trust in Hollesley.
It said the foal, named Jennifer, was born on 3 April and "both mum and baby are doing very well".
According to Suffolk Horse Society (SHS), there are fewer than 500 purebred Suffolk punch horses in the UK, making them more endangered than the giant panda.
