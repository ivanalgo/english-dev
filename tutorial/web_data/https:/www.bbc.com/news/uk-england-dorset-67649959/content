New measures are being introduced at a nature reserve to encourage wildlife to breed.
Dorset Wildlife Trust is creating three ponds at the Kingcombe Meadows nature reserve at Toller Porcorum near Dorchester.
It is hoped the ponds will boost the number of Great Crested Newts - a protected species which is already found on the site.
The works will be funded by DEFRA as part of its Species Recovery Project.
Natural England has agreed to the project for the reserve land, which is partially listed as a site of special scientific interest and special conservation area.
One of the ponds will be located close to Pound Cottage, next to the River Hooke and the other two will sit off Kingcombe Road, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Each pond will be about 10 metres (33ft) wide and roughly circular, with a maximum depth of 1.2 metres (4ft).
