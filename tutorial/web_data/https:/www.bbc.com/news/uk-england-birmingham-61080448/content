An MP said she was shocked to learn her name had been researched by the IS fanatic who murdered Sir David Amess MP.
Ali Harbi Ali was convicted of killing the Southend West MP during a constituency surgery.
Police said, during the early stages of his planning, Ali also researched more than 250 MPs including Jess Phillips.
"[It] puts you right back to all the moments when you're frightened of these sorts of things," the Labour MP said.
No further attack planning was carried out over any other MPs apart from cabinet minister Michael Gove and Finchley MP Mike Freer, a spokesperson for the Met Police said.
The Birmingham Yardley MP said she heard her name "along with the nation" when Ali was convicted of murder and preparing acts of terrorism.
"It has been very chilling since the death of David Amess but it would be nice to know those things," she told BBC Radio WM.
The Met Police said if Ms Phillips had been a target they would have contacted her and they have since clarified their approach with the MP.
Sir David was killed five years after Batley and Spen MP Jo Cox was murdered in her constituency.
In November, a convicted prisoner was further sentenced for sending death threats to Ms Phillips.
Security arrangements for MPs have been reviewed again by police forces and the Birmingham MP said such restrictions do affect her work.
"I already feel more distant from my constituents and their issues than I did when I first started," she said. "I already have to have barriers between me and them."
"It will never chip away at my desire to be near people. What it chips away at is my ability to be near to people, which chips away at my desire to do the job."
