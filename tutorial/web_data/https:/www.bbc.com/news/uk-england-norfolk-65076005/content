Work has started to protect a vulnerable stretch of coastline in the east of England which has been ravaged by erosion in the last few weeks.
About 2,000 tonnes of granite is being placed along a 131ft (40m) section of the cliff at The Marrams in Hemsby, Norfolk.
Five homes at risk of falling into the sea there were demolished recently and a sixth was moved inland.
Great Yarmouth Borough Council said the rock was a "temporary solution".
Plans for a permanent defence stretching 0.8 miles (1.3km) have been granted a licence by the Marine Management Organisation.
However, the council will need to find Â£15m to complete the work.
The area has been battered by high spring tides and strong winds during the last two weeks.
Seven bungalows along The Marrams had to be demolished when the sandy cliffs were washed away in March 2018 and, in December 2013, the worst storm surge in decades destroyed seven homes.
The rock defences have been placed at the section of the access road most at risk, which was used by a number of properties on The Marrams.
