A British Airways plane has made an emergency landing at Manchester Airport after smoke was spotted in the cockpit. 
The aircraft touched down at about 16:55 GMT and was greeted by the airport's firefighters. 
Two other planes were asked to circle the area before being allowed to land. 
Manchester Airport said the manoeuvre was a "precaution" and the smoke was the result of a "minor technical issue".
The flight, number BA1369 from Heathrow to Manchester, was taken to a remote area but passengers were able to leave normally. 
A spokesman for the airport said the runway remained open. 
He told the BBC: "There was never a significant concern. British Airways will be looking at what caused the smoke."
A representative for British Airways said: "Our flight crew requested a priority landing due to a minor technical issue. The aircraft landed safely and customers disembarked normally."
