A policeman and a male pedestrian have been taken to hospital after being struck by a car that skidded on ice.
The officer was attending a report of a collision in Portglenone on Saturday morning when the incident happened.
Paramedics and air ambulance attended the scene at Ballymacombs Road shortly after 09:35 GMT.
"It is not believed at this time that the injuries are life threatening," a spokesperson for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said. 
"Icy conditions are to be expected over the coming days across Northern Ireland and we would like to take this opportunity to advise road users to exercise caution when on the roads," said the PSNI.
"Stopping distances increase greatly when weather conditions are poor, so slow down and leave a bigger gap between your vehicle and the vehicle in front," he added.
