A statue of environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg has returned to a university's grounds after it was removed for repairs.
Installed in 2021, the Â£24,000 statue faced criticism from some students at the University of Winchester for being a "vanity project."
The life-sized artwork was removed last year for repairs to its plinth. 
The university said it can now be seen by the public in the courtyard garden of its West Downs Centre.
At the time of its initial installation, students from the Winchester University and College Union (UCU) called it a a vanity project and questioned if the money could have been better spent.
The university believed it was the world's first life-sized sculpture of the "inspirational" Swedish environmental activist.
A University of Winchester spokesperson said: "As previously reported the statue was removed for repair and has been placed in the West Downs courtyard garden as planned, 
"Where it can still be seen and enjoyed by the public along with the other works of art found on campus."
The 21-year-old S climate activist has become one of the world's best-known environmental campaigners since she held a "School Strike for Climate" outside the Swedish parliament in 2018.
In November she pleaded not guilty to a public order offence after she was arrested at a protest in central London in October.
