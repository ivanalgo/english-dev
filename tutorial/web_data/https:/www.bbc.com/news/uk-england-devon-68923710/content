A developer has withdrawn plans to remove a woodland area in north Devon after more than 250 objections.
Persimmon Homes had proposed to create a footpath and cycle way in place of a woodland buffer zone in Bideford. 
The developer apologised to residents after scrapping the proposal between Appledore Grove and its new 200-home estate at Clovelly Road.
Councillor David Brenton said the woodland and wildlife area was "sacrosanct".
The Local Democracy Reporting Service said Torridge District Council granted consent for the homes, including 40 affordable dwellings, in February.
Persimmon said its plans would help "alleviate pressure" on Torridge District Council's 2,000-strong housing list.
It said: "However, we acknowledge the concerns raised during our recent consultation regarding the footpath diversion at the site.
"We are actively engaging with the local authority to explore potential alternative routes that will not compromise the development and its biodiversity net gain provision."
It said it had now submitted a new application for the path which would be within its development, "minimising habitat loss".
The company said it planned to include 1.4 hectares of open space, including parks, sports and recreation grounds, a community orchard, and play spaces for children.
Mr Brenton said: "The developers had proposed a 4m footpath right down through the wildlife area. It was big enough to drive an articulated lorry through.
"They got planning permission to build new houses that included this sacrosanct area and were not allowed to infringe it, but they came back for a second bite of the cherry."
Councillor Simon Inch said people had been "very upset" by the application and there had been no consultation with the residents.
He said he was "pleased" Persimmon had withdrawn the application but would keep "a close eye" on what they intended to do next.
