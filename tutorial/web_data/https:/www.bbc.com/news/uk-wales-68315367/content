A man has been arrested on suspicion of fraud after a group of charity trekkers claimed he left them stranded abroad.
A total of 26 hikers paid Aspire Adventures, based in Brynrefail, Gwynedd, up to Â£3,500 each to scale Mount Kilimanjaro and cover costs for accommodation, equipment and guides.
After landing in Tanzania, they found out that no services would be provided. 
North Wales Police said a 49-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation.
By scaling Africa's highest mountain, most of the hiking group were intending to raise money for Hope4, which helps Ukrainian refugees and orphans in Moldova.
Trekkers were forced set up a GoFundMe page so they could continue with the trip, as well as using their own savings and borrowing money from relatives.
North Wales Police said its investigation was ongoing.
