A man has been arrested on suspicion of committing grievous bodily harm after an Uber driver was stabbed in south London.
The Met Police said the driver was stabbed twice in the chest in Balham in the early hours of last Thursday.
It followed other incidents in October and November where women were targeted in Clapham Junction, Brixton and Balham.
The previous incidents involved stalking and approaching with knives.
The Uber driver, who was attacked on 23 November, has been released from hospital and does not have life-threatening injuries.
Police said a 22-year-old man was arrested in Brixton on Friday.
At the same address, a man in his 30s was arrested on suspicion of burglary in relation to an unrelated ongoing investigation.
Det Supt Dan O'Sullivan from the South West Command Unit said: "We recognise these incidents will have caused a lot of concern within the local community and wider and we are working around the clock to fully investigate the circumstances surrounding them.
"These are extremely serious offences that will have had a profound impact on the victims. Tackling violence against women and girls is a priority for the force and we continue to pursue a number of enquiries in order to hold those responsible to account."
