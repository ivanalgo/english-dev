Six more Labour councillors have quit the party after comments from Sir Keir Starmer on the Israel-Hamas war.The news comes after two members of Oxford City Council left the party last weekend.Councillors Imogen Thomas, Edward Mundy, Paula Dunne, Duncan Hall, Dr Hosnieh Djafari-Marbini and Jabu Nala-Hartley all resigned on Friday evening.They cited the Labour leadership's "refusal to condemn collective punishment of Palestinians".In a collective statement the councillors said: "At a time when it's been crucial to call for an immediate ceasefire and a de-escalation, and to insist Israel abides by international law, Keir Starmer and the shadow foreign secretary have instead endorsed collective punishment, blockade, siege and mass civilian casualties."As Starmer has said, 'Israel has that right' to continue deadly attacks on Gazans. This is complicity in war crimes."The statement continued: "We have been proud to represent our communities and do not take the decision to resign from Labour lightly."In a choice between serving our parties or justice, we have chosen justice."The councillors will now all represent their wards as Independents.
Sir Keir said Hamas "bears responsibility".Speaking to LBC, from the Labour party conference earlier this month, he said Israel "does have that right" to withhold power and water from Palestinian civilians, though "everything should be done within international law".On Friday, the Labour leader wanted to clarify his comments, saying: "I was not saying that Israel had the right to cut off water, food, fuel or medicines."On the contrary. For over a week now, I have been leading the charge calling for that humanitarian aid to come in."Sir Keir has met with councillors as he works to repair the damage caused by the remarks on the politically fraught subject.The most recent resignations come after fellow Oxford City councillors Shaista Aziz and Amar Latif quit on 14 October in reaction to the comments.Council leader Susan Brown said she was "disappointed" by their decision but added: "Keir Starmer has reiterated this week that Israel has the right to defend itself, but must act in accordance with international law."

In her statement on their decision, Ms Brown said: "We all abhor the barbaric terrorist attacks committed by Hamas, and Labour stands in solidarity with the innocent civilians in Israel and Gaza in the face of continuing violence and suffering through lack of basic necessities. We are all hoping for a peaceful outcome soon."She added: "Oxford Labour continues to support out local Jewish and Muslim communities, who are both grieving. It is also vital that we all play our part in ensuring that Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia have no place in our city and we will continue to support all of Oxford's faith communities."
