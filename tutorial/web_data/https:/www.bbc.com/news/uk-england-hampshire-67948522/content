Several tips have been earmarked for closure in a bid to save a council millions of pounds.
Household waste recycling centres in Alresford, Bishop's Waltham, Fair Oak, Hartley Wintney and Hayling Island were found to be the most expensive to run by Hampshire County Council.
Sites in Aldershot, Bordon, Casbrook, Hedge End, Marchwood, Petersfield and Somerley are also at risk.
The authority said the closures would save £1.6 million per year.
The changes were revealed under a cost-cutting plan to meet the council's predicted £132 million budget shortfall by April 2025.
Operational challenges, poor performance and investment requirements were also reasons given for shutting down the 12 sites.
Under the plans, the opening times and types of waste accepted could also change at some tips.
Staff employed by Veolia, which manages the sites, could face job losses as a result.
Hampshire County Council said it had considered reducing the opening hours of tips, with an estimated saving of £1.2 million per year, but said that would result in each site across the county closing for three days per week.
It was also contemplating bringing in new fees, such as "premium booking slots".
Conservative-run Hampshire County Council previously said it was under "immense pressure" to balance its budget.
Public consultation on the plans is open 31 March.
