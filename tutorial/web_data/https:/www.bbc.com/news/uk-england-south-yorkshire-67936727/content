Singer Self Esteem's limited edition T-shirts, which feature the dome of Sheffield's Meadowhall shopping centre, have gone global.
Inspired by what the artist wore at Glastonbury in 2022, the T-shirts went on sale at Meadowhall with profits donated to charity Breast Cancer Now.
A new version of the T-shirt can now be bought online by fans across the world.
Self Esteem, whose real name is Rebecca Lucy Taylor, said she hoped to "make a real difference for a great charity".
The T-shirts, which were exclusively on sale in white at Meadowhall, can now be bought in black from the official Self Esteem website.
A limited number of the original design is still available at the shopping centre.
The design of the T-shirts is based on the silicone bra worn by the Rotherham-born singer-songwriter at Glastonbury in 2022.
The cups replicated the glass dome of the shopping centre, which she said had held a special place in her heart since childhood.
The 37-year-old added: "I was blown away by the reaction to the outfit after Glastonbury, especially after wearing something that was so personal to me. 
"But to be able to take that iconic image and use it to raise awareness and funds for such an incredibly important cause, that really is special." 
Centre director at Meadowhall, Darren Pearce, said he felt "so proud" that the centre had left "such a positive impression" on the singer.
The T-shirts were created in collaboration with Ollie Spragley, the designer of the original Glastonbury outfit, whose mother died of breast cancer 10 years ago.
