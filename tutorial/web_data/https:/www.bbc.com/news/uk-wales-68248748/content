A self-portrait by Vincent van Gogh is to go on display in Wales for the first time.
The Dutch master's 1887 Portrait Of The Artist will go on display at the National Museum Cardiff in March.
The van Gogh will be on display as part of a new exhibition, Art Of The Selfie, which explores if self-portrait is the original selfie.
The work, which is normally housed at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, will go on display until January 2025.
The impressionist is one of the most recognisable faces in Western art, painting 35 self-portraits before his death at the age of 37.
It is part of a reciprocal loan with France, with Museum Wales' La Parisienne by Renoir, also known as The Blue Lady, making a journey across the Channel.Â 
Deputy Culture and Sport Minister Dawn Bowden described it as a fitting way to close the Year Of Wales In France, to create ties between the two countries in trade, culture and sport.
Joining the van Gogh will be a selection from artists in the national collection of Wales, including Rembrandt, Brenda Chamberlain, Francis Bacon, Bedwyr Williams and Anya Paintsil.
Dr Kath Davies, director of collections and research at the Cardiff museum, said visitors will enjoy seeing work by one of the world's best-known painters alongside collections in Wales.
