The cost of a standard adult passport in Guernsey is to increase from £93 to £100 from 1 June.
A standard child's passport will increase in price from £64 to £69.
Fast-track passport application fees will also cost more, with an adult's going up to £166.50, and a child's rising to £135.50.
The Border Agency said the charges would bring Guernsey's passport pricing inline with the UK and other Crown Dependencies.
It added standard passport applications were taking approximately seven weeks to process.
Agency bosses are warning people to allow ample time for their application to be processed if they want to avoid paying the fast-track application fee.
