Students in Newcastle have agreed to move towards 100% plant-based catering.
Newcastle University's Student Council voted to ensure 50% of food is plant-based at its ticketed events, increasing to 100% where possible.
The move is part of the Plant-Based University campaign, which has seen 10 other student union passing similar proposals.
Universities including Edinburgh, York and Cardiff are among those to have rejected proposals.
The vote held on Thursday means work will be carried out alongside the students' union to lobby the whole university to make the steps towards 100% plant-based catering.
Ella Spray, Plant-Based Universities' Newcastle coordinator said it was important the university played a part in mitigating climate change.
She added: "Climate anxiety is at an all-time high and this motion gives students a chance to show the university that they want decisive action to be taken to sustainability.
"We are excited about working with the students' union and the wider student community to make these changes work for everyone."
Newcastle University said all catering venues and events across the site already provided daily plant-based options.
A spokesman added: "The university looks forward to working with the student body to further promote sustainable living."
Plant-Based University believes a move to a plant-based food system globally could free up about 76% of farmland for rewilding. 
Last year, similar plans to move to plant-based catering by the same campaign group at Edinburgh University were turned down.
At the time, the Countryside Alliance group spoke out against the motion, urging Edinburgh University students to support "sustainable farming communities" as well as "freedom of choice" by voting against the proposals.
