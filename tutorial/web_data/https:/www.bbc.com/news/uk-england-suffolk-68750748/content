A road was cordoned off after a man planting vegetables in his garden dug up a wartime grenade.
The device, believed to date from World War Two, was found by Harry Fox in Pakefield, Lowestoft, Suffolk, at about 13:00 BST.
His wife Lauren said they informed the police and a bomb disposal team arrived at about 17:00.
They "checked it and confirmed it was ok", but took it away as it had "traces of explosives", she said. 
Residents in All Saints Road were told to stay indoors until the device was secured. 
Mrs Fox, an NHS IT analyst, said: "Harry and his dad were digging up the garden to plant vegetables when he found the grenade.
"He picked it up and identified it by its markings, so he got in touch with the police and they advised him to leave it."
Officers cordoned off the road until the bomb disposal team arrived to check the grenade. 
Suffolk Police has been approached for comment.
