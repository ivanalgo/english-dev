An investigation has been launched after police trousers were found on an online marketplace for buying and selling clothes. 
Hertfordshire Constabulary has alleged that Insp Owen Hurley took payment for the trousers.
The police said the officer's behaviour may have amounted to "gross misconduct".
The force was contacted in July 2023 by a member of the public who had spotted the trousers being sold on Vinted.
A misconduct hearing will take place at the Hertfordshire Constabulary headquarters in Welwyn Garden City on 6 February.
