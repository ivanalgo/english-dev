Police who manage closures around crashes in part of Derbyshire's Peak District say "audacious" drivers have been moving cones in a bid to drive through their roadblocks.
Repeated incidents at the scenes of collisions across High Peak have led Derbyshire Police officers to issue a plea to motorists.
Officers say closures are put in force to keep emergency workers safe.
They added trying to drive through a closure was a criminal offence.
The Hope Valley beat team says anyone doing so faces a fine or worse.
"Officers have asked a number of motorists what they were thinking, after motorists decided they would move cones and signs," the team said.
"Offending drivers have argued with officers stating their inconvenience of having to find an alternative route and they 'can fit through the cones' therefore they deem it acceptable to drive through a road closure.
"For those road users be aware that you could get anything from a fixed penalty through to prosecution for careless driving.
"Observe the signs when you see them, we certainly do not put them out for a laugh.
"Always follow diversions and show respect to all the emergency services who attend these incidents  - they alongside us have a job to do."
