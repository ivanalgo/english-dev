A doctor accused of attempted murder in a suspected poisoning has also been charged with making and using the chemical weapon ricin.
Thomas Kwan was charged with the attempted murder of Patrick O'Hara in Newcastle, after a property was searched in Ingleby Barwick, Stockton.
He has since been charged with the production and use of a chemical weapon, between 1 and 22 January.
Mr Kwan, 52, of Brading Court, appeared at Newcastle Crown Court on Wednesday.
He appeared by video link and spoke only to confirm his name and that he understood proceedings. 
Mr Kwan, a GP in Sunderland, did not enter a plea.
A provisional trial date was set for 29 July and Hong Kong-born Mr Kwan, who is a married father-of-one, was remanded in custody.
No application for bail was made by the defence.
The court has previously heard Mr O'Hara was not one of Mr Kwan's patients.
