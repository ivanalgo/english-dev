Volunteers have taken a bevy of swans under their wing after watching them repeatedly try to cross a busy road.
A so-called Swan Patrol was set up for the family of birds, which lives in Bishop's Waltham, Hampshire, following the deaths of two cygnets that were hit by cars.
Locals now work in shifts to help the remaining five cygnets and two adults navigate the traffic.
The 11 volunteers stop cars and assist the birds safely across the B2177.
The team stared work in September, with volunteers working in shifts from 06:45 BST until sunset.
Locals said the swans crossed Winchester Road together as often as five times a day because there are ponds on either side.
Volunteer Deane Bevan described the road as a "rat run" and said three swans had been hit by vehicles there - but only one had survived. 
Mr Bevan said: "They come to our village to have families every year - but every year the traffic increases a bit more... drivers just need to slow down a bit."
Steve Clark, another volunteer, only moved to the area two years ago, but very quickly realised the swans were important to the town.
"I remember walking across the footbridge with my partner earlier this year and you could see these teeny weeny things, all grey and fluffy," he said.
Mr Clark, who is semi-retired, decided to join the patrols because he had some spare time on his hands.
He said: "I do a few hours on a Monday and a Tuesday - we all jump in when we can, it's quite informal.
"We're not there to police things or tell people what to do, we just want to help the swans cross the road," he added.
