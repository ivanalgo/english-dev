A Â£7.6m plan to upgrade a Victorian library housing historic documents from around the world has been approved.
Manchester City Council will allow a series of "sensitive adaptations" to update the Grade I-listed John Rylands Research Institute and Library.
The University of Manchester wants to improve facilities for its research, public events and visitors to its special collections.
The project - John Rylands Next Chapter - is a part of its Imagine2030 vision.
The university said the work would "enhance its contribution to research, student experience and public engagement".
The proposed designs would deliver an updated exhibition space, an advanced imaging laboratory, a flexible event space and a refreshed main entrance incorporating its evolution through the 1890s, 1920s, 1960s and 2000s.
Considered one of the finest neo-Gothic buildings in Europe, it houses internationally important collections of rare books, manuscripts, and archives - including the oldest portion of the Gospel of John and manuscripts from the celebrated novelist Elizabeth Gaskell. 
Prof Christopher Pressler, John Rylands university librarian and director of The University of Manchester library, said the plans "will equip the Rylands to address the many challenges and opportunities of the mid-21st century, and it will reinforce the Rylands' importance to the university, the city of Manchester, and world heritage".
The Rylands is expected to stay open throughout the project, with areas closing as required.
The last time a major refurbishment took place, four million books and manuscripts were stored in a Cheshire salt mine to protect them while work was carried out.
The library was constructed as a memorial to the textile multi-millionaire and philanthropist John Rylands by his widow, Enriqueta, who built it to rival those of Oxford and Cambridge.
