Police investigating the murder of a man whose partial remains were found off a cliff-side path and in public gardens have started new searches.
The remains were found in the Boscombe area of Bournemouth off the Manor Steps Zig Zag path on 26 August, and Boscombe Chine Gardens on 6 September.
The victim was identified as Simon Shotton, 49, from Bournemouth.
Debbie Pereira, 38, and Benjamin Atkins, 48, both also from the town, were charged with murder in September.
The pair are due to stand trial at Winchester Crown Court on 10 April.
Dorset Police said the searches were being carried out in Walpole Lane.
The lane is about half a mile (900m) from the Manor Steps Zig Zag, off Boscombe Overcliff Drive and about 630m from Boscombe Chine Gardens.
The force said the lane had been cordoned off.
