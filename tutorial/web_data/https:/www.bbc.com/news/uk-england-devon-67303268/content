A woman has died after a car was found in the River Tavy on Thursday morning near Roborough, police have said.
Search and rescue teams searched the river and surrounding areas and "are content that no other person was in the vehicle".
The emergency services were called at 09:55 GMT but it was unclear when the car entered the water although it is not thought to be weather related.
Officers said the woman was pronounced dead in hospital.
She was extracted from the car by firefighters from Camels Head and Crownhill.
A spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall Police said the woman's next of kin have been informed and the death was not being treated as suspicious.
"The death is being treated as unexplained at this time and officers are conducting enquiries into the circumstances surrounding the incident.
"The car was secured by the fire service and has since been recovered."
Plymouth RNLI said it was called to join a search at about 11:50.
The ambulance service and HM Coastguard also attended along with Dartmoor Search and Rescue Teams from Tavistock and Plymouth.
