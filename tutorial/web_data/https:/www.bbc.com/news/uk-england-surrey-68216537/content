Surrey's MPs have taken to social media to express support for King Charles III following his cancer diagnosis.
It was discovered during recent treatment for an enlarged prostate.
One message came from South West Surrey MP and chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who has survived cancer himself, but lost his brother and parents to the disease.
Mr Hunt wrote: "Cancer is a horrible disease. We all pray it has been caught early enough for him to continue his remarkable life of service."
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the BBC he's in "regular contact" with the King and was thankful the illness was "caught early".
Mr Hunt, also a former health secretary, revealed in June 2022 he had been successfully treated for skin cancer.
His brother died in August 2023, three years after being diagnosed with a sarcoma, while both their parents died of cancer.
Runnymede and Weybridge MP Dr Ben Spencer wrote on X: "A cancer diagnosis is a worrying time for anyone affected.
"I wish his Majesty all the best for his treatment and thinking of him and his family."
Esher and Walton MP and former deputy prime minister Dominic Raab said: "Wishing His Majesty the King a swift recovery. The Royal family are in our thoughts and prayers."
Guildford MP Angela Richardson, who has taken part in Cancer Research UK's Race For Life in the town with Mr Hunt, wrote on Facebook: "Sending my best wishes to His Majesty for a good outcome following his diagnosis."
