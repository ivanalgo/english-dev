The decision to build a new waste-to-energy incinerator has not changed despite plans being removed online.
On Tuesday, the secretary of state approved MVV Environment plans to build the plant in Wisbech, near the Cambridgeshire-Norfolk border.
This decision was later taken off the Planning Inspectorate website, pending "clarification".
Documentation has since been reinstated and no alterations have been made.
Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho granted development consent on Tuesday 20 February. 
But the inspectorate later removed information about the decision from its website on Wednesday evening, promising a further update "in due course".
The "decided" status of the application on the webpage was changed back to "decision", suggesting it was now yet to be made.
A notice on the site read: "We have removed previously published content. Clarification is being sought on the Medworth Energy from Waste Combined Heat and Power Facility Development Consent Decision.
"A further update will be provided in due course."
A  spokesperson for the Planning Inspectorate said: "Following publication of the announcement and documents relating to the Medworth Energy from Waste Facility DCO, clarification was required. 
"Whilst that clarification process took place, information relating to the decision was removed from the website. 
"The announcement and relevant documentation have now been reinstated, with no alterations having been made."
Fenland District Council has agreed to investigate the option of challenging the plans at a judicial review.
