Vandals have caused £3,000 damage to a racquet sports court in a public park when they smashed its glass enclosure.
It happened at the padel court at Great Baddow Recreation Ground, near Chelmsford.
Officers from the Chelmsford Community Policing Team said 14 trees were also destroyed near the court.
"The glass will cost in excess of £3,000 to be replaced and the 12-year-old trees will need to be removed, costing time and money," they said.
In a post on social media, police added that residents were "so lucky to have" the award-winning recreation ground.
"Damage like this affects individuals, families and social groups and has an impact on communities and wildlife," they said.
