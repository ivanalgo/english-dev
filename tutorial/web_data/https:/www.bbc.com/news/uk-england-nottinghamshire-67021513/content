Work is set to start on a new £26m scheme to protect a Nottinghamshire village that has flooded six times since 1999. 
People in Lowdham had their homes and businesses flooded in 1999, 2007, 2012, 2013, 2019 and in 2020 when Cocker Beck, a tributary of the River Trent, burst its banks. 
The Environment Agency is to start work on a new flood storage reservoir.
The work should be finished by spring 2026.
The reservoir will hold 100,000 cubic metres of water and the Environment Agency predicts it will provide nearly £50m worth of benefits to the village and the local economy by preventing future floods. 
A groundbreaking ceremony is due to take place on Friday.
Paul Lockhart, area flood and coastal risk manager at the Environment Agency, said: "We are delighted that we are now in the position of being able to commence the construction of a major Flood Alleviation Scheme to protect the people of Lowdham.  
"The reservoir we are building will provide a very high level of protection against flooding to 191 properties, and it represents excellent value for money for the taxpayer."
