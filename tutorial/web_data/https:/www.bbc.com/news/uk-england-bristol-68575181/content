At any point over a weekend there are dozens of photographers out and about in Bristol capturing snapshots of life, from news to sport and live entertainment.
Here is a selection of images taken in the city this weekend.
Ready to go: People getting into the spirit of the day before the Bristol St Patrick's Day parade set off on its route through the city centre on Sunday.
Packing them in: Holly Humberstone and the audience at the Bristol Beacon on Friday night. The venue recently revealed it had welcomed 100,000 visitors to 75 different events since reopening in November.
Spinning around: The Elmgrove Centre in Redland hosted a special fundraiser on Friday night, a sell-out ceilidh in aid of the Somerset Wildlands Trust, the dancers entertained by the band Fitty Gomash. It was part of a series of events to mark World Rewilding Day.
Save this space: A new campaign called "Roots of Resilience" is calling for more protection for the shared spaces of Bristol, including from the threat of council-owned areas being sold off to make up a budget shortfall. People are being asked to write on ribbons being tied at places such as Windmill Hill City Farm (above) to say what the places mean to them.
Come fly with me: A woman dressed as Amelia Earhart poses with a plane at Aerospace Bristol. The venue is using actors to bring history to life as it tells the story of flight throughout the decades during the Easter holidays.
Now he's come for Easter: The Grinch warms up for his part in the Easter celebrations at Avon Valley Wildlife Park in Keynsham. The venue is holding multiple events over the holiday, including an after-dark Easter egg hunt for adults.
