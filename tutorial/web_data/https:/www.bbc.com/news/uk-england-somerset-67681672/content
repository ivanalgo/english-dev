Work to build dozens of new homes near a Somerset town could be begin within months after plans were approved.
Gleeson Strategic Land was given the green light for the 75 homes to the south of Midsomer Norton.
The site was sold several times before being bought by Mendip District Council, which has now been replaced by Somerset Council.
The authority gained final approval for detailed planning permission meaning work can begin.
Planning officer Jennifer Alvis said: "The scheme will ... include a mixture of housing types and social and affordable dwellings."
She added: "There are no adverse impacts as a result of the proposals which would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits that will be delivered."
The site lies on the northern side of Beauchamps Drive, a short distance from both Norton Down Methodist Church and the White Post Inn.
Of the 75 new homes being proposed, 23 will be affordable, meeting the council's target of 30% affordable housing for any new development of ten homes or more.
It has been promised that pedestrian and cycling routes will be provided throughout the site.
The development will also make contributions towards the town's primary schools, play areas and new bus stops along the A367.
Midsomer Norton lies within the Bath and North East Somerset (BANES) Council area, but many sites on the edges of the town are allocated for housing within Mendip's Local Plan Part II, which was approved in December 2021.
