Counting is under way in the by-election for the Tiverton and Honiton parliamentary constituency in Devon.
The election was triggered when former Conservative MP Neil Parish resigned his seat after admitting watching pornography in Parliament.
There are eight candidates standing in the election, which saw polling stations across the constituency open until 22:00 GMT.
The result of the election is expected in the early hours of Friday.
