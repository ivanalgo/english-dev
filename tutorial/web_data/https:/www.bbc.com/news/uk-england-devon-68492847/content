Street marshals are to remain in Barnstaple and Ilfracombe after claims they are having a positive impact.
North Devon Council strategy and resources committee has agreed £27,000 can be used to keep the scheme going to the end of June.
The council said it would uphold the scheme whilst additional funding was sought.
However, some councillors were concerned about funding the marshals for up to another two years.
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the council was also considering whether it should run the service itself rather than employing a security firm.
Councillors said the street marshals, who work in pairs, had made Barnstaple safer, particularly for women and elderly people.
North Devon Council has funded street marshals after government cash from the Safer Streets programme ran out.
Councillor Malcolm Prowse, said it was also about the regeneration of the local area.
"If we didn't have the street marshals, the £12m we had to regenerate the town could be lost. Barnstaple is a completely difference place from three years ago. It is a town we can be proud of."
However, Councillor Glyn Lane said: "We have a police presence in Barnstaple and Ilfracombe, shop security, security in Green Lanes shopping centre and CCTV plus an environmental health team in Barnstaple town centre. 
"How effective are the street marshals when we have all this?"
Parish and town councils are being asked if they want their areas to be included in the scheme and contribute towards it like Barnstaple Town Council is set to do.
