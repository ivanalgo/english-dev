A procession has been held in memory of railway workers who joined the military and later died in war.
Royal Marines from 40 Commando honoured the veterans in Bishops Lydeard railway station in Somerset on Saturday.
They delivered the Roll of Honour, which bears the names of the former Great Western Railway staff who died.
Laurie Hockley, who lost his great uncle in the war, said: "It's quite harrowing, the number of people that are on there."Â 
Mr Hockley's relative, John Yockney Burchell, was a teenager when he died.
His name is listed on the Roll of Honour, which has recorded the names of the veterans for more than 100 years.
When World War One began in 1914, about 25,000 Great Western Railway employees left their careers on the railway to fight for their country.
Over the course of the war, 2,500 of those lost their lives.
Allan Stanistreet, who works as a researcher, said: "The First World War now has faded into oblivion because there are no survivors and there are fewer and fewer survivors from the Second World War. 
"We have to remember them because without them we wouldn't have the freedom to enjoy today."
