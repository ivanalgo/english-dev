London's Paddington station has been shut for Christmas Eve, while most services from Kings Cross have been cancelled due to engineering works.
Paddington will be shut until Thursday.
Network Rail said the work was necessary and that it had tried to "keep disruption to a minimum".
Although the rail closures are expected to cause disruption to passengers, Network Rail said more than 96% of the rail network would remain open for "business as usual".
It added the closures were needed as part of Â£127m of investment work "so that passengers can benefit from better and more reliable services and facilities".

Transport for London has also published details of the planned works, closures and service changes that will affect journeys over the Christmas period.

A spokesperson from transport watchdog London TravelWatch said: "We recognise that engineering work needs to take place regularly on the railway, especially around safety-critical maintenance of tracks and signalling. 
"So, it's good to see this work is taking place over the Christmas holidays, when fewer people tend to travel and it will hopefully be less disruptive.
"Passengers need clear and timely advice from transport companies and Network Rail, so they don't get caught out if they do need to travel over the festive period."
Network Rail advised passengers to check before travelling. It said any alternative arrangements that were in place could be found online at National Rail Enquiries.
