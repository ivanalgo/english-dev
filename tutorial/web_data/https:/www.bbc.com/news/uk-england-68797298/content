A memorial is to be installed in honour of disabled hospital patients whose graves are marked by tiny iron crosses.
The cemetery at Nayland, on the Suffolk and Essex border, has a small section dedicated to former residents of the Jane Walker Hospital.
The graves were marked with small iron crosses, many of which have become damaged or disappeared completely.
Last year, former staff at the Jane Walker began a fundraising campaign for a headstone for those buried.
More than Â£3,000 was raised for the memorial, which will be unveiled with a blessing at the cemetery on Thursday.
The headstone, made by Hunnaball Funeral Directors, features an image of the former hospital and says the "beautiful people" of the hospital will be "always remembered".
Most of the patients at the long defunct hospital were left there and forgotten by their families, said Tom Weston, who worked as a nurse at the hospital and now lives in Colchester, Essex.
"The unveiling will be a moving experience but also a shared dream come to fruition," said Mr Weston. "These were special people and Jane Walker was a special place at a special time for those of us who worked there."
He said he expected "quite a few people" to attend the service, adding many friendships had been renewed amongst former staff as a result of the memorial appeal.
