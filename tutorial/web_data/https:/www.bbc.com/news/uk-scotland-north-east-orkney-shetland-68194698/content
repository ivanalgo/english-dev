A mandolin and guitar player from Aberdeenshire who also sings has been named the BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician of 2024.
Calum McIlroy, 26, of Westhill, came out on top after six finalists took part at Glasgow's City Halls on Sunday.
"Winning this prestigious award is incredible," he said.
The BBC Radio Scotland contest is regarded as one of the biggest platforms for emerging talent in traditional music.
"It means a lot to me," he said.
"This competition has done so much to help foster and develop young talent within the Scottish traditional music sector and I'm proud to be in the company of all the amazing previous winners."
Calum first learned about traditional music in his school ceilidh band.
Presenter Joy Dunlop - from BBC Scotland's weather team, and a musician herself - said: "Calum is a truly worthy winner of this year's BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician award - and we hope this recognition which will lead to more success for him.
"All our finalists performed incredibly this year and they all deserve praise for their contribution to the traditional music scene in Scotland."
Organised by BBC Radio Scotland, the Young Traditional Musician competition has been increasing the profile of Scottish traditional music and recognising rising talent in the genre since 2001.
It has been a springboard for numerous Scottish traditional music exponents to international acclaim.
Last year's winner was Shetland pianist Amy Laurenson.
She joined a list which has included amongst others the 2022 winner fiddler Eryn Rae, pianist Michael Biggins, piper Ali Levack, fiddler Benedict Morris and singer Hannah Rarity.
