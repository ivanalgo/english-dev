A severely disabled Derbyshire boy has been given a "life-changing" seat to help with his breathing following a fundraiser. 
Eight-year-old Patrick has a rare brain condition and needed the seat - a P Pod - to keep him angled in the correct position.
His mother Victoria said she had been "terrified" about the prospect of the winter without the piece of equipment.
The Â£2,200 chair was delivered on Friday after being funded by donations.
Patrick, from Ilkeston, who cannot walk, talk, sit up or hold up his own head, needs to be fed through a tube into his stomach and has a dislocated hip.
Victoria said: "We're so happy. The new chair is life-changing. It's impossible to be able to afford something of that price. 
"It's going to make everything so much more comfortable for him. 
"I know Patrick would suffer without a P Pod and I feel his health will deteriorate more quickly. 
"It's a vital piece of equipment - there are so many reasons why we needed one for him that fits him."
The seat was funded by members of the public following an appeal by Staffordshire-based Newlife the Charity for Disabled Children.
Victoria had been unable to leave Patrick's side and said the responsibility of watching him for even a minute was too much to ask of his siblings.
She added: "He can't sit unaided and requires it to be sat at the correct angle. 
"We've been waiting since August last year for the chair, so when we received it we were all so happy. 
"It's thanks to the help of everyone that we've been able to get the chair for him. We will be forever grateful."
