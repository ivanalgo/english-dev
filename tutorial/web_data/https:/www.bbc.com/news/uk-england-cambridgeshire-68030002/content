A drug dealer who was caught with almost £2,000 worth of class A drugs in his pants has been jailed.
Kevy Kabula was arrested in Peterborough by plain-clothed officers.
Cambridgeshire Constabulary said the 20-year-old had 127 wraps of crack cocaine and 60 wraps of heroin concealed in his underwear, along with cocaine in his trouser pocket, £412 in cash and three mobile phones.
He was sentenced to four years at Cambridge Crown Court on Thursday.
Investigating officer Det Con Rhiann Ward said: "This was a great spot and proactive work by our neighbourhood support team who intercepted a drug deal in an area of the city we know to have issues with drug dealing."
Kabula was searched in North Street on 4 December because officers believed they had witnessed a dug deal.
The street value of the drugs in his pants was estimated at £1,870.
Analysis of his mobile phones showed regular travel between London and Peterborough and evidence of running a drugs line between the two cities, police said.
Kabula, of Darndale Close, Walthamstow, east London, admitted possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and heroin, and being concerned in the supply of crack cocaine and heroin.
Anyone with concerns or information about drugs can report online via the force's dedicated drugs information webpage.
