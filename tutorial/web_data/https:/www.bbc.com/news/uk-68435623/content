An inquest into the death of Thomas Kingston, husband of Lady Gabriella and son-in-law of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, will begin on Friday.
Gloucestershire Coroner's Court announced that Mr Kingston's death would be examined from 1 March.
He died suddenly on 25 February aged 45 in the Cotswolds, Gloucestershire.
The death is not being treated as suspicious and no one else was involved.
Mr Kingston married Lady Gabriella in 2019 in a ceremony attended by Queen Elizabeth II.
The court said the senior coroner for Gloucestershire, Ms Katy Skerrett, would conduct the opening of the inquest.
King Charles and Queen Camilla sent their "most heartfelt thoughts and prayers" to his family.
Lady Gabriella, 42, paid tribute to her late husband in a statement issued by Buckingham Palace, describing him as an "exceptional man who lit up the lives of all who knew him".
The death was described as a "great shock to the whole family".
Lady Gabriella, not a working member of the Royal Family, is the daughter of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent - with Prince Michael, aged 81, being a grandson of King George V and first cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth II.
Her parents Prince and Princess Michael of Kent were present at the service for the late former King Constantine of Greece at St George's Chapel on Tuesday.
