Three teenagers have been arrested after an eighth-floor hotel fire. 
Crews were called to the blaze involving bedding and a mattress at the Travelodge on Stanhope Road in  Portsmouth at 23:15 GMT on Tuesday.
Guests from the 157-bedroom hotel were evacuated. One person was treated for shortness of breath due to exertion from going down the stairs. 
Police said two women, aged 18 and 19, and a man aged 18 were arrested on suspicion of arson with intent. 
The two women have also been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of violence.
Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary said the 18-year-old man, 19-year-old woman from Portsmouth, and 18-year-old woman from Totton remain in custody.
The force said officers would remain at the hotel on Wednesday to carry out inquiries.
Hampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service said crews from four stations called to the hotel carried out a full evacuation of the building and "all persons were accounted for".
The fire service said the fire caused extensive smoke damage to the room.
A joint fire and police investigation into the cause is under way.
In a statement, Travelodge thanked the emergency services for their rapid response "and would also like to offer a huge thanks to our guests for their co-operation with the evacuation".
The hotel firm said all guests had been able to return to their rooms and the hotel remained open.
Road closures put in place in the areas surrounding the hotel were lifted at about 02:00, police said.
