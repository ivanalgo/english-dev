Repairs to a 300-year-old bridge will begin in May, East Riding of Yorkshire Council (ERYC) said.
Officials said Â£350,000 will be spent strengthening the single-lane, stone crossing at Stamford Bridge after it was damaged by vehicles.
It will be closed to traffic from 20 May for up to 10 weeks. A diversion will be in place.
Pedestrians and dismounted cyclists are asked to use a nearby footbridge.
A temporary, signed diversion will be put in place for traffic travelling along the Driffield to York route for the duration of the project, the council said.
The Grade II listed structure was built in 1727 and carries the A166 over the River Derwent.
Rows of stone bricks on parapets on both sides of the bridge will be replaced by similar local stone, sourced from Whitby.
Councillor Paul West, the council's cabinet member for environment and transport, said the work would cause "major disruption".
However, he added: "Unfortunately, we don't have any other option but to close the bridge to allow us to carry out this essential work. 
"The bridge is badly in need of repair and strengthening because of the damage that's been caused and we can't leave it any longer."
