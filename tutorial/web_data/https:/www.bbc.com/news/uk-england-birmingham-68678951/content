The owners of Cadbury said its Bournville factory is set to remain the "home and the heart" of the business for many years to come.
Mondeléz International, which owns the chocolate giant, confirmed the news as part of its 200th anniversary celebrations.
Managing director Louise Stigant told the BBC it was a huge privilege to be part of a company with such heritage.
The plant was seen by the firm as the "Crown Jewels", she added.
"I think it's a huge privilege for me and anyone in the business in the UK to be celebrating 200 years, it's such a milestone for the brand and I think something so few brands and businesses have the absolute pride to be able to celebrate," she said.
Cadbury was subject to a hostile takeover by American firm Kraft in 2010 which prompted concern from many quarters, but bosses promised to maintain production at Bournville.
In 2012, it became part of Kraft's confectionery arm, Mondelez International, and Bournville became the firm's Global Centre of Excellence for chocolate research and development.
However three years later, Mondelez announced 200 job losses at Bournville over two years, and some production was moved to Poland.
But Ms Stigant said the company had invested £270m in the UK business since it took it over 14 years ago with Bournville firmly at the centre of plans.
"We see it as one of our Crown Jewels - the Crown Jewel, globally," she said.
"We've invested over £270m in the UK business and that's our objective, that this remains absolutely the home and the heart of Cadbury."
