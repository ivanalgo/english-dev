A nature reserve that is home to the largest grey seal colony in England has welcomed its first pups of the season. 
Blakeney National Nature Reserve, on the north Norfolk coast, is expecting about 4,500 pups to be born before early January.
National Trust ranger Duncan Halpin said the reserve would soon be "carpeted in grey seals". 
The first pup at the reserve was spotted in 1988, but by 2001 there were only 25 births.
The reserve now works all year round to make sure the seals are monitored with low levels of disturbance.
The reserve puts the success of the colony down to it being left undisturbed, an "abundance" of fish for the seals to feed on and a lack of natural predators.
A four-mile (6.5km) shingle spit prevents the seals from being disturbed and volunteers and rangers carried out a beach clean at the start of the season to remove any plastic waste.
Volunteers will use a remote camera to view a continuous live stream of the seal pups to minimise disturbance.
The colony will be also be measured this year using aerial photographs by the University of St Andrews' Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU). 
Mr Halpin said: "The grey seal colony is in the early stages of becoming established for this year and we are looking forward to following the progress of the colony, and its new pups, this winter."
"It's a breath-taking sight and is testimony to the potential of our marine life to thrive when the right conditions, and protection from disturbance, are in place."
