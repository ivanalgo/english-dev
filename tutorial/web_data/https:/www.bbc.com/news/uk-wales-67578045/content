A north Wales holiday park is to close immediately, its owner has announced.
Pontins said its site at Prestatyn, Denbighshire, would shut "with immediate effect".
It also announced that another park at Camber Sands in East Sussex would also close straight away.
On its website Pontins said: "Customers whose bookings will be affected by these closures will be contacted by our team and refunded. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
Record label Tidy Trax had been planning to hold a "wet and wild weekender" at the site and said it was "shocked and concerned" by the news. 
It said on Facebook it was notified by email at 15:00 GMT about the closure.
"Our team is actively working to engage with Pontins to gather more information and clarity on the situation," a spokesman said.
Tidy Trax said it would update its customers within the next 24 hours.
Vale of Clwyd MP James Davies called the closure "unexpected" and said he was asking for further information from owners Britannia Hotels.
He wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: "The site has had a bad reputation for some time and I hope this news brings the potential for welcome change to benefit the town."
The area's Senedd member, Gareth Davies, said the closure was "sad and sudden" in a post on X.
"My thoughts are with the staff, their families and all involved with Pontins Prestatyn at this difficult time," he said.
