The London Eye has been confirmed as a permanent fixture on the capital's South Bank more than 24 years after the first ride took place.
The big wheel was originally granted planning permission with a caveat that meant Lambeth Council had to decide if it could be retained beyond 2028.  
Councillors voted unanimously to keep the attraction, which has about three million visitors yearly.
An official decision notice will be issued next week.
The vote was unanimous, with an ongoing requirement for 1% of turnover to be paid towards the surrounding public area.                                          
Sarina Da Silva and Ibrahim Dogus, councillors for Waterloo and South Bank, said it was "good news for the immediate local area".
They said "London Eye not only dominates the skyline in this part of London, but also sits at the heart of the community we serve and represent". 
"Local businesses value the presence of this major attraction on our doorstep, and there is no doubt that its retention will continue to generate substantial footfall for Waterloo and South Bank."
