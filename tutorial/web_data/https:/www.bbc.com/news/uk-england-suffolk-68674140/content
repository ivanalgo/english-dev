The University of Suffolk (UOS) said it would launch a "cutting-edge" degree in competitive video gaming. 
The Esports undergraduate course, which would explore topics from game design to live streaming, would accept its first students in 2025.
The curriculum was being developed in partnership with professionals in electronic sports.
Professor Stuart Harmer said the course would provide students with "a much-needed pathway" into the industry.
Video-based competitions had seen a surge in players in recent years due to the development of streaming platforms. 
"We are thrilled to announce our plans to create one of the first esports undergraduate courses in the East of England," said Mr Harmer, dean of the School of Technology, Business and Arts at UOS. 
"It recognises the tremendous growth and potential of the esports industry."
The course would look at game design, esports event management, live streaming, esports marketing and analysis of competitive gameplay.
The university committed to invest in a state-of-the-art esports lab that would feature high-spec gaming machines, so the institution can hold its own gaming events and tournaments.
Mr Harmer said: "We have witnessed a significant growth in students studying esports at colleges and schools in the region and by providing this course, we're offering these students a much-needed pathway that allows them an important progression into Higher Education in this industry."
