A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman died at a holiday park.
The woman was discovered with a "significant injury" at Diamond Meadows Lodge Park off Weston Road in Brean at about 16:50 BST on Wednesday. She was declared dead a short time later.
A 70-year-old man was arrested and remains in police custody.
Avon and Somerset Police said formal identification had not taken place but her next of kin have been informed.
Det Insp Neil Meade, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: "Our thoughts are with the woman's family during this time and we would like to reassure them and the local community that our team will carry out a full and thorough investigation to establish the facts. 
"Residents can expect to see an increased police presence in the area over the next few days, but I would like to reassure them that, at this stage, we believe there is no wider risk to the public and this is an isolated incident.
"If anyone has any questions or concerns, we encourage you to speak to any of our uniformed officers or contact your local Neighbourhood Policing Team."
