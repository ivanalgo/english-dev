A huge moorland wildfire in Greater Manchester which crews first extinguished on Sunday has reignited.
The blaze on land near to Buckton Vale initially broke out at 20:19 BST on Sunday but was brought under control in a couple of hours.
However, due to the heat, the fire reignited on Monday morning with about two square kilometres alight between Stalybridge and Dove Stone.
Station manager Lee Bourne said crews are now making "good progress".
He said: "There is a concern about the amount of low lying smoke which is affecting local areas, namely Carrbrook, Greenfield and parts of Saddleworth, along with Stalybridge.
"Due to the weather conditions and there being a lack of wind, the smoke has settled so it is important for residents to keep doors and windows closed where there is any visible smoke."
Crews from across Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Derbyshire spent much of Monday tackling the blaze and the smoke and flames could be seen for miles.
