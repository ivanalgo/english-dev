A man has died and another has been arrested following a lorry crash in Shropshire.  
It happened on the A5 Holyhead Road, between Nesscliffe and Montford Bridge, shortly after 03:00 GMT. 
The deceased, a 23-year-old from Shrewsbury driving the car, was declared dead at the scene.
A 21-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and remained in custody, West Mercia Police said. 
Part of the A5 was closed after the crash. National Highways later said the northbound carriageway, between its junction with the A458 and A483, would remain closed until 19:15 or 19:30.
The closure has also caused long queues on surrounding roads as motorists try to find alternative routes via country lanes. 
The carriageway has now reopened.
The ambulance service said the driver of the car was found in a critical condition by paramedics. 
"Unfortunately, it quickly became apparent that nothing could be done to save him and he was confirmed deceased."
