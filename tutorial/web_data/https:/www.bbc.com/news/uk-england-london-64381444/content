London mayor Sadiq Khan has issued a high air-pollution alert across the capital for Tuesday.
Mr Khan said people needed "to be careful over the next few days" and avoid unnecessary car journeys.
The capital has experienced moderate air pollution since Saturday with the continuing cold, still and foggy conditions resulting in poor dispersion of vehicle emissions.
Messages will be displayed across the Transport for London (TfL) network.
Schools and boroughs will be notified, the mayor's office said.
Mr Khan said he was doing "everything in my power to tackle" toxic air.
"Following the latest forecast from Imperial College London, I am issuing a 'high' air-pollution alert," he explained.
"We all need to be careful over the next few days. I'm urging Londoners to look after each other by choosing to walk, cycle or take public transport where possible, avoiding unnecessary car journeys, stopping engine idling and not burning garden waste, all of which contributes to high levels of pollution. 
"This is particularly important in order to protect those who are more vulnerable to high pollution."
Mr Khan said the alert showed why it was "so vital" to adopt the ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ) London-wide "to reduce toxic air pollution in our city".
Last week he was accused of having provided "false and misleading" information about the widened zone, which comes into force in August. The mayor denied any wrongdoing.
