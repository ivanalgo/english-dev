A charity promoting physical activity has received Â£1.3m to further its work.
Active Oxfordshire will use the funds to expand existing activity provisions, increase active travel opportunities, and launch a programme for infants.
The funds were made available from the Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West Integrated Care Board, Oxfordshire County Council, as well as city and district councils. 
It is expected to go towards more than 16,000 Oxfordshire residents.
CEO Josh Lenthall said the investment was a milestone moment in the charity's efforts to help get people more active. 
He added: "Barriers including cost, access to appropriate equipment and inequality can all restrict a person from leading an active lifestyle. 
"This record level of investment from our local partners means we can begin to remove these barriers by upscaling our existing programmes and introducing new schemes which target future generations.  
"Our research has proven Oxfordshire is particularly vulnerable to significant inequality gaps which, in our view, hold no place in society as it is today. 
"Access to active travel routes, professional guidance from health experts and quality physical activity opportunities should not be a luxury."
Daniel Leveson from the care board said the expansion of services would mean a "brand-new early years physical activity offer, so our county's youngest generation can benefit from an active start in life".
He said the charity would also work with maternity services to increase activity levels in pregnant women. 
Active Oxfordshire said half of the children in the county were meeting recommended activity levels, while more than one in three Year Six pupils are overweight or obese. 
Also, about 10% of children in one of its priority neighbourhoods can swim after leaving primary school, compared to the 80% in the richest areas.
