Four paddling pools which were closed due to a risk of people slipping will be ready for use this summer. 
There was criticism last year after it was decided that the pools would not open.
However, Conwy council said all the pools will reopen this summer following refurbishment. 
The council said it had invested in its four pools at Craig y Don, Llandudno, Rhos on Sea, Penmaenmawr, and Llanfairfechan.
Last April, the council announced it would be not be reopening its paddling pools for the summer due to a "high risk of people slipping".
That decision met heavy criticism, and North Wales Tourism chief executive Jim Jones said it came at a "terrible time."  
It was announced then in May, that the paddling pools would in fact reopen following a public outcry.
Now the authority has announced that plans to open the paddling pools are to go ahead this year. 
An authority spokeswoman said the council was proud of having four of only five remaining free public paddling pools in north Wales and recognised the importance of them to both local people and to tourism.
Councillor Aaron Wynne, Conwy's cabinet member for culture and leisure, said the council was committed to getting the work completed at all sites. 
"Whilst we understand the disappointment caused last year, we are pleased that we have been able to invest to protect the future of all four of our paddling pools and look forward to opening them for the summer season 2024," he said. 
A council spokeswoman added: "We have invested heavily in all of our paddling pools over the past year to ensure their future is secure, and we are grateful for the patience of our communities whilst this essential work has been taking place."
One Llandudno resident, Phil Ashe, questioned whether the opening date was being pushed back, after an earlier statement that they would be "ready as normal".
But the council said it did not provide an exact date for when the pools would reopen.
