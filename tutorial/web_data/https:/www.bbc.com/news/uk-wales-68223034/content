The I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! castle is among the most at-risk historical buildings in Wales.
It is one of 2,708 listed structures, including cottages, tombstones and telephone boxes, on Cadw's new list. 
Gwrych Castle in Abergele, Conwy, which hosted the hit ITV show in 2020 and 2021, is one of 715 in the most at risk section of the list's three categories. 
Cadw had previously refused to publish an at-risk register until a challenge under the Freedom of Information Act.
Last year the preservation trust for Gwrych Castle was given Â£2.2m for repairs because its main 19th Century building was in danger of collapse.
Other buildings at most risk include a fire-damaged pub near Wrexham and the old Navigation Colliery buildings in Crumlin, Caerphilly county.
The three places on the register with most properties at risk are Powys with 101, Gwynedd with 71 and Eryri with 61.
Surveyors have been inspecting more than 10,000 listed structures in Wales over the past year.
