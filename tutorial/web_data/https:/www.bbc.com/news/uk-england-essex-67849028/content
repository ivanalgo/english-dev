Funds are being raised after a religious symbol was vandalised in a town centre.
Around £2,000 has been raised to replace a vandalised Menorah in Epping, Essex.
The multi-branched candelabra of Judaism, placed in the High Street, is used to celebrate Hanukkah, also known as Chanukah.
Rabbi Yossi Posen said the vandalism would not stop them from putting the Menorah up again.
The Menorah has been erected in the High Street for the past four years in December in the lead up to Hanukkah.
The rabbi said it had been "warmly" received by people in the town.
He started the online fundraiser to raise £4,500 and said the response had been "heart-warming".
"The love towards the Jewish community in Epping is so moving," he said.
Rabbi Posen said this was the first time it had been vandalised and the money raised is due to be put towards a new Menorah. 
"We are blessed to live in a country that allows us to practice religion freely and I look forward to a nicer, bigger and brighter Menorah up on the High Street next year to remind us of the message of light, love and hope," he said. 
He said it was not known for sure which day the vandalism took place, but the damage was reported to Essex Police on 23 December.
A force spokesperson said: "Officers attended the scene for initial inquiries with the investigation currently ongoing.  
"If you have any information in relation to the incident, please contact us via 101 or online quoting incident number 1187 of December 23."
