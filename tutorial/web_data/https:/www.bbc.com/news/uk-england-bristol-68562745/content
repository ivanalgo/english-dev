High patient numbers at A&E have pushed health bosses to move to their highest level of escalation - OPEL 4.
NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire (BNSSG) is warning patients to use the correct service for their need as the weekend approaches.
It also asked people to help their loved ones in hospital return home as soon as they are fit for discharge.
Chief medical officer Joanne Medhurst said "well-rehearsed plans" were in place.
"The NHS and local authorities are working together to manage demand and ensure patients continue to receive safe and effective care," BNSSG said in a statement.
The health group said GP practices, minor injuries units, pharmacies and NHS 111 were open and available to help with non-emergency conditions.
Dr Medhurst added: "As we head closer to the Easter bank holiday and school holidays, which is a consistently busy time for NHS services, we're asking the public to help us by using the right services for their needs.
"If you're feeling under the weather or have a minor injury, A&E is not necessarily the place for you.
"In these cases, please contact your GP, visit your minor injury unit or contact NHS 111.
"We're also asking people who have loved ones in hospital to support them to return home as soon as they are fit for discharge. 
"People recover best when they're at home or in a familiar environment and it helps to relieve pressure on our busy hospitals."
