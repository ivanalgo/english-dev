Concerns over coastal erosion in Suffolk and Norfolk are set to be raised at Westminster. 
HM Coastguard said cliffs at Pakefield Holiday Park in Lowestoft, Suffolk, were "extremely dangerous" after a road collapsed last month. 
Several homes were evacuated with people relocated to other areas.
The debate will be led by Waveney MP Peter Aldous, who is calling for more funding to mitigate the impact of high tides.
During a meeting in the Commons last week, Mr Aldous added that both counties had taken "a real battering" in the recent bad weather. 
East Suffolk County Council's deputy leader and Liberal Democrat councillor David Beavan said a further Â£120m was "desperately needed" to fund a tidal barrier in Lowestoft to prevent surge tides flooding the town.
He added: "We are doing all the right things along the coast - rolling back caravans at Pakefield, retreating at Benacre - but Lowestoft can't become a saltmarsh.
"We have diversified from shipbuilding and fishing to an energy coast, but unless we get central funding for our tidal barrier, we will be sunk."
Mr Beavan said a tidal barrier would save 1,500 homes and business from the current rate of coastal erosion in the town, the Local Democracy Reporting Service heard. 
"All the money we're putting into Lowestoft would be wasted if we don't save it. We really want to redevelop the whole waterfront for housing but we can't do that if it's in the sea."
In Norfolk, erosion has also resulted in houses being demolished, with growing concerns over the future of certain towns and villages.
Conservative councillor Noel Galer, who represents Hemsby, said he would be keen on the introduction of a coastal minister.
"I'm very concerned that erosion will affect the economy, the businesses, and ultimately the many people who work in Hemsby," said Mr Galer.
