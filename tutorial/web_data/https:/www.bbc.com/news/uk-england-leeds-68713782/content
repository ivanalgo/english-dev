A new play which explores how the "ripple effect" of knife crime can devastate families is coming to West Yorkshire.
Hebden Bridge Little Theatre's production of The Long Road depicts a bereaved mother meeting the drug addict who killed her teenage son. 
Written by Shelagh Stephenson, the play aims to reflect the issue of knife crime, she said. 
The Long Road will run from 8 to 13 April. 
According to government figures, there were about 50,500 "sharp instrument-related" offences in England and Wales in the year to March 2023. That was 4.7% higher than in 2021/22 but 7% lower than in 2019/20.
The Long Road will show audiences that those "on the wrong end of the blade" are not the only victims. 
The play centres around Mary and her family after her 18-year-old son Dan is stabbed to death. 
She decides to meet the woman who killed Dan, to see if she can find some peace and stop his death from becoming just a "random act of violence". 
Actor Kate Shackleton, who plays Mary, said the role was particularly poignant for her as she has personal experience of the heartache that addiction causes. 
She said: "She is a devoted mother and wife who, despite suffering bereavement and despair, is determined to find a way to navigate her family through the darkness. 
"I am working hard to strike the right balance between severe hurt and bitterness and strength and hope for the future.
"Her complex relationships present a real challenge."    
Director Rachel Doyle-Richards added: "I chose this play because I was really interested in its idea of creating space to listen to those who have caused you harm. 
"No two cases are the same and, whether it be fact or fiction, we tend to be left in no doubt about the ripple effect on family members."
