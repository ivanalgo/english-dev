Police are becoming increasingly concerned for a hillwalker who has been reported missing in a mountain range near Stirling.
Ivan Meyer, 45, left his home in Edinburgh and travelled by train to Crianlarich on Monday.
Mr Meyer is believed to have arrived from the A82, south of the village, to make an ascent on An Caisteal and Beinn a Chroin.
He is about 5ft 11in, of lean build, with dark greying hair and stubble. 
Mr Meyer was last seen wearing hiking clothing, including black trousers, black top, brown hiking boots and a maroon and light blue striped hat.
Officers said he is known to be in possession of a light grey backpack, green one-man tent and two purple hiking poles.
Insp David Marr said: "Ivan has not been in touch with friends or family for the past day and this is extremely out of character for him. 
"As time passes, concern for his welfare continues to grow.
"We are carrying out extensive searches in the area, with the assistance of partner agencies, and are asking for anyone with information on Ivan's whereabouts, or any possible sightings, to please come forward."
