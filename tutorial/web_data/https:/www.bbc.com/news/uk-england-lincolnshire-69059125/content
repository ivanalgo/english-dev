Three men have been arrested after police raided a traveller site in Lincolnshire as part of an investigation into cockfighting.
More than 50 officers carried out warrants at the site in Beckingham, near Newark, on Friday in a joint operation with the RSPCA.
The men, aged 33, 45 and 52, were arrested on suspicion of being involved in, or attending, organised animal fights, Lincolnshire Police said. 
They remain in custody.
A number of items were also seized, including cockerels, dogs, a suspected stolen caravan, two vans and a quad bike.
"The execution of the warrants, which allow for areas of the site to be searched, is part of a wider investigation into the illegal activity of cockerel fighting," a police spokesperson said.
"[It] is a cruel blood sport that in some areas continues almost 200 years after it was made illegal," they added.
According to the RSPCA, cockerels used for fighting are bred specifically for the purpose, and trained using practice birds, with muffs used to cover their sharp claws, or spurs.
Those involved often fight birds to the death and a winning bird can become a "champion" after just a few victories.
