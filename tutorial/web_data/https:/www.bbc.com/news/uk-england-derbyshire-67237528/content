A firework display in Derbyshire has been cancelled due to flooding caused by Storm Babet.
Erewash Borough Council said the event at Long Eaton's West Park had been called off due to safety concerns. 
The authority said it was concerned significant surface water would not clear by 4 November.
Council bosses said further heavy rain on already sodden ground would be a risk to the public and vehicles who need access.
Those who bought online tickets will receive an automatic refund within the next seven days, the council said.
Others who bought tickets from town halls will need to return to the same receptions and hand the tickets back for refunds.
Becca Everett, Erewash Borough Council's deputy leader, said: "It is with great sadness that the council has had to cancel Long Eaton's bonfire and fireworks.
"We know this will come as a huge disappointment to residents in the borough - but safety has to be our number one priority.
"Our focus right now continues to be on helping those living here who were hit by the flooding."
