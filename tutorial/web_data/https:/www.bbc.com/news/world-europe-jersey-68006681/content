The gas supplier for Jersey and Guernsey has announced prices will rise from 31 January.
Islands Energy Group (IEG) said gas tariffs would increase by 8% in Guernsey and by 12% in Jersey.
The changes mean the average household in Guernsey will pay £8.30 more every month, with households in Jersey paying £13.80 more.
IEG's CEO Jo Cox said the company was "fully aware of the challenges households are facing".
The firm plans to review the rises in six months.
Ms Cox said the "difficult decision" was due to changes to costs of importing gas, high interest rates and a "continued volatility" in the market.
She said: "We're confident that our prices truly reflect the cost of gas we supply to our customers.
"We are working closely with both the Government of Jersey and the States of Guernsey to ensure they are fully up to date on the situation and that they are able to offer support where they can."
IEG's tariffs had been kept the same for more than a year.
Ms Cox said the firm offered a Priority Customer Care scheme that offers support to vulnerable customers as well as reviews for customers to see where they can save energy and advice on using smart technology to manage consumption.
She said: "If any customers are struggling with their bills, we would urge them to get in touch with us."
