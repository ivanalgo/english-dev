 A charity walk which raises funds for victims of trauma and abuse has more than doubled its registrations.
Trevi's Warrior Women Walk set off at 10:00 BST on Sunday morning at Burrator Reservoir, Devon.
Participants walked 10km (6.2m) for the Trevi charity based in Plymouth, which provides support for women.
Sarah Dangar, a Trevi trustee, said the walk has "grown massively" since last year.
She said in 2022 there were 250 women taking part, but 2023 has seen about 516. 
Ms Dangar said: "It's a great event bringing women together.
"It's grown massively."
The route follows paths around Burrator reservoir, to Devonport Leat and Sheepstor.
