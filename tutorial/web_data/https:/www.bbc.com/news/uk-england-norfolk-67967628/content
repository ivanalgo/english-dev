A much-admired oak tree has scuppered a developer's plan to build a house.
Plans for a two-storey house in Downham Market, Norfolk, were submitted last year, but neighbours said it would block their view of the tree.
West Norfolk Council refused the London Road application but the developer appealed to the Planning Inspectorate.
After a year-long battle, the inspectorate agreed that building in front of the oak would have an adverse effect, and refused the plea.
Its inspector said: "The oak tree is an attractive specimen and makes a significant and positive contribution to the visual character of the area.
"The new dwelling would become the prominent feature in the street scene… and would, therefore, result in a significant and adverse change to the appearance of the site and the character of the area."
