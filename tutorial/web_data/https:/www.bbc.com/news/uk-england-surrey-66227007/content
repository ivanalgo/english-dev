People visiting Frensham Common in Surrey are being warned to keep out of the pond, after an outbreak of blue-green algae.Waverley Borough Council said pets should also be kept away from Frensham Great Pond.The algae is caused by warm weather and heavy rainfall, and is particularly poisonous for dogs.The Environment Agency said the blue-green algae is in "sufficient abundance to be considered a risk".Contact with the algae can cause eye irritation, rashes, blistering, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea.The Environment Agency said officers collected a sample of suspected algal bloom at Frensham Great Pond bathing water in Surrey on 4 July."Preliminary test results have confirmed that it is a blue-green algae, which can produce toxin (Aphanizomenon), and is in sufficient abundance to be considered a risk," a spokesperson said. "We are advising the local authority and urge members of the public to follow their guidance and keep themselves and their pets away from the pond."The Environment Agency also urged anyone who suspects blue-green algae to contact its 24-hour hotline so they can inform relevant landowners and ask them to take the necessary steps to warn the public of potential dangers.
