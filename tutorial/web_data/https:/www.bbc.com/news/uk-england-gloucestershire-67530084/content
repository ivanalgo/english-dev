A council is urging local businesses to help tackle violence against women and girls.
Stroud Town Council supports the White Ribbon Promise, a public commitment to ending men's violence against women and girls.
The council is holding a drop-in session for businesses with information on how to sign up to the initiative at Thanet House later.
Local football club Forest Green Rovers has already backed the campaign. 
Marcus Reynolds, CEO at Forest Green, said: "As a professional football club we have the opportunity to use our profile and reach as a platform for positive change.
"Calling out unacceptable behaviours and attitudes is a critical step towards preventing violence against women and girls. 
"It's time to change the story and allow women and girls the opportunity to live without the fear of violence."
The White Ribbon promise can be made by anyone over the age of 14, and involves making a pledge to never commit, excuse, or remain silent about violence against women and girls.
"By making the promise, you are taking a crucial first step towards ending this violence," said Stroud mayor Stella Parkes.
"We're thrilled that Forest Green is taking a stand with us and hope that other businesses will join. Together we can make a difference."
The campaign is organised by charity White Ribbon UK which engages men and boys to end violence against women and girls.
