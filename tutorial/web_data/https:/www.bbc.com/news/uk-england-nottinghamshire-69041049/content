A young girl with a rare genetic disorder has overcome a fear of hospitals through the power of play.
Francesca, aged eight, has a condition that affects most of her body and means she spends a lot of time in hospital. 
The trauma of regular visits and procedures led her to becoming "petrified" in healthcare settings, her mum, Kimberley, said.
Francesca overcame her worries with the help of a charity through "play therapy".
Francesca, from Clifton, Nottingham, was diagnosed with Acrodysostosis in 2018 after a GP noticed signs of the genetic disorder. 
"She wasn't particularly meeting her milestones as fast as everybody around her, but we were told she was just small and she'd do it when she does it," said Kimberley.
She recognised her daughter was "petrified" in a healthcare setting and started "resisting normal treatments like blood tests".
She would also have to be sedated to have an MRI.
Francesca's condition affects her hearing, sight, brain, heart and bowels, and requires the expertise of 27 different consultants. 
Her fear of hospitals was eased by charity Starlight, which aims to "transform children's health through play".
A "play therapist" worked closely with Francesca to help ease her worries in hospital and she was eventually able to help her undergo an MRI without having to be sedated. 
Now, with more operations and procedures looming for Francesca, her mum said she and her partner can be reassured that their daughter will feel more at ease in healthcare settings. 
Starlight is now fundraising to be able to provide play equipment such as sensory units and toys in hospitals. 
Cathy Gilman, chief executive of Starlight, said: "Far too many people see play as a 'nice to have' but, we know it can transform a child's treatment journey and improve their mental health."
