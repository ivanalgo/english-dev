A Manx theatre group has performed on board an island-built 19th Century ship in America as part of it's 160th anniversary celebrations.
Cloideryn, also known as the Northern Theatre Group, travelled to San Diego in November to showcase their musical play about the Star of India.
The 205ft (62m) vessel, which circumnavigated the world 21 times, was built in Ramsey in 1863.
Martyn Perkins from the group said it had been a "magnificent" experience.
Originally named the Euterpe, after leaving the Isle of Man it was initially used to ferry cargo and emigrants to New Zealand, before later being converted into a salmon hauler.
The invite to the celebrations followed a visit by a team from the San Diego Maritime Museum, where the ship is on display, to see the original show, which was performed in Ramsey for the first time last year.
Fourteen members of Cloideryn performed excerpts of the musical, which written by Manx residents Heather Ruffino and Marilyn Cannell, on the ship.
The group performed sea shanties on the dockside and at the USS Midway aircraft carrier.
A Manx flag flown over the Tynwald buildings was taken by the group and presented to master of the ship.
A citation from Isle of Man Lieutenant Governor Sir John Lorimer thanking the maritime museum for preserving the vessel was also presented and has now been put on display on the ship. 
Mr Perkins said he felt privileged to attend the commemorations and being given the chance to take the helm for a short period of time was "special".
He said he was "confident" the group's visit, which received local news coverage, would increase visitor numbers to the island as people seek to learn about the ship's origins.
An exhibition, with photos and videos from the group's trip is set to go on display in Ramsey in the near future, he added.
