A prequel to the hit television series Outlander is due to begin filming in Glasgow next month.
A series of roads will close in the city's west end when Blood of My Blood shoots from 7 January.
The time-travelling drama follows the adventures of surgeon Claire and her Highlander husband Jamie Fraser, played by Catriona Balfe and Sam Heughan.
Filming is set to run until 27 January. It is expected to air in 2025 after the final series of Outlander next year.
The series from US network Starz is based on a series of books by American author Diana Gabaldon.
The spin-off will focus on the story of protagonist Jamie's parents - mother Ellen MacKenzie and father Brian Fraser - which means it is unlikely the show's stars Heughan and Balfe will appear.
Glasgow University was previously used as a filming location for Outlander, with streets in the west end doubling for Boston in the 1960s.
Doune, Blackness and Craigmillar castles are among the other Scottish locations in earlier series.
The show is said to be responsible for a boost in tourism numbers at locations across the country as fans retrace their favourite characters' steps.
According to Glasgow City Council a number of vehicle access restrictions will be put in place on roads with terraced houses such as Woodlands Terrace and Park Circus.
Outlander Blood of My Blood  is set to include ten episodes.
