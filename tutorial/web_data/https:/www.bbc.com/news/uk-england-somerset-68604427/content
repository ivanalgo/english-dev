An ex-navy mechanic and his wife feel "honoured" to have won an award from a veterans' mental health charity.
Cris Lovett and his wife Jane, from Weston-super-Mare, have been awarded Regional Fundraiser of the Year 2024 by Combat Stress.
The charity offers treatment to former servicemen and women across the UK with military-related trauma.
Mr Lovett said he had struggled with trauma since his service, but "helping other veterans helps a great deal".
He served in the Royal Navy as a marine engineering mechanic for seven years, but his own post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis came years later after he was attacked during a robbery at work.
The couple first began supporting Combat Stress in 2017, to encourage other veterans who were struggling with their mental health to seek support.
Since then, they have raised awareness of the charity's work and supported it at the National Armed Forces Day last year in Falmouth.Â 
Mrs Lovett has raised funds by taking part in 10k runs and half-marathons, including four in six weeks after the final Covid-19 lockdown.
"We were gobsmacked when we found out we'd won this award," Mr Lovett said.
"It was something we never expected to receive, nor did we start volunteering for this amazing charity to receive awards.
"We will continue to do everything in our power to spread awareness and support veterans in the region who are struggling with their mental health, just like I have," he added.
Robert Marsh, director of fundraising at Combat Stress, said: "We provide the most comprehensive veteran mental health treatment service in the UK, but we couldn't do it without the incredible support and dedication of Cris and Jane and all our other community fundraisers."
