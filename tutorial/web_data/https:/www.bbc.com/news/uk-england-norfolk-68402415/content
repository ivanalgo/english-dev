Walkers have been warned to take care along a stretch of coast after heavy rain caused cliffs to become unstable.
A section of promenade at Overstrand beach in Norfolk was closed at the weekend after sediment slipped from the adjoining cliff.
Elsewhere, a 10ft (3m) section of garden dropped into dunes, with rain believed to be the cause.
"It's important to remain safe when walking near beaches or clifftops," North Norfolk District Council said.
Raymond Cooper, who lives between Winterton-on-Sea and Hemsby, said a section of garden he referred to as "excess land" had dropped away at the weekend.
"It's a complete shock," he said. 
"Only last week I was on that piece of land and it was showing no sign of collapse and it's now gone.
"The rain has soaked the ground and it's slid away; there is no support, so it's just dropped down into the dunes."
Mr Cooper said he was "lucky" his property was not affected by coastal erosion, as it was set well back from the sea, beside Winterton valley.
He said, unlike his neighbours, he had cleared hedges and bushes to give a clear view, and his was the only garden that had slipped. 
The council said there had been a few cliff slips along the coastline, with the cordon expected to be lifted at Overstrand by the end of the week. 
"During periods of prolonged rainfall, water soaks into the soft sediment and impacts the integrity of the cliff," a spokesman added.
"Cliffs will store this water until the internal sediment becomes unstable and a slip can take place hours, days or weeks after the initial rain."
