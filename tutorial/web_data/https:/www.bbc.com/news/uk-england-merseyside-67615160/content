A man who was driving a van at three times the speed limit when he struck a woman walking to work has been jailed.
The 26-year-old was seriously injured when Qureshi hit her on Sandy Road in Seaforth, Sefton, on 9 December 2022, Merseyside Police said. 
Aaron Qureshi, 31, of Waterloo, earlier admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving at Sefton Magistrates Court.
Qureshi was jailed for three years and two months at Liverpool Crown Court.
The force said the woman suffered life-changing injuries when she was struck at about 07:45 GMT.
Det Sgt Kurt Timpson said: "The speed and manner of driving by Qureshi that morning was grossly excessive and inappropriate and has been found in open court to be dangerous. 
"To drive at almost three times the speed limit is a risk no person should ever contemplate. In addition, he drove in icy conditions knowing the risks were high."
He praised onlookers who rushed to help the woman and said their "actions may have saved her life".
Sgt Timpson urged others to reflect on the incident, adding: "Excess speed devastates lives and causes unimaginable harm to people who become involved in road crashes. 
"Not one of us would want to be involved in such incidents and we must change driving behaviour to reduce that harm."
Qureshi was also disqualified from driving for five years and seven months on his release and he would then be required to retake a test before driving again.
