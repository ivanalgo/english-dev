A 31-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a woman was hit by a car and left critically injured in west London.
Met Police were called to Merrick Road in Southall on Thursday just after midnight and found a woman in her 20s who was seriously injured.
Officers said they believed they knew her identity but had not yet managed to find her family.
The man was arrested on Friday and remains in police custody.
Detectives are appealing for witnesses to contact them, especially if they have dash or doorbell camera footage.
