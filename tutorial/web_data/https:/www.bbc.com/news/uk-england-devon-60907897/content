Dozens of firefighters were called to tackle a gorse fire on Dartmoor near Mary Tavy on Monday.
Four hectares of heathland were damaged in a fire front of about 750m (2461ft).
Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said 12 appliances and 60 crew were sent to the scene to prevent the fire reaching the A386.
The fire, which was tackled over about five hours - from 17:00 to 21:45 BST - is believed to have been started by accident.
During the blaze the A386 was closed in both directions from Tavistock to Okehampton.
It comes less than a week after the fire service sent 12 appliances to a gorse fire on Dartmoor.
