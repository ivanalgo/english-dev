Motorists are being asked to drive with extra caution following a rise in crashes involving deer.
Lincolnshire Police said they had received 50 reports of incidents involving the animals in the past month.
Det Con Aaron Flint said lives were being "put at risk", with drivers swerving to avoid them. 
The Lincolnshire Deer Group has put up 'Think Deer' signs in areas with high deer populations.
Mr Flint, the force's wildlife crime officer, said: "It's a bit of a problem at the moment. We have seen a huge increase in the number of deer in recent years in Lincolnshire."
Mr Flint said large fallow deer can cause a "huge amount of damage" to a vehicles and "put people's lives at risk" when swerving to avoid them.
"These deer can burst out in front of you so we need to be really careful when driving around the countryside," he added.
Mr Flint said the force was liaising with agencies such as Defra to find ways to tackle the problem.
The Lincolnshire Deer Group said it had been called out to 194 deer collisions in 2023, up from 140 the previous year.
Lincolnshire Police advised drivers to stay alert, be prepared to stop and check their speed when driving through heavily wooded areas, and to dip full-beams if a deer is spotted as they may freeze.
In the event of hitting a deer, drivers should call police.
