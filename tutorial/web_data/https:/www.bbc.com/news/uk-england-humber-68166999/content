An online exhibition has opened, chronicling people's experiences of the Covid-19 pandemic in East Yorkshire.
Residents shared their observations, including photographs, with East Riding Archives for the project.
Archivist Hannah Stamp said: "Since 2020, we have been collecting the East Riding communities' experiences of the pandemic for permanent preservation."
She said the project highlights the "challenges, resilience, and creativity" seen during the lockdowns.
Ms Stamp said people's stories were told using diaries, photographs and poetry.
Councillor Nick Coultish, East Riding of Yorkshire Council's cabinet member for culture, leisure and tourism, added: "This is a fascinating collection of memories from the pandemic, and really captures a unique time."
