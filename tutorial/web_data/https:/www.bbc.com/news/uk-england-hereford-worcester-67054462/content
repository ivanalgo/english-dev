Plans have been submitted for 90 homes in a Worcestershire village.
Bloor Homes is proposing the development on fields between Worcester Road and Stourport Road, in Great Witley, near Worcester.
The land is included in the  South Worcestershire Development Plan (SWDP), which sets out where thousands of new homes will be built across the region in the next 20 years.
Two previous bids to build 175 homes on the site have been rejected.
The outline plans also include construction of new internal roads, footpaths and cycle links, drainage, areas of open space, landscaping and associated works.  
Plans for the same land and neighbouring fields were turned down twice by members of Malvern Hills District Council in 2016 and 2017.
The second plan, which received more than 100 objections from villagers in Great Witley, was turned down again by a government planning inspector after an appeal was lodged by Worcester-based developer Stennard Harrison's Marsten Developments.
The authority had said the addition of up to 175 homes would "urbanise" the village and harm views from Witley Park and would be "prominent and dominant" against the grade II listed Witley Court.
In June, Lockley Homes asked for 'permission in principle' from the council to build up to nine "custom-build" and carbon-neutral homes off Stourport Road in the village - a short distance from the proposed 90 homes.
Great Witley Parish Council has argued against the plan saying in an objection to the council that the homes were not needed and would obscure views of the Abberley Hills.
