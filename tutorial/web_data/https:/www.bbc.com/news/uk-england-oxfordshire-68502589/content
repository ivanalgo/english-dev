More than £300,000 of extra funding has been given to two swimming pools to make them more energy efficient.
Windrush Leisure Centre, in Witney, and Chipping Norton Lido received the money from Sport England through its Swimming Pool Support Fund.
About £243,000 will go to Windrush to fund the installation of solar panels and more efficient showers.
An additional £84,000 will be used in Chipping Norton to fund a new heat-pump and install solar panels. 
West Oxfordshire District Council applied to Sport England for the funding.
Councillor Tim Sumner, executive member for leisure at the council, said the cost of living crisis had "hit our swimming pools and leisure centres hard" due to rising energy costs, which led to running costs "increasing dramatically over a short space of time". 
He said the proposed changes to both sites would make them more energy efficient, meaning they would not only reduce costs but also carbon emissions.
The council has set a target of 2030 to reach net zero across its estate.
It is estimated the solar panels at Windrush Leisure Centre will provide around 20% of the building's electricity use, while the Air Source Heat Pump at Chipping Norton Lido should cover the heat requirements for the pool for the 130 days it is open during the summer.
Mr Sumner said the council applied for additional funding for all of their swimming pools and leisure centres but "unfortunately" did not get support for any other sites.
