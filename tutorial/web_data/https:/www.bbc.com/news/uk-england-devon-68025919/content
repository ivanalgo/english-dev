Cyclists in a Devon town are being encouraged to get their bikes security marked to prevent theft.
Devon and Cornwall Police said it would be providing the security marking free of charge at South Molton Pannier Market.
The bike marking, which only takes a few minutes, makes bicycles less attractive to thieves because they are harder to sell on.
The event will be held on Thursday between 09:00 and 13:00 GMT.
Sgt Robert Brown, neighbourhood team leader for South Molton, said many children would have received new bikes for Christmas.
"The marking kits mean that bicycles can be traced back to their owner should they be stolen," he said.       
"It is important to think about crime prevention at this time of year, especially as many people, including many children, received new bikes as gifts over the festive period."
