A eight-year-old boy, who was born with one hand, is one of the first children to receive a Spider-Man bionic arm.
Kaden Taylor from Burnham-on-Sea received his 3D-printed Hero Arm as a surprise after mentioning to his family that he would like to wear one. 
Despite being offered prosthetics before, he never agreed to one, until he saw the design by Open Bionics.
"I can cut with a knife and fork now and play tennis. And I can pick up more things," Kaden told BBC Radio Somerset.
Kaden's mum, Colette Taylor, added: "Kaden has never worn any prosthetics, we've always offered him options and he always refused. 
"When I showed him the Hero Arm, he shouted: 'Yes please!'
"It's already made a difference," Ms Taylor added.
"The first thing he wanted to do was go on a walk and hold my hand with it, which is so lovely.
"It's just such a life-changing thing for him to have."
Kaden's family was able to buy the arm due to the community fundraising for him.
Within two months, they raised over Â£13,000.
"It blew up, it was crazy," Ms Taylor said.
"We had people who I've never spoken to before come out and message me."
Kaden added: "Thank you, you're all amazing."
