The hunt for the killer of a 36-year-old man is continuing after police closed off a street in North Ayrshire.
Alan Lawson died in hospital on 6 February, three days after being assaulted in Largs.
Armed officers closed off Canal Street in Saltcoats for a number of hours on Wednesday.
They said they were following a "positive line of inquiry". They previously described the attack as targeted.
Officers were seen entering a property on the street and traffic in the surrounding area was halted, but the incident was stood down at about 16:00.
No arrests were made.
A Police Scotland spokesperson said: "The operation in Canal Street has concluded and inquiries remain ongoing."
