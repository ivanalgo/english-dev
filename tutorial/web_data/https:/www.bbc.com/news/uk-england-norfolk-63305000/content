The first grey seal pup of the season has been born at a nature reserve in Norfolk.
Blakeney Point on the Norfolk coast is home to England's largest colony of grey seals.
The National Trust, which cares for the area, said its rangers expected 4,500 pups to be born this season.
Ranger Duncan Halpin said: "We're really proud to announce the birth of the first pup of the season, it's always a special moment.
"Our job over the coming weeks is to ensure that the seals remain undisturbed so the females can give birth and the pups can feed in peace to maximise the chances of survival. 
"Seals are wild animals and can be dangerous, particularly if they feel threatened. 
"We therefore ask visitors to keep their distance. Bring binoculars to help you see the seals better." 
This season's first pup was born two weeks earlier than last year's.
The very first seal pup was born at the point in 1988 and the area is now home to England's largest grey seal colony, with numbers born increasing from just 25 pups in 2001 to 3,012 in 2019. 
The success was believed to be due to low levels of disturbance and mortality during the first few weeks of life, as well as a lack of natural predators.
