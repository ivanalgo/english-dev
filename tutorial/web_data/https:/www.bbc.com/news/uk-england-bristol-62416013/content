A man has appeared in court charged with the murder of a woman who went missing 10 years ago.
Claire Holland, 32, from the Lawrence Weston area of Bristol, went missing in June 2012 after leaving a pub in the city centre.  
Darren Osment, 40, of Chessel Drive, Patchway, was remanded in custody after an appearance at Bristol Magistrates' Court on Thursday.
He is due to appear at Bristol Crown Court on 5 August.
Mr Osment appeared in front of magistrates in a grey sweatshirt and grey tracksuit bottoms. He spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth. 
District Judge Lynne Matthews said Mr Osment was accused of murdering Ms Holland on a date between June 5 and June 8, 2012.
Members of Ms Holland's family, including her daughter, sister and mother, watched the proceedings from the public gallery, accompanied by detectives from Avon and Somerset Police.
