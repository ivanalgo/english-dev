People with signs of winter vomiting virus have been urged to stay away from hospitals and other health facilities.
The NHS said "very contagious" norovirus was "doing the rounds" in Cornwall and it wanted to prevent it spreading.
"If you have symptoms please stay at home," said Dr Chris Reid, chief medical officer at NHS Cornwall and Isles of Scilly.
Anyone with symptoms due to have a GP appointment should call the surgery.
Some hospital wards have also been affected, so it may not be possible to visit patients, NHS Cornwall said.
People who want to visit should phone the ward before setting out to check the current arrangements.
NHS Cornwall added the best way  to prevent spread is to wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water, and said alcohol hand gels do not kill norovirus.
Although norovirus is unpleasant, for most people it usually passes in a couple of days, the NHS said.
