More community heroes have been celebrated as part of the BBC's Make a Difference Awards.
BBC Essex hosted a ceremony at Hatfield Place in Hatfield Peverel.
A riding instructor who saved her neighbour's life and a father-of-six who locked himself in a cage for charity were among the eight winners.
Maldon's Conservative MP John Whittingdale and Lord-Lieutenant of Essex, Jennifer Tolhurst, were among the guests presenting awards.
Make A Difference was formed out of the first pandemic lockdown and became a virtual notice board for people offering help to those in need.
More than eight million people have interacted with it across all 39 local BBC radio stations.
Essex received hundreds of nominations.
Lou Birt, executive editor at BBC Essex, said: "It was a wonderful night that showed the generosity of Essex people. Every nominee goes the extra mile to help others.
"I'm proud that BBC Essex was doing what local radio does best - being at the heart of the community."
