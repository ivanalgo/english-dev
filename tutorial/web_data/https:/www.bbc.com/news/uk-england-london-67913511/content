A finance and property broker has said he wants to be London's mayor because "the city is broken".
Shyam Batra, 62, who has lived his whole life in Uxbridge, west London, is one of 11 mayoral candidates.
He told the BBC that he did not see himself as a "party political candidate", but rather as someone who "just wants to fix London and give people a voice".
The mayoral elections take place on 2 May.
Speaking about why he has chosen to stand, Mr Batra said he, like many other people he spoke to, "are fed up of everything" and "desperate for change". 
His main priority if elected would be to abolish the Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez) as well as the congestion zone and 20mph speed limits.
"I drive an old car and now when I drive into London I have to pay congestion and Ulez charges. It is a joke. You should not be charged for driving in your own city," he told the BBC.
Other independent candidates as well as the Conservative Party candidate have pledged to scrap the emission zone if elected.
Mr Batra's other priorities include tackling the cost-of-living crisis and improving housing issues by introducing "a finance scheme to get everyone on the property ladder" and to "fix the problems with temporary housing".
Ten other people have been chosen as candidates for the London mayoral elections. They are: 
Mr Batra said he thought people would vote for him as he "can make a change" and was "passionate about making London a better place".
"I know what the general public think and want because I am one of them. I am fed up myself and if I am mayor I won't take any nonsense," he added.
