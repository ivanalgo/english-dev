An MP has called for a Warwickshire hotel to no longer be used as emergency accommodation for asylum seekers.
Nadhim Zahawi, MP for Stratford-on-Avon, wants the Grosvenor Hotel on Warwick Road to be removed from the Home Office scheme.
He has urged immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who told MPs that 50 hotels will close to asylum seekers, to add the Grosvenor to the list.
The government says the cost of housing migrants has risen to Â£8m a day.
It has promised to "reduce" the use of hotels to house migrants while their claims for asylum are processed.
Mr Zahawi said he hoped the Grosvenor Hotel could soon return to normal by re-opening its doors to the public.
"While there was such high demand for hotel accommodation to deal with the migrant crisis, the Grosvenor Hotel was one of those brought in to help deal with the situation," he said. 
"There's still a way to go, but thanks to the efforts of the government to stop small boat crossings in the channel, there isn't such a need for so many rooms going forward."
