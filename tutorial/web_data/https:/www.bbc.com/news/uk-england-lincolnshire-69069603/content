A leading drill star has admitted two drugs charges following a police raid during an online performance.
Digga D - real name Rhys Herbert - appeared at Lincoln Crown Court via video link from HMP Wormwood Scrubs, where he was remanded in custody.
The 23-year-old, of Lonsdale Road, Notting Hill, pleaded guilty to the supply and importation of cannabis.
He was arrested near Lincoln in the early hours of 21 February while broadcasting on Instagram Live.
At the hearing on Tuesday, the prosecution did not accept the basis of his pleas, and Judge Simon Hirst adjourned the case until 8 July to decide if there will be a trial of issue.
The artist pleaded guilty to a charge of smuggling cannabis relating to 11 July 2023. He also admitted supplying cannabis between 26 October 2022 and 21 February 2024.
Digga D is one of the UK drill's leading performers, with his tracks getting millions of views online.
Drill started in Chicago in the early 2010s but in recent years UK artists have adopted the genre.
