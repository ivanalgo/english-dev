Helicopters have been brought in to help firefighters tackle three large wildfires.
Crews are dealing with a large blaze on Maerdy mountain, in Rhondda Cynon Taff, which started on Friday.
A helicopter has been dropping water on the fire, which was still alight on Saturday, South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said.
One is also being used at a wildfire in Cwm Rheidol, Ceredigion, which has been burning on and off since Tuesday.
Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said the fire appeared to have re-ignited on Saturday afternoon, despite being put out at about 05:30 BST on Saturday.
Four fire engines and a helicopter are battling the blaze.
A helicopter is also being used to help firefighters battling a four hectare (9.8 acre) wildfire near the golf club in Penrhys mountain, in Rhondda Cynon Taff, which started at about 16:00 on Saturday.
Kelly George, who lives near Maerdy mountain, said the fire was "burning the side of the mountain all night" and appeared to have gone out on Saturday morning.
"There was a lot of smoke all evening we could smell it all night in bed with the windows closed," she said.
"The helicopter is filling up at Maerdy Reservoir and is back and forth dousing the fire with its big bucket."
But at about 17:00 on Saturday she told BBC Wales the fire appeared to have restarted with the flames spreading quickly across the mountainside. 
Meanwhile, in Maesteg, in Bridgend county, a fire on Garth Hill caused 92 people to call the fire service at about 22:45 on Friday.
The blaze on 15 acres of scrub and gorse, was out by 04:30 the following morning.
And in Talsarnau in Gwynedd, North Wales Police officers are helping firefighters at the scene of a grass fire, which started on Friday. 
A grass fire on Pembrey Mountain in Carmarthenshire, which started on Friday, was also put out overnight.
