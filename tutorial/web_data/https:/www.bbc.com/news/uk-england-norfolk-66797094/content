Police investigating the suspected murder of a woman say provisional post-mortem examination results show she died of gunshot wounds to the torso.
Officers were called to Emneth in west Norfolk on Monday following a report that the body of a woman had been found at a property on Lady's Drove.
Norfolk Police provisionally identified the dead woman as 65-year-old Lesley Page, of the same address.
A man being questioned by police has been released under investigation.
The man, in his 60s, was arrested on suspicion of murder on Monday.
On Wednesday, Norwich Magistrates' Court granted detectives a further 36 hours to question him.
The warrant was due to expire at 03:36 BST on Thursday.
The force's senior investigating officer Alix Wright said: "We are still working to establish the circumstances that led to Mrs Page's death. 
"We are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with this incident, however, we are keeping an open mind and the investigation continues to establish the full facts."
