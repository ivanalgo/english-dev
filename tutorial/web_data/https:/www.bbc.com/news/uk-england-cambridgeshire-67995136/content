A drug dealer caught with weapons and more than Â£2,000 of cocaine in his car has been jailed.
Anton Oakley, 34, of Eastfield Road in Peterborough, was pulled over in an Audi A4 in the city in July last year.
Officers found cocaine, cannabis, a burner phone plus a baton and a knife.
At a trial at Peterborough Crown Court, he was found guilty of possession with intent to supply cocaine and possessing an offensive weapon, and was jailed for three years and nine months.
Oakley had previously admitted several offences including possession of cannabis, driving while disqualified, driving without insurance and failing to provide a specimen of breath for analysis.
He was jailed on Monday, and also disqualified from driving for more than three years, which will start on his release from prison. 
Oakley was told he must also reapply for his licence once his ban has ended.
Det Con Thomas Adams, from Cambridgeshire Police, said: "This was a great spot by our traffic officers who pulled the car over believing it may have been defective and not safe for the roads. 
"Unluckily for Oakley, he was caught red-handed."
