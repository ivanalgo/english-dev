Three groups have announced plans for a public forum to discuss concerns about proposals for a large wind farm on moorland in West Yorkshire.
The Pennine Heritage Trust, Hebden Bridge Literary and Scientific Society and Stop Calderdale Wind Farm have organised the meeting.
Calder Wind Farm Ltd has proposed building turbines on Walshaw Moor, near Hebden Bridge.
No planning application has been submitted yet.
Calder Wind Farm Ltd said the site could be England's biggest if it progressed and would include 65 turbines on 2,300 hectares of moorland.
It has submitted a report to Calderdale Council to help identify the significant likely effects of the project, which would need to be fully assessed as part of a future planning application.
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the groups organising the public forum said it would be a chance to explore the potential impact the scheme might have on the area and environment.
The event on 15 May will include a number of speakers including nature and travel writer and broadcaster Horatio Clare.
Renewable energy investors WWRE, working in conjunction with Calder Wind Farm Ltd, said the plan could generate enough renewable energy to power up to 286,491 homes per year.
It would also plant 300,000 new trees across the Walshaw Moor Estate, include enhanced flood mitigation measures to help reduce the risk of flooding, and stop grouse shooting there.
