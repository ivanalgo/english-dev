A crane has been used to take apart the unauthorised spa building at the home of Captain Sir Tom Moore's daughter.Work first began on Tuesday at Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, to demolish the complex at the family's property.Hannah Ingram-Moore and her husband Colin lost an appeal in October against an order to remove the building, which included a pool, toilets and a kitchen.Ms Ingram-Moore was on site on Friday and watched as the £200,000 development was dismantled.
The building was named after Capt Sir Tom, who raised £38m for the NHS by walking laps of his garden during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. After the army veteran died in February 2021, aged 100, his family set up a separate charity in his honour.Planning permission was initially granted for an L-shaped building in the grounds of the family home which would host memorabilia and celebrate Capt Sir Tom's legacy.Revised proposals for a C-shaped building were then submitted in February 2022 "for private use" - which Central Bedfordshire Council refused.
During the planning hearing in October, representatives for the family said the spa pool would offer "rehabilitation sessions" and the building would enable the public to enjoy the celebrated fundraiser's work.However, planning inspector Diane Fleming said the "scale and massing" of the complex "resulted in harm" to The Old Rectory.Ms Ingram-Moore and her husband asked for 12 months to comply with the demolition notice, but this request was refused.The family had six weeks to apply for a judicial review, but the Planning Inspectorate confirmed that no such application had been received.A deadline of 7 February was set for the demolition of the complex.
The Captain Tom Foundation is under investigation by the Charity Commission, amid concerns his family may have profited from using his name.The foundation said it would "work closely" with the inquiry.During the Planning Inspectorate hearing, family lawyer Scott Stemp said the foundation was "unlikely to exist" in the future.
