An air ambulance service has announced plans to relocate its headquarters.
Hampshire and Isle of Wight Air Ambulance has identified a site near Southampton Airport to set up its new base.
It is currently based across two locations, with operations near Andover, and the charity team in Southampton.
Moving to a more central location would improve response rates and travel time, it said. 
In a statement, it said a new headquarters would "ensure the future" and allow it to "continue our lifesaving work".
The charity said the new base would also present opportunities to create an aftercare facility, where follow-up care for those who previously received emergency treatment could be carried out.
Richard Corbett, CEO of Hampshire and Isle of Wight Air Ambulance, said: "Demand is rising for our vital lifesaving work, but presently, our helicopter is located in the northwest corner of Hampshire, further from the majority of our missions than our preferred site."
Mr Corbett said moving to the George Curl Way site near Southampton Airport would "reduce response and flying times", and "allow us to continue our crucial work for years to come".
He added that the charity wanted to be "good neighbours", and that they were "keen to hear from residents and other important local stakeholders" about their thoughts on the proposed new headquarters.
Before submitting an application to Eastleigh Borough Council, a community consultation will be held at Eastleigh Football Club on Tuesday 5 March from 14:00 to 20:00 GMT, while a virtual consultation will run until Sunday 17 March.
