Architects have unveiled the design of a new bridge connecting a Derbyshire town centre to a nearby park.  
Erewash Borough Council said it intended to replace the current crossing over the canal separating Broad Street and West Park in Long Eaton.
The 110-year-old bridge is so low people using the towpath under it have to duck, the council said.
A higher, wider and curving bridge has now been designed. 
The council said the existing bridge was "unloved" and coming to the end of its lifespan.
A planning application for its replacement has been lodged as part of a wider regeneration scheme alongside the Erewash Canal.
The new crossing will include an area to launch paddle boards and kayaks and its gradient will be less steep making it easier to use, the council said
It will be paid for using some of the Â£25m Town Deal levelling up funding the council has been awarded by the government.
Richard Ledger, from the Long Eaton Town Deal Board, said: "The iconic new bridge should be something that the town can be really proud of. 
"Together with the new waterfront area for West Park the canal will be transformed from being a barrier that splits the town in half to a real asset for Long Eaton."
