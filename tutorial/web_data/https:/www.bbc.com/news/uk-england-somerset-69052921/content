The A431 Kelston Road is being closed for urgent tree felling works for four days.
Bath and North East Somerset Council is working with local land owners to fell 17 trees due to the safety risk branches are posing to road users, a spokesperson said.
A diversion route will be in place for the duration of the closure, which extends between the A431 junctions with Bitton and Penn Hill Road in Bath.
Work will be between the 28-31 May.
Councillor Manda Rigby, cabinet member for transport, said the felling is being carried out during the school half term to "take advantage of reduced traffic... and minimise disruption to motorists".
"Unfortunately, these works will coincide with Wessex Water works on the A4 in Saltford so we are advising motorists to plan their journeys ahead of time.
"We apologise for the inconvenience and short notice but hope people will understand that the issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible."
There may be some disruption to access for residents, as narrower sections of the highway are put in place.
There will be signage in advance of the closure to warn motorists with access to the diversion route viewable on one.network.
