The National Trust for Scotland has been gifted £2.4m after impressing a mystery donor with its restoration work at Barry Mill in Angus.
The trust said it was one of the largest sums it had received from a donor since it was founded in 1931.
Barry Mill is one of only a small number of water-powered mills left in the country.
The trust said the mill's restoration was "well under way" and it will reopen to the public on 21 March.
Historical records show that there has been a mill on the site since at least 1539.
It was rebuilt after a fire about 1814 and was the last water-powered mill to have worked in Angus.
Barry Mill ceased milling oatmeal and animal feeds in 1982. 
The anonymous donor visited the mill earlier this year and was impressed by the work already carried out, and the knowledge of the team behind the restoration.
The trust's chief executive Philip Long said the donation was a "wonderful, generous gift." 
He said: "It is especially heartening that it was the powerful combination of our special places and people which inspired this substantial signal of support."
The conservation charity has enjoyed a record year for donations, with more than £10.8m raised so far in 2023.
