A lorry carrying poultry overturned blocking a roundabout in Shropshire for several hours.
The A5 Chirk bypass was closed at the Gledrid roundabout between the B5070 Chirk Road and the A483 Halton roundabout, north of Oswestry.
Congestion was reported to be back to the Gobowen turn off. 
Road diversions were put in place after the crash, which happened at about 03:30 BST, with damage to the road surface and a fuel spill. 
The A5 reopened at about 13:30 after what National Highways described as a "complex recovery operation".
