A disused police station put up for sale with a Â£1m price tag last year could be converted into a gym.
Plans have been lodged with Thurrock Council to turn the building in South Ockendon, Essex, into a gym and therapy centre.
The two-storey building would have changing rooms, studios, lounge spaces and a reception area. 
An outbuilding on the site would be redeveloped into a physio and treatment room under the plans.
The police station was built in the 1950s and closed in 2016 as part of an ongoing review of the force's assets.
It stayed empty for seven years before being put on the market last year.
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the proposed AB Salute gym would have 28 parking spaces with two bays including EV charging facilities.
It would be likely to open from 06:00 to 22:00 with the busiest hours expected to be from 16:00 to 20:00.
If approved, the gym would have nine staff with five on site at any one time.
A report to planning officers by the applicant said: "The site is located within a very sustainable location with easy access obtained via active travel modes and public transport.
"The nearby residential properties are likely to form a majority of the new client base, although as a conservative estimate it is assumed that 35% of future members will live locally and therefore don't need to rely on a car."
It added: "The proposed development is compliant with local policies and supports national planning policy to focus commercial development where this is needed and desired."
It is not known when a decision will be made on the plan.
