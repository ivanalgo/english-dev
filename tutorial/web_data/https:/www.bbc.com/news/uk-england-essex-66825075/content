A boy who taught himself to crochet during lockdown before selling his creations to raise thousands for charity was among the community heroes honoured at a special awards evening.
Stanley was won of eight winners at the BBC Essex Make a Difference Awards.
Thirty two finalists were at the ceremony at Hatfield Place in Hatfield Peverel on Thursday.
BBC Essex executive editor Shahid Hussain said it was an "honour" hearing some of their stories.
"Creating a unique moment and championing the achievements of our winners and finalists was an absolute pleasure for the team at BBC Essex," he said.
"The stories and experiences we've heard at our awards ceremony shows us how fortunate we are to have so many wonderful people making a difference in the lives of others."
Make a Difference was formed during the pandemic and it became a virtual notice board for people needing support.
Millions have interacted with it across all 39 local BBC radio stations and hundreds were nominated for the Essex awards.
