A sink hole which opened up in a Lincolnshire village road swallowed the tyres of a passing lorry.
The tipper truck's wheels dropped through the surface at the junction of Salem Street and High Street, Gosberton, at 09:50 GMT on Thursday.
The road has been closed while emergency repairs are carried out, Lincolnshire County Council said.
A drain cover has also been affected with Anglian Water being notified about the issue, the council added.
A lane closure on High Street affected bus services with some being cancelled, operator Brylaine Travel said. 
The lorry has been recovered "but the hole remains", Lincolnshire Police said.
