A decision is due to be taken on whether to continue with plans to build a swimming pool on a site where medieval remains were found.
The remains were discovered at Abbey Fields, in Kenilworth.
Councillors meet on Thursday to decide whether to go ahead with the pool project, due to rising costs and delays.
Warwick District Council Leader Ian Davison said a difficult but clear choice must be made.
Ceramics and at least five buildings, some dating back to the 13th Century, were found at Abbey Fields.
The discovery was made by a firm demolishing the previous pool as it carried out investigations of the site with Archaeology Warwickshire.
Plans for the new multi-million pound swimming centre were changed to protect the remains.
They include raising the building's foundations by 50cm.
The total project was set to cost £14.7m but that could increase to £22.6m, said the council in a report in September.
"Councillors have a difficult, but clear choice to make as to whether we go ahead with this project or not," said council leader Ian Davison.
"Should they agree to continue, they must decide the maximum price the council is prepared to pay and close monitoring will be needed to ensure that this is not exceeded."
