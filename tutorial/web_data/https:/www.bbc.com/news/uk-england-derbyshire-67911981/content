Traders in Derby city centre have said a busy Christmas has boosted their businesses.
The city's Cathedral Quarter Business Improvement District (BID), said some shops reported sales 4.5% higher in the weeks up to Christmas than in 2022. 
The BID ran a series of events in late November and December to try to attract people to the city.
However one trader told BBC Radio Derby that while he thought there were more shoppers, they were buying less.
Sarah Mortimer, owner of Milk and Honey in Sadler Gate, said her sales figures for December were 18% up on the year before.
James Hurdis, director of fashion shop Canopy, in Sadler Gate, said: "The four or five weeks leading up to Christmas were busy. It gives you a sense of hope and makes you feel a bit more positive about the city centre in general."
Jason Marshall, of Foulds Guitars in the Strand Arcade, said: "It has been busy [over Christmas] and footfall was higher - but people were spending less.
"When people are coming in, they buy a guitar but not necessarily any accessories. They are being more focused in their purchasing."
The BID said sales figures from a number of selected shops were up by an average of 4.5% in the last five weeks of 2023, compared to 2022. 
BID bosses said attractions such as giant snow globes, the city centre ice rink, and a Nordic bar in Market Place had helped attract thousands of people to Derby.
