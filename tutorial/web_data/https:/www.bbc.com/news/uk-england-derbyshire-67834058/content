Police investigating a crash that killed a mother and her son have traced the driver of a car they wanted to speak to as a witness.
Angela Boyack died at the scene of the crash in Span Carr in Derbyshire, while her son Stephen Boyack died later in hospital.
Police previously appealed to find the driver of a blue Jaguar estate who was in the area at the time.
They said they had now located the driver and spoken to them.
A force statement said: "We've spoken to the driver and a number of other witnesses as part of the ongoing investigation."
Another driver, Joshua Hill, previously appeared in court accused of the following charges:
Mr Hill was arrested on 11 December, two days after the crash.
The 27-year-old, of Wheata Road, Sheffield, appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on 12 December and was remanded in custody to a future date.
Ms Boyack, who was 59, and her son, who was 22, were travelling in a Hyundai when it collided with a black BMW on 9 December.
The crash happened at about 10:20 GMT on the A632 Chesterfield Road.
