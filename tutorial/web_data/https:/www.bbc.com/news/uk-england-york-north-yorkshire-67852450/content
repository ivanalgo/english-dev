A York tourist attraction has been forced to close this weekend due to flooding, management said.
The York Dungeon was closed on Saturday and Sunday after river water entered part of the building.
General manager Mark Mattinson said the clean-up was under way and the attraction is expected to reopen on Monday.
Eight flood warnings remained in place across the county.
Speaking to BBC Radio York, Mr Mattinson said the closure comes at what should be "a really busy time" for the attraction.
"At this time of the year, people are all Christmas'ed out so we're a nice alternative to that," he said. 
Mr Mattinson said the city was no stranger to flooding, with many businesses - including The York Dungeon - implementing flood protection measures after the devastating flood of December 2015.
The York Dungeon last flooded in February 2022, although Mr Mattinson said that on that occasion it was less severe.
Describing some of the anti-flood measures installed, Mr Mattison said: "All the electrics are now at waist height up to head height. It's concrete floors, so it's just a case now of getting the clean-up done." 
Mr Mattinson said people with bookings would be offered a guided walking tour instead.
Meanwhile, the Environment Agency said levels on the River Derwent at Buttercrambe Mill are still very high after Storm Gerrit. 
There are also concerns about rising water levels at Weir Caravan Park at Stamford Bridge and at Kexby Bridge. 
The River Ouse has a number of warnings - as does the River Wharfe at Ryther.
Cattal Bridge and Cawood Bridge are all still closed due to flooding. Thornton Bridge near Helperby has recently reopened and is now passable with care.
