A military museum is appealing a wider range of D-Day stories and childhood memories from 1944.
The Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum (SOFO) in Woodstock will commemorate the 80th Anniversary of D-Day by expanding its permanent displays.
A special exhibition is aiming to tell the stories of Oxfordshire people about the build-up, D-Day invasion, and Normandy campaign that followed.
The new display will open from 18 May to 24 September.
Museum visitors can already sit inside a recreated section of an Airspeed Horsa Glider, the type used to carry men of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry to Normandy.
Audio headsets allow them to hear Major John Howard recount his memories of the historic Pegasus Bridge operation.
Chairman David Shouesmith explained that the anniversary "is an opportunity to restate and refresh" some of those "compelling" stories.
He added there would be "many other less dramatic stories" that they were keen to bring to light, "and which may resonate with wider audiences", such as meeting Allied soldiers.
In addition to the anniversary exhibition, other stories and perspectives will be explored, such as the contribution of many RAF stations and other sites across Oxfordshire.
A new online talk will also be streamed on 22 May at 19:00 GMT, titled The Pegasus Story: In Their Own Words, which will make use of recorded interviews from veterans of the Pegasus Bridge operation.
The museum will also host Ingram Murray, formerly an officer in the Royal Engineers and Parachute Regiments for a talk on the Sappers in the Gliders on 30 May 2024.
D-Day stories can be submitted to the museum via its website, over the phone or by email.
