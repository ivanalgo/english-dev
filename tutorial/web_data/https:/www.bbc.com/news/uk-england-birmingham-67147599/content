An archery club has been set up in a bid to get more Muslim women to take part in the sport.
Crescent Archers, based in Birmingham, is attracting beginners of all ages. 
The news comes as a report published this year by the Muslimah Sports Association (MSA), found 97% of women surveyed wanted more involvement in sport and 37% were not involved in any.
Jamila Bi, who set up Crescent a year ago, said there had been a "phenomenal" response to it.
"It has been really, really positive," she said.
"We have had women, who are in their 60s, take part, which is absolutely fantastic.
"We have seen bonds form between relations, father and son, mother and daughter and it has become a really family-orientated sport.
"It is good for not only their physical but their mental wellbeing as well, it has improved their concentration levels, it has brought self-esteem, it has brought confidence up."
Fazeelat Sharif wanted a way to spend time with her daughter - and archery has done the trick.
"She actually liked it and then I got involved and then we started to compete with each other and just have fun," she said.
The group has been supported by Archery GB and the Commonwealth Games Legacy programme, as well as local team Andalus Archers. 
Andalus and the Crescent club came together for a session to raise money to support people affected by the Moroccan earthquake, in September.
Riaz Mohammed, from Andalus, said they provide kit for people to take part and qualified coaches to help people develop.
"It doesn't matter if you're young or old, if you're strong or not, whether you are abled or disabled, it is a sport everyone can participate in," he said.
"That has shone out by the numbers of people attending and the diversity of people attending as well."
