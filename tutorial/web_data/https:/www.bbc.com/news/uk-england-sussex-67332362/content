The first steps for a new cross-county tourism body have been given the green light by a county council leader. 
On Friday, East Sussex County Council (ESCC) leader Keith Glazier signed off "in-principle" proposals to establish Experience Sussex.
The new body is set to be run as a partnership between ESCC and West Sussex County Council (WSCC) with ESCC financial support.
Mr Glazier said: "If we pull this off, the benefit... must be enormous."
In the same meeting, he also gave his backing to the formation of a new Sussex Local Visitor Economy Partnership (LVEP). 
This new body - set to consist of ESCC, WSCC and Brighton and Hove City Council (BHCC) - would have a similar but separate role to the UK's Local Enterprise Partnerships.
It would be responsible for organising area-wide tourism planning and marketing. 
In a report to Mr Glazier, officers said the body was intended to help Sussex as a whole realise its "unmet growth potential" in tourism. 
A focus on this area could result in a Â£2.5bn economic impact and an additional 35,000 jobs, it said.
Experience Sussex was not intended to replace existing tourism bodies, but instead to amplify their messages, the council was told.
James Harris, head of economic development, said: "When we look to go to the Lake District, we go to Visit Lake District. Its an epicentre and hub through which everything else links. 
"This is our kind of equivalent, the gateway through to Sussex.  All of those constituent brands - which are really important - will all be given that extra platform," he said.
