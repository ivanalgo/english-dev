Changes to dog rules on beaches across east Devon have come into force.
East Devon District Council (EDDC) said some beaches now allowed dogs to be off a lead throughout the year but restrictions have been introduced on others.
Jacobs Ladder beach, Beer beach and Seaton beach walkway are some of the spots affected.
The fine for breaching dog rules has also increased to Â£100, the council said.
The major changes include: 
Councillor Geoff Jung, EDDC's portfolio holder for coast, country and environment, said the rules were reviewed every three years.
He reminded dog owners to clean up after their pets in public places.
"Please remember not everyone loves dogs," he said.
