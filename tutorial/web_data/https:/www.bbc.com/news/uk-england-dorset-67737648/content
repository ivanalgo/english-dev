Road closed signs prompted by the partial collapse of a town centre building are damaging Christmas trade, businesses have warned. 
An emergency closure was put in place in Broad Street in Lyme Regis following the partial collapse on 8 November.
Ward councillor Belinda Bawden said the signs had "deterred day visitors and Christmas shoppers alike". 
Dorset Council said it would review the signage, in co-operation with roads authorities in Devon.
Road closure signs were put in place at the Lyme Regis turn-off on the A35, diverting traffic towards Axminster in order to access the town and causing a seven-mile detour.
Ms Bawden called for measures, including extra days of free parking, to be introduced to help traders in the town.
She told a meeting of Dorset Council many were "genuinely worried" and deciding not to take on the extra staff they usually do at this time of year because of a drop in takings.
"A disappointing trading year thanks to a wet August and successive road closures from early September is now exacerbated by the emergency road closure on 8 November at the bottom of Broad Street," she said.
She added road closed signs as far away as Beer across the border in Devon were dissuading people from travelling into Lyme Regis.
Highways portfolio holder Ray Bryan said that while residents and businesses had his utmost sympathy, the best he could do was ask for the signs to be reviewed in conjunction with highways teams in Devon to strengthen the message that town centre businesses and car parks were open as usual.
He said a consultation on to how to "encourage economic growth, healthier environments, and active travel" in the long-term would begin in January.
