The death of a British former paratrooper in Ukraine is being treated as homicide by local authorities, police have said.
Daniel Burke, of Wythenshawe, Manchester, was reported missing on 16 August after he had travelled to the front line in 2022.
A body was later found and police said the Ukrainian authorities have now confirmed his death after DNA tests.
He was found in Zaporizhzhia, about 44km (27 miles) from the fighting.
The BBC spoke to Mr Burke just over a week before his death when he expressed intentions to join a Ukrainian army unit to fight against Russian forces.  
He had been delivering aid in the country after taking a break from the front line.
Greater Manchester Police said the Ukrainians are "treating his death as a homicide" and its Serious Crime Division is assisting the investigation.
Det Supt Lewis Hughes said: "This is a tragic case and we do not underestimate the impact it has had on Daniel's family who have been left devastated by his loss.
"These are difficult circumstances and GMP is continuing to work with the family and the Ukrainian authorities to re-patriate Daniel and bring him home."
Before fighting in Ukraine, Mr Burke joined the Kurdish YPG militia to fight the Islamic State group in Syria following the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017.
In 2019 he spent eight months in prison accused of terrorism offences over his actions, before all charges were dropped in 2020.
He had previously served in the Parachute Regiment between 2007 and 2009.
