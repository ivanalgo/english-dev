An ex-police officer who made indecent images of children has been given a suspended jail sentence.
Aidan McKay was based in Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire before stepping down from the force after his arrest in March.
The 28-year-old, of Bedford Avenue, Wyton, admitted three counts of making indecent images of children and possessing extreme pornography.
He was given a 16-month term, suspended for two years, at Luton Crown Court.
McKay was also handed a Sexual Harm Prevention Order and put on the Sex Offenders' Register for 10 years.
He resigned from his post in August and a misconduct case will be held next year now the court proceedings have finished, Cambridgeshire Constabulary said.
Deputy Chief Constable Jane Gyford said: "We expect our officers and staff to uphold the highest standards of behaviour at all times. 
"We continue to ensure everything is done in the public interest when someone breaches those expectations and continue to invest heavily in developing our unique culture in Cambridgeshire Constabulary.
"Aidan McKay's actions have undermined the very essence of UK policing's core values in protecting the public, especially children."
