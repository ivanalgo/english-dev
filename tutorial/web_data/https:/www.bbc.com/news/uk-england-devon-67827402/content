A Devon council plans to remove flowerbeds from a seafront esplanade to build a new bus stop in their place.
The existing bus stops on Seaton's Marine Place and Seafront Gardens would be replaced by a single stop, Devon County Council said.
The new waiting area is proposed for the esplanade side of the roundabout.
The council said it "appreciated" losing the flowerbeds might be "disappointing" for residents and visitors.
But it added: "It is agreed that pedestrian safety must come first, and it is essential that these beds are removed for this work to go ahead
"The removal of the flowerbeds does though offer an opportunity for East Devon District Council to consider how to make the best use of the space to make the seafront a more attractive place to visit."
If the proposal proceeds, funding would come from the Department for Transport, it said, with plans now on the council website.
The council said it aimed to complete works by spring.
