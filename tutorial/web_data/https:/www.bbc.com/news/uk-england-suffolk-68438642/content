A mum whose daughter has uncombable hair syndrome wants to teach her that "different is beautiful".
Layla, three, from Great Blakenham, Suffolk, was diagnosed with the condition that affects only about 100 people, when she was about one. 
Mum Charlotte, said her hair is constantly "fluffy" as it lacks protein and grows in a different shape and "outwardly".
"We don't treat her any differently but the rest of the world does", she added.
Charlotte said the biggest challenge for her family is to explain "consent" to Layla.  
"People just come up and touch of her," she added. 
"How do you teach a child it's not OK to go up and touch someone?"
Charlotte said when several people noticed Layla's hair was different, and after her third or fourth nail infection, she went for tests. 
She said testing was not available on the NHS so went to a private trichologist - a hair and scalp specialist -in Ipswich who was "thrilled as it was the first case he'd seen".
"I was stunned, we always knew she was special but now she's diagnosed as special," Charlotte said. 
Charlotte said the family wanted "to teach her that being different is beautiful" so created an Instagram account to "educate people".
"There's not too much she can do about her hair and I want her to love it and I want her to know people love it too."
She said when she recently went to a supermarket a man aggressively said to her "why would you style your child's hair like that, it looks like you've rubbed balloons all over her".
Charlotte said she thought carefully how to respond, as it would show Layla how to handle it. 
"I said, I haven't done anything to her hair, it's natural and I think it's beautiful."
