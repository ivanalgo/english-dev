More than 400 men came together to "sing their hearts out" at a concert to support charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Peterborough Sings! and Peterborough Male Voice Choir mentored and supported four partner choirs who sang at the event in Nottingham on Saturday.
It marked the end of a national singing project called Men United in Song, funded by Arts Council England. 
Preparation took place over 10 weeks, with more than Â£90,000 and counting raised for the charity.
Male voice choirs from Northampton, Worcester, Radcliffe-on-Trent and Welwyn Garden City all performed at Nottingham's Albert Hall.
Peterborough Male Voice Choir have run Men United in Song since 2014 to show the "joys and benefits" of group singing and to raise money.
Will Prideaux, director of Peterborough Sings! and the Men United in Song project, said: "It's not about finding the next Gary Barlow or Alfie Boe, but about giving ordinary men the opportunity to come along, try something new and enjoy the challenge and teamwork of singing together.
"Everyone's in the same boat, and it's all about the experience and the journey."
Laura Kerby, chief executive at Prostate Cancer UK, added: "It's incredible that so many men came together to sing their hearts out in Nottingham, particularly when they had little or no experience of singing before their 10-week rehearsal period."
