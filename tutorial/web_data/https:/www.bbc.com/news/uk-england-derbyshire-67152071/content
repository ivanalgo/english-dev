Plans to build 41 new homes in a Derby suburb have been submitted.
Developer Urban Investments Nottingham has applied to build on green land in the Chellaston and Shelton Lock area next to Sinfin Moor Lane.
If the plans are approved, a mixture of two, three and four-bedroom homes will be built along with a number of two-bed flats. 
Derby City Council will now consider the application, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
