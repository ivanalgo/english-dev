A church is facing a "real headache" to fund repairs after thieves stole lead from its roof.
The vestry at All Saints' Church in Westbury, Wiltshire, was badly flooded in July 2023 following the theft and many items had to be thrown away.
The church has been granted permission to replace the roof with steel but Reverend Rebecca Harris said they are struggling to meet the £25,000 bill.
The ministry team is hoping the community will help contribute.
Rev Harris said: "It is a great sadness to us that we have not been able to open the church every day since the theft. 
"The last few months have been very difficult with the extra work and disruption that the theft has caused."
The theft from the Grade l listed building was reported to police but the culprits have not been found.
In addition to replacing the vestry roof, there are added costs of repairing the internal damage that the flooding caused to floors, ceilings and doors.
The church said that due to increasing cases of lead thefts, insurers had not paid out the full cost of repairs, which has left the congregation with a financial shortfall of about £18,000
The church has applied for grants but said these are not guaranteed and take time to be processed, so the congregation has asked local people to support them with donations.
Churchwarden Ruth Hann said: "The congregation of All Saints' Church does not receive any funds from the Church of England or the government for maintenance of the church building, so having to find the extra money to fund these repairs is a real headache for us."
Rev Harris added: "We know many people appreciate the ability to call into the church for a quiet moment, to say a prayer or just explore its beauty and discover the story of the people of Westbury through its monuments and windows."
