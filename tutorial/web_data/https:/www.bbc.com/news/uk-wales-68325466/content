Fire Brigades Union members passed a motion of no confidence in the man charged with leading culture change. 
Stuart Millington was made interim Chief Fire Officer of South Wales Fire and Rescue Service to change the misogynistic culture.
However, union members say they were concerned he was given the role despite being reported for bullying, harassment and discrimination. 
The Welsh government did not wish to comment on the no-confidence motion.
South Wales Fire and Rescue Service has been asked to comment.
Allegations of sexism and abusive behaviour towards staff prompted an independent investigation of South Wales Fire and Rescue Service (SWF&RS).
It followed an ITV news report in 2022 claiming firefighters had kept their jobs despite allegations they had sexually harassed and abused women in the service.
The report found "the existence of a sexist and misogynist culture in many places in the service".
The chief fire officer Huw Jakeway apologised and stepped down, with Mr Millington given the task to change culture.
On Friday, the South Wales Brigade Committee of the Fire Brigades Union passed a motion of no confidence in the appointment, saying concerns raised about his behaviour were ignored.
The union said its members felt "let down" by the appointment and believe it has "significantly eroded public trust and unfairly detracts from firefighters' commitment to sustainable cultural change". 
It wants Mr Millington's appointment to be reviewed. 
The union's regional secretary Duncan Stewart-Ball said the "overwhelming majority vote proves how strong a feeling members" have. 
"The cultural review into south Wales showed that employees were not listened to and this is exactly what is happening now," he said. 
"The lack of accountability and transparency is truly shocking."
