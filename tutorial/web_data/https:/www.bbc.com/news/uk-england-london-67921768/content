A man who is charged with murdering a man who died six years after a stabbing attack has appeared in court.
Tyrese Osei-Kofi, 24, from East Dulwich in south-east London, is accused over the death of Jamel Boyce, who was stabbed outside a Sainsbury's in Clapham, south London, in October 2016.
He suffered a cardiac arrest, causing brain damage, the Old Bailey heard.
Mr Boyce, who was left blind, paralysed and unable to speak, died in a care home aged 22 in February 2022.
A post-mortem examination found the cause of death was a penetrating injury to the chest.
Appearing from custody in a grey prison uniform, Mr Osei-Kofi did not enter a plea during the brief hearing.
Judge Richard Marks KC remanded him in custody until a plea hearing at the same court on 26 March.
A provisional trial date was fixed for 28 October.
