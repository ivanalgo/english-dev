A cycling duo have created a 248-mile (400km) route to "showcase the best of Suffolk".
Developed by husband and wife Chris Bower and Sharon Calton, from Bury St Edmunds, the new Wolf Way takes riders on a loop of the county.
Cyclists will pass historic landmarks, such as Bures Dragon and Languard Fort in Felixstowe.
Mr Bower said they wanted to encourage people "to explore and learn more about the fantastic Suffolk countryside."
Named after the legendary Wolf of St Edmund, the varied route takes in existing bridleways, cycle paths, gravel tracks and byways.
Ms Calton said: "We'd already ridden several times around East Anglia in various forms - off road, on roads.
"When Rebellion Way was launched around Norfolk, we thought 'well we've got a similar route around Suffolk.'"
The ride will provide opportunities for cyclists to connect with Suffolk folklore, including the mythical wolf in Bury St Edmunds and the Couples' Curse at Goldbrook Bridge in Hoxne.
Ms Calton, who works as a cycling coach, continued: "[There are] so many parts of Suffolk that people don't even know are there on their doorstep, which we want to highlight."
The pair have suggested eateries and accommodation stops along the way for those who want to spend three to five days completing the full loop, which has now been recognised by Cycling UK.
Mr Bower continued: "We're really trying to build that link between local businesses... we get cycle-friendly destinations along the route and they get some more customers."
They have also developed shorter "family friendly" routes within Wolf Way and a mini Wolf Cub loop - a 60-mile (100km) route which can be completed in a day.
