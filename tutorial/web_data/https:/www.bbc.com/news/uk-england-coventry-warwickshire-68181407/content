The opening of a B&M store in a city centre has created 35 jobs, a council says.
The firm took over the former Wilko shop in Cathedral Lanes Shopping Centre, Coventry, which closed in October.
The discount retailer agreed to buy up to 51 of Wilko's 400 stores after the brand fell into administration.
Coventry Foodbank was nominated to unveil the new shop on Friday by the firm's staff.
They were selected due to the work the charity did for the community, the city council said.
