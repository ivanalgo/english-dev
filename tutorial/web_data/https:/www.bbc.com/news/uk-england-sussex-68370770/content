Dame Judi Dench and Sir Lenny Henry are to appear at one of the UK's longest-running literature festivals. 
They have been announced to speak at the 35th Charleston Festival alongside Joanna Lumley, Gilbert & George, David Nicholls and Nicola Sturgeon.
The festival takes place between 16 and 27 May in the grounds of the house and gardens in Firle, East Sussex.
 A spokesperson said it was "one of its most ambitious line-ups yet", bringing together "today's leading voices".
One highlight is set to be Dame Judi Dench looking back on an extraordinary career with her close friend, collaborator and fellow actor, Bill Nighy. 
The letters exchanged between the writer Virginia Woolf and her brother-in-law, the art critic Clive Bell, will be brought to life by acclaimed British actor Toby Jones. 
Helena Bonham Carter will read extracts from historian David Kynaston's forthcoming book A Northern Wind: 1962-1965.
Melissa Perkins, from Charleston Festival, said: "Our programme this year is brimming with trailblazing talent and must-see moments that make this anniversary edition unmissable."
