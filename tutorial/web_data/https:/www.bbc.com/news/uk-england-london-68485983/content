An 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was fatally assaulted in west London.
The suspect was detained in Derbyshire after the death in hospital of a man, 43, from injuries he sustained in Dawley Avenue, Uxbridge.
Met Police and the London Ambulance Service crews were called to the scene after the attack on Monday. 
The victim's family has been informed but formal identification has yet to take place.
The teenage suspect is in custody and will be transferred to a police station in London, the Met said.
A post-mortem examination is due to be held later this week.
