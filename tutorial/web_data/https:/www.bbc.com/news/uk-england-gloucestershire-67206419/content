Ponds at a beauty spot are set to remain in place after a study showed restoring the site's original watercourse could increase flood risk.
Forestry England is holding a consultation on the future of Cannop Ponds after issues were found with its 200-year-old dams.
It has now ruled out "re-naturalising" the area and will consider other options.
A petition against draining the ponds has been signed by 45,000 people.
Forestry England says the dams at the Forest of Dean beauty spot require substantial engineering work due to potential flood risk to nearby properties and has been looking at options to solve the issue.
Last July, it was revealed that the dams may not cope with severe weather, as they do not meet modern engineering standards.
Forestry England has published the results from two studies which look at the four proposed options to restore the dams and the potential impacts on biodiversity and flood risk.
It said the re-naturalisation of Cannop Brook, which involved restoring the original watercourse, similar to how it would have been before the construction of the reservoirs, is no longer viable due to a potential increase in flood risk.
Other options, including storm water storage through the removal of the upper reservoir spillway and the creation of a cascade of ponds through the removal of both spillways, are now being considered.
Josh Howe, Forestry England director of engineering, said the results of the studies will play an important role in the decision-making process.
"We are facing a changing climate and a biodiversity crisis and so delivering a project that will mitigate against future flood risk whilst supporting habitats and species is vital," he said.
"Both these factors are crucial, and we need to strike a careful balance between them."
The land managing agency hopes to confirm a preferred option in early 2024.
