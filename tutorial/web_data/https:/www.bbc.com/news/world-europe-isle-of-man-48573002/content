A man has died in a crash involving two motorcycles.
The collision happened at about 11:20 BST in Ballakillowey Road in Colby, Isle of Man.
One of the bikers - a 57-year-old man from Ireland - was pronounced dead at the scene, Insp Juan Kinley of the Isle of Man Constabulary said.
No-one else was injured in the crash and the road between the Ballakillowey roundabout and the Ballakilpheric junction has been closed.

It is the second death of a motorcyclist in the Colby area within a week, following a crash involving three motorbikes in Sloc Road on Thursday.
