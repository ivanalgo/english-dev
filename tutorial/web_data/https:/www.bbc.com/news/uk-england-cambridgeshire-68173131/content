A detective has been fired for sexually harassing three female colleagues. 
Cambridgeshire Constabulary's Det Sgt Mike Barnshaw had "manipulative and controlling" relationships and "harassed" the women when they ended.
A disciplinary panel found he had breached standards of professional behaviour and he was dismissed without notice following a two-week hearing.
Cambridgeshire's Deputy Chief Constable Jane Gyford said his behaviour was "deplorable".
The force said the former officer, who was based at Parkside Police Station in Cambridge, was in sexual relationships with three women between 2015 and 2021. 
He was "manipulative, abusive and controlling" with two women and "manipulative and controlling" with the other. 
When the relationships ended, he behaved in a manner deemed by the women "to be harassing" towards them and continued "unwanted" contact.
Ms Gyford said: "This was an extremely distressing case for the women involved and they've shown incredible fortitude and courage in supporting the misconduct proceedings."
She said Det Sgt Barnshaw behaved in a "deplorable" manner, carrying out "intentional and repeated" acts.
She said his actions "threatened to discredit the police service and undermine the public's trust that the vast majority of officers work extremely hard to build".
The hearing heard the officer "abused his position in that he used his rank and/or the imbalance of power to start and/or maintain close and/or emotional and/or sexual relationships with female colleagues".
His behaviour abused his authority and created an "intimidating hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment". 
The sexual relationships created a "clear power imbalance", the hearing was told.
