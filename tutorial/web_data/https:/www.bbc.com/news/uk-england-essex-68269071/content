A man has been charged with murder after a woman in her 60s died in Essex.
Police officers were called to Dorset Avenue, Great Baddow, at about 14:30 GMT on Friday after reports of a "suspicious male".
They then found a seriously injured woman at a nearby address in Readers Court. She died at the scene.
Sebastian Compton, 47, of Readers Court, has been charged with the woman's murder and is due at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Monday.
He was remanded in custody ahead of the hearing, Essex Police said.
Det Ch Supt Rob Kirby appealed for anyone with information to contact officers.
"I'd like to reassure those living in the Great Baddow area that there is no wider threat to the community," he added.
