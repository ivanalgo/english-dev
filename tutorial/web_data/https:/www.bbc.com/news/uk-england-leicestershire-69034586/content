A woman who started sharing books with a few boxes on a table has now turned her garage into a community library.
Lisa Batty started leaving books outside her Rutland home during lockdown and now has about 1,000 for people to borrow or swap for free.
The 47-year-old said she wanted to share her love of books and raise money for a local charity from donations.
The garage library in Tyne Road, Oakham, is open every second Sunday of the month.
Ms Batty said she has always loved books and reading and wanted to share her passion with the community during the Covid pandemic.
"We only intended to have a few boxes of books out on a table for free for people, but we got too many donations so we opened up the garage," she said.
The book lover has moved her household items to the back of the garage and filled the front with bookshelves. 
She said she was also utilising a ladder as a bookshelf.
"We invite people to leave books they don't want anymore and don't know where to pass it onto," she said.
"Everyone is welcome. You don't have to bring a book, just come, have a browse and take a book to read.
"The garage now gives people the space and the opportunity to share and browse all the books. 
"It's great to pass on books and new stories to people." 
Tracey Canham, who uses the service, said it was a "marvellous idea because it brings books to people".
"During Covid, these little boxes were left out and I'd pick a few and put a few in," the 50-year-old said.
"Now it's grown a lot. I love the fact it's easy to get to and there's lots to choose from.
"It's brilliant because other people get to read what I've read and enjoy them again and again."
Ms Batty added people can make a donation to borrow the books, which would go towards the Oakham Canal Green Corridor Project.
