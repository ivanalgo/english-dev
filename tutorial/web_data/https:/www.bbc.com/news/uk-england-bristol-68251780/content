Three more people have been questioned by police in connection to alleged fraud at a waste company.
Avon & Somerset Constabulary confirmed two men and a woman were voluntarily interviewed in the investigation into council-owned Bristol Waste.
Staff working for the company are alleged to have taken payments to mis-report the amount of waste that was being brought in.
A total of five people have now been questioned.
In September, a man in his 40s and another in his 30s were also interviewed voluntarily.
A police spokesperson: "We can confirm there's an ongoing investigation into alleged fraud at a waste depot in Avonmouth.
"Five people have voluntarily attended for interview as part of our ongoing enquiries.
"Bristol Waste continues to assist with our investigation."
The firm previously said it took immediate action to tighten up security at the depot after the allegations came to light in 2020 and that it handed over all potential evidence to police.
When the investigation was revealed last year, Bristol City Council deputy mayor Craig Cheney said the local authority was assisting with enquiries and that it expected the company to "continue to remain vigilant and take immediate action where necessary" against suspected fraudulent activity.
