A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman's body was found in Northampton.
Her body was discovered in Rhymer House in Chalcombe Avenue, Northampton, at 20:40 GMT on Saturday 17 February.
Police said the woman, who is thought to have been in her 30s, had not been formally identified but a post mortem examination had taken place on Sunday.
The 45-year-old Northampton man was arrested on Saturday and remains in police custody.
Paramedics from the East Midlands Ambulance Service first reported the "unexplained death" in the Kingsthorpe area of Northampton.
Police are guarding the building and expect to remain there for the next few days while an investigation takes place into the circumstances of the death.
The senior investigating officer, Det Insp Simon Barnes, said: "This is a tragic incident in which a woman has sadly lost her life, and our thoughts are firmly with her family and friends at this time.
"We know incidents of this nature can be a cause of concern within the wider community, however while I would like to reassure members of the public that we are confident this is an isolated incident.
"There will continue to be a police presence in the area over the next few days, and we would encourage anyone who has any information that they believe is relevant to this investigation to please get in touch," he added.
