Blur will play the first gig at Wolverhampton's revamped Civic, which is reopening after eight years and a £48m transformation. 
The Britpop legends will perform on 26 May as part of the band's warm-up shows for Wembley Stadium dates in July. 
The Grade II-listed venues, which include Wulfrun Hall, will be known as The Halls and have undergone major construction work.
They will be operated by AEG Presents as part of a 25-year deal.
It is estimated the complex will boost the economy by more than £10m per year and is expected to attract about 300,000 visitors a year.
Other acts already announced to play the venue in coming months include Sparks, Suede, McFly and Japanese fusion band Babymetal. 
"With an opening line up that was already massive having Blur play the first show is incredible," said Steve Homer, head of AEG Presents UK.  
"The band specifically wanted to play the venue as they share a long history together - what better way to open the venue with them? It's going to be an amazing show and I can't think of a better way for The Halls to return."
The 85-year-old iconic venue, which has hosted artists including The Clash, David Bowie, Nirvana and Morrissey, closed in December 2015 for the renovation works which were delayed when serious issues came to light.
The completion date was further put back by the Covid-19 pandemic, the city council has previously said. 
Improvements include upgraded seats, a greater number of bars as well as revamped toilets, and lift access to the new balcony level.
Blur's other warm up shows include a home-coming gig in Colchester and Eastbourne Winter Gardens.
