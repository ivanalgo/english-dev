Work is under way to double the capacity at a power station in North Lincolnshire.
Energy provider Centrica said it was installing four ultra-efficient hydrogen-ready engines at its peaking plant in Brigg.
The move would allow it to meet demand at times when renewable generation was low, the company said.
Once connected, the engines would have the capacity to power 20,000 homes for a full day, a spokesperson added.
According to Centrica, the expanded power plant would form part of a trial due to start in late 2024 to blend hydrogen into the gas.
Work is expected to last around nine months, with the plant being fully operational by early 2025.
Peaking plants generate electricity only when there is high or peak demand, or when generation from renewables is too low.
Chris O'Shea, group chief executive of Centrica, said: "While the UK has made amazing progress towards a renewable energy future, gas plays an essential role in ensuring homes and businesses have access to a reliable electricity supply when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine.
"So, we're delighted to be expanding the Brigg energy park to help balance the increasing renewables on the grid."
