A former British gymnast has set a dizzying world record performing 36 handsprings in less than 30 seconds.
Lucie Colebeck, who performs with Cirque du Soleil, set the record at the Royal Albert Hall where the world-renowned circus show is in residency.
Ms Colebeck, from Binfield in Berkshire, trained at Pinewood Gymnastics Club in Wokingham.
She won world and European medals during her tumbling career before retiring from the sport in 2018. 
The powertrack performer smashed the Guinness World Record for the most back handsprings on a trampoline in 30 seconds (female), by completing 36 rotations, beating the previous record of 25.
She said: "It feels absolutely amazing to have broken this record. We do it in Alegr√≠a, however in the show we only do five in a row, so to be able to attempt to do as many as possible in 30 seconds is quite a difficult thing to do."
Lucie, who has been performing with Cirque du Soleil since 2018, added: "Even though it's really quick it almost goes a bit slow motion so there are moments when I do feel like I'm flying."
Contortionist Oyun-Erdene Senge also broke a world record, performing the most contortion roll push ups in 30 seconds (female), beating the previous record of 21 with her total of 24.
She supported her weight on the palm of her hands and performed as many push ups as she could in the allotted time.
Adjudicator Megan said: "I knew the cast of Cirque du Soleil were good, but seeing these record attempts in person and up close was something else. 
"I was amazed by the level of flexibility and upper body strength shown by Oyun-Erdene and Lucie's attempt was lightning fast as she managed to beat the record with at least five seconds to spare."
