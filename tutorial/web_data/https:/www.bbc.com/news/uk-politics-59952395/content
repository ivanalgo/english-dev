Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to be questioned by MPs over allegations he may have misled Parliament about Covid rule-breaking parties - claims he denies. 
Investigations carried out by senior civil servant Sue Gray and the Metropolitan Police last year found rules had been broken and a number of fines were issued, including to Mr Johnson and his then chancellor, Rishi Sunak. 
A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said "those people were at work talking about work".
The rules:
Legal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse. Government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising.
This event was not investigated by the police.
About 100 people were invited by email to "socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening". Witnesses told the BBC the prime minister and his wife were among about 30 people who attended.
Mr Johnson apologised to MPs for attending the event, saying he spent 25 minutes thanking staff, before returning to his office.

According to a report in the Daily Telegraph, the gathering in the flat where Mr Johnson and his wife lived was to celebrate the departure of Dominic Cummings, the PM's former senior adviser. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place.
The rules:
Eight days earlier Mr Johnson had announced a new lockdown in England. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes.

Downing Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street on this date.
However, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister's then press secretary Allegra Stratton joking about reports of the event, saying: "This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced." 
Ms Stratton resigned following an angry backlash, saying she would "regret the remarks for the rest of my days".

One of the events was a leaving party for the PM's then director of communications James Slack, who apologised for the event and acknowledged it "should not have happened at the time that it did". 
Downing Street also apologised to Buckingham Palace for the two parties.
Mr Johnson was not at either party.
The rules:
The rules had been eased in England on 12 April, but working from home continued to be recommended and socialising indoors with people from other households was not allowed. Meeting others outdoors was limited to groups of six people or two households.
The police investigation determined that an event on this date did breach the rules in place at the time but they did not confirm whether it was one or both of the events.
We know fines were issued to some people who attended Mr Slack's leaving party, but we do not know the identities of all the people they were issued to.
