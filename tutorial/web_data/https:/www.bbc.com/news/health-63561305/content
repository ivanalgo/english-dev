The government has reached a pay settlement with a million health workers after a majority of unions representing NHS staff backed the deal.
Under the deal, which was first proposed in March, staff will get a 5% pay rise plus a one-off sum of at least £1,655.
But the Royal College of Nursing and two other unions have threatened more strikes.

Nurses
For the first time, the 24-hour walkout from 20:00 BST on 30 April to 20:00 on 1 May involved NHS nurses across all departments. 
However every hospital was guaranteed a minimum level of cover for intensive care and trauma as the RCN has to abide by trade union rules to ensure life-preserving care can be provided during a walkout.
In the past, NHS advice has been to dial 999 in an emergency and attend hospital appointments on strike days unless told otherwise.
Ambulance staff
The advice remains to call 999 in an emergency.
Those who fall, or suffer other non-life-threatening injuries, are unlikely to receive 999 care. 
Junior doctors 
More than 196,000 hospital appointments had to be cancelled because of the strike in April.
The previous strike in March disrupted more than 175,000 appointments and procedures.
NHS advice was to dial 999 in an emergency and attend hospital appointments on strike days unless told otherwise.
Junior doctors
The starting salary for a junior doctor in England is £29,000. After finishing their second year of training they earn more than £40,000 on average.
Doctors at this level earned about £14,000 in extra payments - for things like unsociable hours - in the year to September 2022, according to NHS Digital.
By the end of their training, which can last 15 years for some, basic pay is more than £53,000.
Nurses
The starting salary for a nurse is England is just over £27,000 a year. 
A nurse with four years' experience could expect to earn close to £33,000. On average, nurses took home £4,200 in extra payments in the year to September 2022. 
The most senior nurse consultants can earn up to nearly £55,000. 
Ambulance workers
Ambulance workers include paramedics, emergency medical technicians, care assistants and call handlers. 
The different roles straddle a number of pay scales, and staff can also receive additional payments for overtime and shift working. 
For example, paramedics in England typically start on Band 5, earning from £27,055 in 2022/2023.
After two years they can move to Band 6, which starts at £33,706.
According to the Nuffield Trust's analysis of NHS digital figures, the average NHS salary of a paramedic in England in the year to March 2022 (including those working part-time) was £46,643.  That includes £13,854 from extra payments. 
Emergency medical technicians typically start at Band 4, earning from £23,949. 
Physios
Starting salaries for physios are just above £27,000 in England. 
The most experienced can earn more than twice that in the NHS. Many combine NHS and private work.
In the year to September 2022, physios received nearly £3,000 in extra payments.
Correction 2 May: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described emergency medical technicians as "support staff". This has been corrected and salary details updated.
