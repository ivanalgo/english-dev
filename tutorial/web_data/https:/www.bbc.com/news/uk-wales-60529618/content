A tractor driver was trapped in floods for more than 10 hours after the River Severn burst its banks. 
David Jones got stuck in the water on his way to a quarry near Llandrinio, Powys, as he drove to pick up stone. 
The 64-year-old had no option but to sit tight in the remote lane as his mobile battery was flat. 
The drama unfolded at 07:30 GMT on Tuesday, and colleagues raised the alarm at 15:40 when Mr Jones had not returned.
After Dyfed-Powys Police were contacted Mid and West Wales Fire Service and the National Police Air Service were called in to help.
"I was going to the quarry to get some stone," Mr Jones, from Acton Burnell, Shropshire, said.
"I was going through the water and it started getting deeper and deeper, so I had to stop or the water could have damaged the engine."
The banks had burst in the wake of storms Eunice and Franklin.
"I just had to wait for someone to come looking for me," he said.
"I didn't turn the radio on because I was worried about the electrics.
"I had my lunch with me so I was okay for food.
"Everyone did an excellent job to find me, it was a big relief to see the helicopter."
Mr Jones said police found a social media post that showed a tractor in the distance.
Officers then used a website called "what3words" to pinpoint his location.
They were then able to able to guide a helicopter to Mr Jones.
Insp Darren Brown said: "There had been no contact throughout the day, so we didn't know if he was safe.
"We called in NPAS to get as close to tractor as possible to look inside. They saw a reflective jacket and movement, so confirmed somebody was inside."
The fire service then used a boat to rescue Mr Jones.
