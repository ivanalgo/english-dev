A public consultation ends later on plans for a new stadium for rugby club Wasps and thousands of homes on green belt land in Kent.
Sevenoaks District Council (SDC) has asked for feedback on the proposals, which are part of its new local plan.
Residents were asked their views on 2,500 new houses at Pedham Place close to Swanley, and a nearby rugby stadium with more than 20,000 seats.
The plans prompted opposition, and some criticism of the consultation.
Su Hewitt, campaign leader for No Pedham New Town, said it was "unfair" the consultation period began in the run up to Christmas. 
She said: "It has been difficult to reach everyone and people went away during this time and are busy with all sorts of family and social events, let alone work demands that pick up at a year end. 
"We have asked Sevenoaks District Council for more time but we haven't heard anything." 
A council spokesman said they had extended the consultation period from six to seven weeks.
Councillor Simon Reay, from Sevenoaks District Council, said: "The sites under consideration have been put forward by landowners in the most suitable and sustainable locations, those that are close to existing settlements with transport and services. 
"After the consultation closes, and we have considered all of the comments, we will publish a revised version of the local plan during the summer when our communities will have another opportunity to comment on the proposals."
SDC's local plan will see the building of 10,000 new homes over the next 15 years,
The public consultation ends at midnight on Thursday.
