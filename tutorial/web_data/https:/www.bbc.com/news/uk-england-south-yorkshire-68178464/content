A man has been arrested after the death of a 75-year-old pedestrian who was hit by two cars near Doncaster, police have said.
The elderly man was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash in Greens Way, Mexborough at 18:10 GMT on Thursday.
Police said he had been struck by a Peugeot Bipper Tepee and a Ford Fiesta. 
The 23-year-old Fiesta driver left the scene, but was later arrested on suspicion of driving while unfit through drink or drugs. 
He was also being held on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care and attention and failing to stop, police said.
The driver of the Peugeot remained at the scene to help officers with their investigation. 
The victim's family had been informed and were being supported, police said. Anyone with information is urged to contact officers.
The A6023 was also closed for investigations but reopened in the early hours of Friday, police added.
