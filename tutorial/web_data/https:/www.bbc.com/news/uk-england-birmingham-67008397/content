Two people have been taken to hospital after a car hit a woman before smashing into the front of a Poundland store.
The male driver is believed to have had a medical episode before the crash on High Street, in Longbridge, West Midlands, at about 11:40 BST.
The pedestrian suffered non-serious injuries and was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, along with the driver, the ambulance service said.
Poundland said the store was closed after the "distressing event". 
West Midlands Fire Service said it received a number of calls about a collision on High Street and crews discovered a car had hit a shop front.
"Our crews cordoned off the area and liaised with our specialist technical rescue teams to ensure the structural integrity of the building," a spokesperson said.
"Having inspected and assured the structure of the building and found it to pose no further risk to the public, our crews left the scene with our colleagues from West Midlands Ambulance Service and West Midlands Police."
Poundland thanked the "prompt attendance" of emergency crews adding that they wished those involved a speedy recovery.
"We're not aware of any serious injuries to customers or colleagues, but this was an unexpected and distressing event for all those involved," a spokesperson said.
"It goes without saying we're offering every support to our colleagues in the store."
