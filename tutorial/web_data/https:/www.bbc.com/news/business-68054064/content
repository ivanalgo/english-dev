Train drivers' union Aslef has called off five consecutive days of strikes on LNER services that were set to begin next month.
The action affecting LNER, which operates on the East Coast Mainline, was scheduled to start on 5 February.
However, walkouts by train drivers for many rail operators will still take place between 30 January and 5 February in a row over pay and conditions.
LNER drivers will join in one day of strikes during that period.
A source told the BBC that Aslef had called off the extra five days of action because LNER had told the union that it no longer intended to put minimum service levels (MSLs) in place.
LNER had planned to implement the measure on 2 February, during a period of widespread strike action that will affect 16 train operators. 
Under new laws, employers can require staff who are planning to walkout to provide 40% of timetabled rail services.
On Thursday last week, Rail Minister Huw Merriman said the government hoped the minimum service levels would be implemented, but it was "a matter for the employers".
A spokesperson for LNER, said: "We welcome news that the threat of extended disruption to our services has been lifted.
"We encourage Aslef to work with us to find a way to end this long running dispute which only damages the rail industry."
Rolling strikes that will affect different operators each day are still due to start on 30 January.
However, as things stand, it appears that none of the train operating companies will seek to impose minimum service levels.
The strikes will affect the following companies based in England:
Union members will also refuse to work overtime from Monday 29 January until Tuesday 6 February.
ScotRail and Transport for Wales are not included in the dispute.
