Community champions who go above and beyond in Cambridgeshire have been honoured in the BBC's Make a Difference Awards.
BBC Radio Cambridgeshire hosted the event at Peterborough Cathedral.
It celebrated local people for their achievements and contributions to their communities.
More than eight million people have interacted with the Make a Difference campaign across all 39 local BBC radio stations to date.
The public nominated people earlier this year for the eight categories, ranging from being a great neighbour to helping the environment.
David Harvey, executive editor at BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, said the awards were an opportunity to thank people in communities who "make life better for others".
"It is our privilege to recognise the efforts of those who have made a difference both at the ceremony and across the output of BBC Radio Cambridgeshire," he said.
The winners include a range of people who have contributed to their local communities, from providing hot meals for Peterborough's homeless to helping improve relationships between the police and young people.
