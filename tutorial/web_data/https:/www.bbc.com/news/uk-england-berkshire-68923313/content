A council leader has quit to focus on trying to win a seat at the next general election.
Lee Dillon became leader of West Berkshire Council in May 2023 when the Liberal Democrats took control of the authority.
He took a sabbatical from the role in January but remained on the council's executive. He has now fully quit.
Mr Dillon, a councillor for Thatcham North East, will stand against Tory MP Laura Farris in Newbury. 
The authority's deputy leader, Jeff Brooks, has been the council's acting leader since the start of the year.
