Demolition work has begun on an unauthorised spa building at the home of Captain Sir Tom Moore's daughter.Hannah Ingram-Moore and her husband Colin lost an appeal in October against an order to remove the structure in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire.Revised proposals for the building were submitted in February 2022 which Central Bedfordshire Council refused.The spa itself was removed by crane from the building on Friday.
Neighbour Jilly Bozdogan said she was "pleased" that it was "going to come down".She said: "I don't think it should ever have been put up in the first place. "Being neighbours they could have come and talked to us. I just think it's common courtesy."
The building was named after Capt Sir Tom, who raised Â£38m for the NHS by walking laps of his garden during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. After the army veteran died in February 2021, aged 100, his family set up a separate charity in his honour.Initially planning permission was approved for a building within the grounds of the family home to host memorabilia and celebrate Capt Sir Tom's legacy.Updated proposals submitted for the already partly constructed building included a spa pool, toilets and a kitchen, which a document called the design and access and heritage statement said was "for private use".
During the planning hearing in October, representatives for the family said the spa pool would offer "rehabilitation sessions" and the building would enable the public to enjoy the celebrated fundraiser's work.However, planning inspector Diane Fleming said the "scale and massing" of the complex "resulted in harm" to The Old Rectory.A deadline of 7 February was set for the demolition of the complex.
