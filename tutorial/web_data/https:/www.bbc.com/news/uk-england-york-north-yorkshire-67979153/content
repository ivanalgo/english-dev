A man was hit over the head and suffered a suspected eye socket fracture in an attack in a North Yorkshire village, police have said.
The victim was struck in Acaster Malbis on 5 January at about 20:00 GMT. Police appealed to trace a man they want to speak to about the incident.
Officers said the man, who they have not named, has links to Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Leeds.
They also asked for information about a car seen in the area at the time.
The dark-coloured hatchback is believed to have stopped on Airfield Lane at the time of the attack, which happened between the industrial estate and Acaster Selby.
Officers said they would like to speak to motorists who were travelling along the road, which runs alongside the old airfield, between 19:45 GMT and 21:00 GMT.
