A pilot managed to land his plane safely after a section of his wing fell off during an aerobatic flight.
The incident happed over a disused airfield near Tempsford in Bedfordshire 
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the right aileron - the trailing edge of a wing which controls movement - came off when the pilot performed a roll.
The AAIB said a hinge failed due to fatigue cracks and recommended regular inspections of similar parts.
The pilot took off from Little Gransden Airfield, Cambridgeshire on 1 May 2021.
The 45-year-old man planned to undertake a 30-minute aerobatic flight, including two display routines in the Edge 540 aircraft.
He then initiated a roll to the left but almost immediately heard a loud bang.
The pilot saw that the right aileron had detached from the outer and central hinge and was concerned the remaining aileron might jam.
He mentally rehearsed his abandonment drill in case he lost control of the aircraft, the AAIB report said.
But the pilot still had sufficient control to make a safe landing and taxi back to the hanger.
The AAIB said the aircraft manufacturer had issued a service letter to all known owners recommending regular detailed inspections of similar aileron centre hinge attachments.
The UK Light Aircraft Association has contacted all affected owners to ensure they are aware of the service letter.
