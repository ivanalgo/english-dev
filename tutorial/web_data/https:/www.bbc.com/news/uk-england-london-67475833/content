A woman is in a critical condition after she was attacked by a dog at a property in south-east London.
The Met Police, ambulance and air ambulance were called at about 09:00 GMT to Bedwell Road, Belvedere, to reports of an attack.
The woman was taken to hospital along with a man, who escaped with minor injuries.
The force said the dog, an Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog, died after it was injured during the incident.
"The dog received injuries during the attack and Taser was discharged by officers who secured it in a separate room. It has since died," the force said.
London Ambulance Service said the pair were taken to a "major trauma centre as a priority".
