Motorists have been warned of "inevitable disruption" as major work to upgrade a roundabout takes place.
Lincolnshire County Council said the scheme would reduce congestion on the A16/B1180 Pinchbeck roundabout.
Work was due to start on Monday and was expected to take up to 10 months to complete, officials said.
Richard Davies, executive member for highways, said the aim was to "keep people moving" and ensure access to nearby businesses was maintained.
"Not only will we be making the roundabout bigger, with the junction widened to provide two wider lanes within the roundabout, but we'll also be lengthening the two-lane approaches and exits on the A16 North," he added.
"And, while the road is dug up, we'll also be taking the opportunity to install a new drainage system ahead of laying new road surfacing and installing new signage and street lighting columns."
The project is being funded by a portion of a £20m levelling-up fund.
Other projects include improvements to Spalding's A16/A151 Springfield roundabout, the A16 Marsh Lane roundabout, and active travel improvements in Boston and Spalding.
Mr Davies said: "It's important to note these works will be running concurrently with our ongoing works down the road at the Springfield roundabout," Mr Davies said.
"As with any major road improvement project, some disruption on local roads is inevitable when work is under way."
Temporary traffic signals or night-time closures would be required to remove the traffic islands at the roundabout, according to Lincolnshire County Council.
