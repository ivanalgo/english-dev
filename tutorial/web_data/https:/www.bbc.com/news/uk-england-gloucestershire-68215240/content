Gold-mounted false teeth worn by Sir Winston Churchill have been sold at auction in Cheltenham for £18,000.
The upper dentures were worn by the wartime leader during many of his most famous speeches, including the "We shall fight on the beaches" address.
They were specifically made to preserve his natural lisp and so important he carried two sets with him at all times.
The Cotswold Auction Company said the teeth were "snapped up" for more than double the £8,000 guide price.
The wartime premier, who was born at Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire, suffered from dental problems most of his life and lost several teeth during his 20s.
The false teeth, thought to be one of three or four identical sets, were made for Churchill when he was 65 at the beginning of World War Two.
The winning bid of £23,184, including premium, was from a UK collector bidding online.
Director of the auction house Liz Poole said the teeth were "among the most unusual items" they had ever sold.
"We were absolutely delighted with the international interest in the sale of Churchill's false teeth and other memorabilia, which included phone bids from collectors in the United States and UK," she said.
"The story generated global media coverage and featured in the news as far away as Canada, the US and Poland.
"The buyer has snapped up a unique piece of our country's history."
Other lots included a microphone reputedly used by Churchill on VE Day to announce the end of World War Two, which sold for £11,500, plus buyer's premium.
