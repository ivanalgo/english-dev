A nursing home in Glasgow is to close after moves were made to remove its licence for failing to improve how it looked after residents.
The Care Inspectorate had identified "serious and significant concerns" about the quality of care at Rowandale Nursing Home in Pollokshields.
The home was issued with a warning following unannounced inspections in July and August.
However, a follow-up visit showed none of the required improvements were made.
A spokesman for the Care Inspectorate said: "We understand this is a difficult and distressing time for residents, their loved ones and staff at the home.  
"However, our first priority is always the health, safety and wellbeing of residents."
The Care Inspectorate had flagged up issues including "safe and effective management, leadership and oversight of the care home and improved working practices and care of people in the home".
The spokesman added: "We have submitted an application to the sheriff court seeking cancellation of the care home's registration.
"This could allow new care arrangements to be put in place for residents of the home.  
"We are working closely with partners including Glasgow Health and Social Care Partnership and the Scottish government to ensure that residents experience appropriate care that meets their needs during this difficult time."
Rowandale's deputy manager Kenneth Macmillan said the home would now close after becoming "unsustainable" during the Covid pandemic.
He said: "The care home residents will be missed and we are trying our best to relocate them to new care homes with the help of stakeholders and wish them all to have a safe departure.
"We will be co-operating with all the agencies in order to ensure the safety and care of the residents are looked after.
"The management tried their best along with the staff members to save this lovely care home."
