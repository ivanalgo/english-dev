Conservative MP Miriam Cates has been placed under investigation by Parliament's standards watchdog.
Ms Cates was elected as MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, South Yorkshire, in 2019.
It is not known exactly what the investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards relates to.
However it is claimed she caused "significant damage to the reputation of the House as a whole, or of its members generally".  
The details of investigations by the Standards Commissioner, Daniel Greenberg, are kept confidential until the inquiry is concluded and those under investigation are barred from discussing the allegations.
Ms Cates is part of the New Conservatives group, which has called for radical measures to cut migration.
She has been outspoken in her concern about declining fertility rates in Britain, calling for policies to promote marriage and having children.
She is one of eight MPs currently being investigated by the standards commissioner, including Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing, veteran conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin, and Reclaim MP Andrew Bridgen.
