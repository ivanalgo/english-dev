About 200 mourners have paid tribute at the funeral in Cardiff of former Welsh Rugby Union president Dennis Gethin.
The coffin of Mr Gethin, who died last month aged 79, was draped in the colours of his home village club, Seven Sisters, at Thornhill Crematorium.
It was carried inside by current and former Wales internationals Alun Wyn Jones, George North, Sam Warburton, Ken Owens, Robert Howley and Robin McBryde.
Broadcaster Peter Johnson said he had been "lucky to call him a friend".
After the Judy Collins song Turn Turn Turn was played, the service was led by Dr Barry Morgan, the former Archbishop of Wales.
Mr Gethin's widow Jan spoke of meeting her husband when they worked together in local government in the 1970s.
He was chief executive of Taff Ely Borough Council from 1982 until his retirement in 1996, and was a member of the Audience Council for the BBC in Wales.
Mrs Gethin said he was very proud of Seven Sisters in Neath Port Talbot, had a great sense of humour, and would often tease those he met with his "natural wit".
She added that he "never took himself too seriously", and being elected president of the WRU was a moment of pride.
She spoke movingly about his dementia diagnosis and thanked those who remained friends with him in his "infinitely difficult, precious final days". 
Mourners clapped as she said: "Nos da my lovely boy, I love you cariad."
Those wearing splashes of red then sang the hymn Calon LÃ¢n.
After celebrating their friendship, Mr Johnson said Mr Gethin had a sense of humour "drier than the Sahara" and was "warm, kind and incredibly generous".
