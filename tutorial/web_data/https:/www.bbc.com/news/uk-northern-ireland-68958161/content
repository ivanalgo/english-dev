A County Armagh woman has been threatened by a man with a knife after a hose was put in the letterbox of her Lurgan home and the water turned on.
It happened at the house in Kilvergan Heights at about 06:45 BST on Saturday.
The woman came downstairs and opened the front door after water had been put into her home from the hosepipe.
A masked man with a knife, who was dressed all in black, threatened her and grabbed at her before leaving on foot towards Kilvergan Road.
Police said the woman was left "extremely distressed" and have appealed for anyone with information to contact them.
