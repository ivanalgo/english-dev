The final pieces of track have been laid to help relieve a long-standing bottleneck in a multimillion-pound railway upgrade.
The work is part of the Hope Valley Railway Upgrade to improve journeys between Manchester and Sheffield.
Totalling 850m (2,789ft) in length, the track forms part of a new passing loop between Bamford and Hathersage stations.
It will allow passenger trains to pass slower freight trains on the route.
The Â£137m scheme to "design and deliver" the improvements was revealed in the House of Commons in March 2021.
Construction of the passing loop took place over the past year during two full weekend line closures, with engineers working to complete major elements of work.
 A total of 1,323 sleepers were laid for the new track along with 3,600 tonnes of ballast for the bottom and top stone, Network Rail said.
The passing loop is expected to be ready from the Spring on completion of signalling work.
