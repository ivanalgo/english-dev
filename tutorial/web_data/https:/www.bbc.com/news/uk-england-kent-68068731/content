Greggs has scrapped plans for a 24-hour licence at one of its Kent branches after fears were raised it could lead to anti-social behaviour.
The bakery giant submitted an application to provide a round-the-clock service at its Canterbury city centre site last summer.
But the chain has since ditched the bid, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). 
Greggs did not comment on why it had withdrawn the application. 
The planning withdrawal has been welcomed by those who believe St George's Street - where McDonald's, next door to Greggs, is already open 24 hours - can be "intimidating" at night.
Canterbury city councillor and Westgate ward resident Pip Hazelton opposed the application.
"My concern is up the top end of St George's Street, there's been a history of anti-social behaviour, of groups gathering and those kinds of thing," she said.
"The litter, the noise, even relatively small groups of people hanging about - that can be intimidating for other people."
But Labour councillor Mel Dawkins welcomed the proposals at the time, saying: "I'm certainly happy to have more nightlife economy."
Police did not object to the plans - as long as the shop functioned only as a takeaway during late-night hours, and had two security guards working from 23:00-0500.
A Greggs spokesperson said: "We continue to look at opportunities to extend the opening hours of our shops."
The company previously attempted to get a licence for its Leicester Square branch to operate 24 hours, but was blocked by Westminster City Council.
Its Lord Street store in Liverpool is open 24 hours a day, five days a week. 
A Canterbury City Council spokesperson confirmed the application had been withdrawn.
