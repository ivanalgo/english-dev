Drivers facing the closure of a Derby road are taking matters into their own hands by bypassing the barriers and driving along the pavement, police have said.
Officers say a Severn Trent roadworks closure close to a shopping area in Littleover is surprising motorists.
They blame a lack of signage on the approach.
As a result, people are driving over paved areas when they arrive at the closure.
The precinct around the Stenson Road staggered junction with Breedon Avenue and Blagreaves Lane is being mounted by vehicles they warn. 
They say this unofficial - and "extremely dangerous" - bypass is putting pedestrians at risk.
The beat team for Littleover, Mickleover and Sunny Hill areas of the city has issued a warning on social media.
It said: "Please be aware that Stenson Road is closed. This is not clearly signposted until you reach the road closure.
"Please do not drive onto the pavement and through the shopping precinct to bypass this closure as this is extremely dangerous for pedestrians. 
"We appreciate how frustrating this closure is, but hopefully Severn Trent will be reopening the road soon."
According to Derby City Council, the road closure is scheduled to remain in force until 16:00 BST on Wednesday.
