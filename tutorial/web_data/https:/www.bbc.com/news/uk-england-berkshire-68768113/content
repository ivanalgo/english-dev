Firefighters have tackled a blaze at a large pub in a Berkshire village.
The fire at The Bull Inn in Arborfield Cross, near Reading, had led to Thames Valley Police closing some roads in the area.
The skyline had been seen glowing orange with plumes of smoke billowing from the building.
It took crews from six Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service stations more than three hours to extinguish the fire. 
An outbuilding and patio area in the beer garden of the pub caught fire at about 04:00 BST.
Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said crews from Wokingham, Whitley Wood, Wokingham Road, Caversham Road, Bracknell, Crowthorne and Windsor were deployed to the scene.
Firefighters, wearing breathing apparatus, extinguished the fire using four hose reels and three main jets, before damping down the area.
The force also said its environmental protection unit and incident command unit also attended.
The closed roads have since reopened.
