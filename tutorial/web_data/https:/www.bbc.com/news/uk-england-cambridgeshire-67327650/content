A Cambridgeshire cat that went missing from its home eight months ago has finally been found more than 60 miles (96km) away in London.
Fluffy feline Stark disappeared from his home in Bar Hill and his owners had almost given up hope of finding him.
But as the luck of the black cat would have it, "Starky" had been cared for by office workers in the capital and when they had him checked, his microchip revealed his true owners.
He is now settling back in at his home.
His owners had searched far and wide for their wayward moggy and placed adverts in papers and on websites in the hope someone would find their cat, as Cambridgeshire Live first reported.
Ashleigh Archer and her husband William had no idea where their cat could be, she told the BBC.
"Starky had always been an explorer but he'd always greet my husband when he came home from work - so when he was missing for a day - and then for longer - we feared the worst," she said.
"We were devastated."
Stark had been best friends with the couple's dog, Winnie, and when a vet told the couple their hound was pining for a playmate they decided to get a kitten - Bucky - but never lost hope that Starky would return.
Towards the end of October, Ms Archer was amazed when a London-based charity - the Celia Hammond Animal Trust - got in touch to say a cat had been brought in - and it was Stark. 
His owners hot-footed it to London and were reunited with their beloved pet.
"He recognised my husband immediately," said Ms Archer.
Once back home, she said Stark went straight to the couple's bedroom - where he always slept on the bed.
"Winnie is so happy to have him back, and he's getting on well with our new kitten," she said.
"We're all over the moon."
Ms Archer wanted to stress the importance of having pets microchipped, as without that, her family would not have been reunited with Stark.
