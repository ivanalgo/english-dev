Plans to build almost 4,000 new homes in Central Bedfordshire have been rejected by council officers.
The Greenwoods scheme, proposed to be built alongside the A6 between Barton Le Clay and Silsoe, included plans to create shops, schools and a solar park.
Reasons for refusal included perceived harm to the green belt and the setting of Wrest Park.
Independent councillor Anna French praised the decision, saying residents had opposed the "monstrous proposal".
The plans included 3,750 homes, care apartments and a nursing home, a health centre, education sites from nursery level up to sixth form, sports facilities and a new woodland.
Planning documents showed 1,533 objections to the development, with one in favour.
Listed reasons for the rejection included the possibility of "unacceptable traffic congestion", "significant and wide-ranging harm to the landscape" and concerns around flood planning.
Residents from a group called "No to Greenwoods" had been campaigning against the plans and started a petition in 2021, which received 2,748 signatures. 
Ms French said: "It's a relief to find that the proposals have been rejected after this long wait, which has put such a strain on those who have dedicated their time and energy having to oppose it."
The developer has been contacted for comment.
