A section of motorway will close later for further repairs to a bridge, National Highways said.
Lane closures were put in place on the M62 Ouse Bridge near Goole in March 2022 after damaged joints were found.
The current contraflow will be removed to allow engineers to work on the central reservation.
The agency said the eastbound route would be closed completely between junction 36 and 37 at Howden from 20:00 BST on Wednesday to 06:00.
The westbound route will close on Thursday overnight.
A further overnight eastbound closure is scheduled for 28 May and westbound on 30 May.
Eight joints across both carriageways need replacing, with the completion date for the works having been extended several times.
National Highways project manager John Stebbing said that the work was "on track" for completion "in late summer". 
"During the overnight closures, we advise drivers to allow more time and follow the signed diversion routes," he said.
"This has been a very complex scheme and we're extremely grateful to motorists and residents for their patience while this work has been carried out."
