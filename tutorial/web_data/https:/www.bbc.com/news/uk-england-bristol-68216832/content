Two youths facing double murder charges have been remanded in custody following a court hearing.
They are accused of murdering Max Dixon, 16, and 15-year-old Mason Rist, who were attacked in Knowle West, Bristol, on the evening of 27 January.
The youths, aged 14 and 17, were excused from attending the hearing.
The pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will next appear at Bristol Crown Court on 26 April for a plea and trial preparation hearing.
They will appear alongside two other boys, aged 15 and 16, and 44-year-old Antony Snook - all also accused of the murders of Mason and Max.
Jamie Ogbourne, 26, of Bishport Avenue and 22-year-old Bailey Westcott, of Vowell Close, who are both accused of two charges of assisting an offender, will also appear.
Max and Mason were attacked in Ilminster Avenue and taken by ambulance to Southmead Hospital and Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, where they died in the early hours of 28 January.
A total of 13 people have now been arrested by Avon and Somerset Police as part of the inquiry into their deaths.
They include a 46-year-old man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, who remains in custody for questioning.
A 14-year-old girl and a 49-year-old woman who were also arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender have both been released on conditional bail.
Two other people arrested have been released on conditional bail and no further action has been taken against another arrested person.
A provisional trial date of 7 October has been fixed for the group facing murder charges.
