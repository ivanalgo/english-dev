Speed limit reductions have been approved for the A631 between Market Rasen and Louth.
Since 2010 there have been 260 casualties on that stretch of road, including eight fatalities.
Three sections of the road have been given new speed limits to improve safety and reduce collisions.
The decision was agreed unanimously by councillors at a Lincolnshire County Council meeting on 12 February.
There will be new 50mph limits between Market Rasen and North Willingham, North Willingham and Ludford, and on both approaches to South Elkington.
A new 40mph limit has also been agreed for the developed area further south to include the junction with the A157.
There will also be an extension to the existing 30mph speed limit on Willingham Road in Market Rasen.
Councillor Stephen Bunney, representing Market Rasen Wolds, said "it is very clear" that people in North Willingham are concerned about the speed on the route, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
He also said that the De Aston School in Market Rasen is "regularly impacted" by traffic issues and he hopes the speed alterations will make it safer for students.
Nine local residents rejected the speed reductions, saying that it could lead to "riskier overtaking manoeuvres" and that it would "unreasonably" extend journey times.
In 2016 the county council was granted funding from the government's Â£175m safer roads fund, to improve the A631 between Market Rasen and Louth.
Speed cameras, additional signage and road markings were installed and lower speed limits and junction improvement have been put in place using the funding.
