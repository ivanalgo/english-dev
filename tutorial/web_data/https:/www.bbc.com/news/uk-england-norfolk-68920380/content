A couple who survived a head-on crash on holiday in Iceland became engaged in their hospital beds after nurses reunited them in intensive care.
Elliot Griffiths, 26, and Zak Nelson, 28, of Norwich, were rescued from their smashed hire car within hours of arriving in Reykjavik.
An emotional Mr Nelson said neither had any idea whether the other was alive.
"I was wheeled towards his bed, Elliot saw me, said hello and asked me to marry him - I said yes," he added.
"We spoke for five minutes and all the nurses were cheering and saying 'this is our first engagement in ICU'."
After their brief reunion, Mr Griffiths had to be whisked off for emergency surgery after suffering internal bleeding in the collision.
He continues to recover in hospital in Reykjavik, with Mr Nelson at his bedside since being discharged two days after the accident, on 21 April. 
Mr Nelson, a First Bus marketing executive, was badly bruised after he said a car in the opposite lane pulled out and collided with them head-on.
He believed their car had been doing about 55mph (89km/h) at the time.
"The car rolled and the next thing I know the alarm on my watch is blaring, calling the emergency services," he told BBC Radio Norfolk.
"People were opening the doors and talking to us.
"We are lucky to be alive, when you see the picture of the car."
Mr Nelson, who admits he usually posts "happy bus-related" updates on TikTok, had filmed emotional videos about their ordeal after returning to their hotel alone.
A follow-up video on social media about their "happy news" from Mr Griffiths's bedside has since attracted more than 57,000 likes.
Thanking the people of Iceland for their offers of help, Mr Nelson said: "Hopefully we'll return once we're better and see the rest of your beautiful country."
