Drivers have been warned about delays as heavy equipment is removed from a Lincolnshire road.
Short Ferry Road, in Shortferry near Lincoln, flooded during Storm Babet in October and also during Storm Henk in early January.
Water pumps and machinery were sent to the scene by the Environment Agency.
Lincolnshire County Council said there would be a series of 15-minute-long closures of the road while the equipment was removed.
Karen Cassar, assistant director for highways at Lincolnshire County Council, said the closures would start on Monday and were scheduled to run until Tuesday evening.
"The Environment Agency's team will be on-site and will use signed boards to tell road users when the mini closures are active," she said.
"The road will be reopened again as soon as possible after the individual phases of the removal work.
She added: "Whilst the closures will be in place for a few minutes at a time, there will be some periods where traffic users may have to wait for the road to reopen.
"The mini delays are unavoidable during the operation, and I would like to thank everyone effected by these works for their patience and understanding."
