A 22-year-old man wanted in Spain over an alleged murder has been arrested in Northern Ireland.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said an extradition warrant had been issued by Spanish authorities.
PSNI officers in Lurgan, County Armagh, worked with the National Crime Agency and Spanish authorities to track down the wanted person at an address in the Craigavon area on Friday night.
He will be brought before an extradition court in Belfast on Sunday.
