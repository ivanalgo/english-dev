A man armed with a crossbow who was shot by police after he broke into a home was hit in the neck and chest, his inquest has heard.
Convicted stalker Bryce Hodgson, from Sheffield, was shot dead on 30 January in Surrey Quays, south-east London.
Southwark Coroner's Court heard that the 30-year-old had gained entrance to the property in Bywater Place armed with the crossbow and other weapons.
Police watchdog the IOPC is investigating the incident.
Senior coroner Dr Julian Morris said: "Police were called to the scene and, when he exhibited some threatening behaviour, armed response units were called and subsequently shots were fired.
"He was pronounced dead at the scene."
A provisional post-mortem examination report found Hodgson died from gunshot wounds to his neck and chest.
Harriet Griffiths, the IOPC's lead investigator on the case, said: "Police units attended but were unable to detain him and they were shortly followed by their firearms colleagues, who, as you know, fired shots."
The inquest heard that Hodgson was single and working in IT at the time of his death, and his last known address was in south-east London.
The hearing was adjourned for the IOPC to continue its investigation.
