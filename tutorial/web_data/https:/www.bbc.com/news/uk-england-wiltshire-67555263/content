A gaggle of geese described as "little characters" of a Wiltshire village have been missing for two weeks, with concerns they may have been killed.
The geese have been a common sight in Upavon for more than a decade.
But locals residents said they saw tyre marks where the birds usually stay, and fear some may have been killed.
The chair of the parish council said most villagers "love" the geese, but they "got on some people's nerves". Police are not investigating.
Charles Leigh-Bennett said some drivers became impatient when having to slow down to let the birds cross the road, and some people would get annoyed at mess left on the pavement. 
"But everyone acknowledged they were the characters of the village," he added.
He said three of the six geese, who stayed in a grassy area in the village, disappeared around the same time the tyre marks were spotted, and then the rest of the birds disappeared a few days later. 
Wiltshire Police were told about the situation on 18 November, but said they are not investigating.
It is understood that because the birds are not technically owned by someone, it is not a crime.
Mr Leigh-Bennett said the geese's disappearance looked to locals and the parish council like it could be an "act of wanton violence and cruelty". 
He added that they believe at least three of them have been killed. No bodies have been found. 
He explained the council was waiting to see if the birds reappeared and, if not, would then look into importing some. 
They will make a formal decision in January.
