A man has been held on suspicion of a gangmaster offence after investigators raided a farm in Nottinghamshire.
The Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) said the raid was carried out with Nottinghamshire Police and Immigration Enforcement in Calverton on Thursday.
A 41-year-old man, from Belgium, was arrested on suspicion of acting as a gangmaster without a licence.
The suspect was released on bail until December, the GLAA said. 
Searches were also conducted by the GLAA at properties in Lowdham and Nottingham.
A gangmaster is a business or individual that employs people with agriculture, horticulture, and dairy farming work.
Gangmasters must be licensed by the GLAA before recruiting workers.
