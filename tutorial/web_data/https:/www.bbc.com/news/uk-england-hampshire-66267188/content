A university's statue of Greta Thunberg that was branded a "vanity project" has been temporarily taken down.
The Â£24,000 statue, installed in 2021 at the University of Winchester, is set to move to a "more stable plinth".
A spokesperson said the new location would be in the courtyard garden at the university's West Downs Centre.
The university believed it was the world's first life-sized sculpture of the "inspirational" Swedish environmental activist.
But at the time of its installing there was some criticism from students, with the union questioning if the money could have been better spent.
Winchester University and College Union (UCU) also passed a motion describing the statue as a "vanity project".
A spokesperson for the University said: "The removal has taken place to provide a more stable plinth for the statue so it can be enjoyed for years to come.
"The statue, along with other works of art on campus, is a popular destination for visitors to our campus. 
"We will be delighted to continue welcoming anyone who wishes to view it once the work is completed."
