An archery club that has been running for nearly 70 years is in a race to find a new home before its lease expires.
Merdon Bowmen Archery Club, founded in 1954, must leave its current premises in Dundridge, Hampshire, next summer.
Efforts to secure a new range have so far been unsuccessful and there are fears the club may be forced to close in its landmark anniversary year.
The group is appealing for help finding a new field so it can continue running.
A spokesman said: "Merdon Bowmen Archery Club has been an integral part of the local community for decades. 
"We are hopeful that the community will rally behind us in our search for a new field, ensuring the continuation of our club's legacy."
The club, which is affiliated to Archery GB, has more than 50 members.
Any new field will need to accommodate parking spaces, a club hut, equipment shed and a safe archery range which must be flat, private and inaccessible to the general public.
