A major redevelopment of a 109-year-old west London market has been given the green light.
New homes, stalls and a nine-storey building are to be built at Shepherd's Bush Market.
Three of the five Hammersmith and Fulham councillors at a meeting on Tuesday meeting voted in favour of the plans.
A meeting earlier this month was adjourned due to protests by Protect Shepherd's Bush Market campaigners. 
The group described the latest decision as "shameful".
It has raised concerns about applicant Yoo Capital's proposals, in particular regarding the protection of traders' leases and the financial support offered to help resolve issues such as leaking arches.
Yoo Capital's plans for the market, which runs between Goldhawk Road and Uxbridge Road, also involve various aesthetic improvements, such as putting up new entrance signs and cleaning up the arches.
Jake Simms, a member of Protect Shepherd's Bush Market, told committee members that Yoo Capital intended to maximise the profit of the site by "reducing the number of traders on the market". Mr Simms said 25 had already left, with a "significant number" planning to do the same in the near future.
Andrew Thorpe, managing director at Yoo Capital, said: "The market needs investment to survive. Our plans provide this while respecting the character of the market and the individuality of its businesses. 
"We are proposing to improve the infrastructure of the market and provide a Â£5.5m package of support for the traders."
