A community theatre has celebrated the completion of major renovation works. 
The project at The Seagull in Lowestoft, Suffolk, has spent 18 months improving accessibility in the building for those with reduced mobility.
The adjustments included widening doorways, installing a lift, creating additional wheelchair spaces in the auditorium and new workshop areas.
Karen Read, the theatre's manager, said it was the start of a "wonderful chapter for our fabulous Seagull". 
The not-for-profit venue is based in a former Victorian school building. 
It was originally converted into a theatre in the 1960s, before it became a community-run enterprise in 2007. 
"We are so thrilled with all the improvements we have been able to make at The Seagull," Ms Read continued. 
"We are first and foremost a community venue, and being able to make our building more accessible for every customer of that community has been our priority for some time."
The renovation project saw the creation of an accessible workshop to allow more community groups to undertake practical work in the theatre, while the new lift will allow visitors with reduced mobility to reach studios in the upper floors for the first time. 
A new box office has been developed, which the theatre said was now accessible for disabled volunteers and has a lowered serving area for customers in wheelchairs. 
Other works included refreshing the stage floor, upgrading the dressings room and additional priority parking spaces.
Throughout the building project, the theatre ensured "much thought has been given to environmental sustainability". It has used energy efficient lighting, low power heating and extra insulation. 
The project cost about Â£750,000 and was funded by the Arts Council and the Youth Investment Fund.
