Oxfam is looking to recruit a record number of volunteers for what it has called its "biggest ever year of festivals".
The charity is looking for 8,500 volunteers to work on events such as Glastonbury, Reading, Latitude and Isle of Wight Festival.
They get free entry in exchange for stewarding on three eight-hour shifts.
Charlie, 30, who has volunteered for Reading Festival four times, said he "fell in love with the concept".
Oxfam said volunteers could apply for as many festivals as they like, for roles involving checking tickets and wristbands at the gates and supporting accessible viewing platforms by the stages.
Last year, volunteers gave over 206,000 hours of their time over the summer and helped raise Â£1.5m to support Oxfam's poverty fighting work.
Michael Lever, head of festivals and events, said they had built "a friendly and passionate community of volunteers", some of whom had attended more than 100 festivals.
Charlie said his volunteering experience with Oxfam started eight years ago when he and his cousins could not afford tickets for the Isle of Wight Festival.
"Initially for me, it was all about the free ticket," he remembers.
"But then I fell in love with the concept of it and haven't paid for a festival ticket since."
Information on how to apply and the full list of festivals for 2024 can be found on the charity's festivals website.
