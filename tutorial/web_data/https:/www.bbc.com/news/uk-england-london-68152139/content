A man shot dead by police after breaking into a south London home armed with weapons, including a crossbow, was a convicted stalker who was banned from entering the road where he was shot.
Bryce Hodgson, 30, was given a suspended jail term in July last year.
Court documents showed he had a restraining order imposed after admitting entering a woman's bedroom without consent.
He died after forcing his way into a home in Surrey Quays early on Tuesday.
Police were called just before 05:00 GMT when Hodgson tried to enter the house, wearing body armour and threatening to harm those inside.
Weapons including crossbows, a knife, a sword and a hatchet were found at the scene.
Key crime stat excludes sexual assaults
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating the shooting.
Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist, who has overall responsibility for firearms, said he "firmly" believed police actions "prevented further loss of life".
He added: "The first unarmed officers knew they were arriving on scene to reports of a man armed with weapons and threatening to harm people inside an address.
"The officers knew there were people inside and had genuine fears for their safety.
"Armed officers were called and attempted to get the man to surrender. They entered the property and shots were fired.
"I would like to pay tribute to the bravery of all our officers who responded and thank all the emergency service staff involved."
