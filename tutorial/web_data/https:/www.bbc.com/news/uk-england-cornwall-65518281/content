A fisherman has been airlifted after being injured on board a vessel off the coast of Cornwall.

The man was on board a French fishing boat when he was thought to have injured his pelvis, coastguards said.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency helicopter took him to a hospital unit in Plymouth for treatment.  
The RNLI's Lizard lifeboat was also called out to the incident.
