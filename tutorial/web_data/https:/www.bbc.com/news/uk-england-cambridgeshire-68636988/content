The Liberal Democrats have won a tightly-contested council by-election in a previous Conservative stronghold.
The party took the seat of Yaxley and Farcet on Cambridgeshire County Council.
Andrew Richard Wood secured 509 votes - defeating his Conservative rival Kev Gulson by 39 votes.
The contest was held following the death of long-serving Tory councillor for the ward, Mac McGuire, earlier this year.
The result means the Lib Dems have now become the largest party on the council - with 23 councillors.
It has run the authority as part of a coalition alongside Labour and independents since 2021.
