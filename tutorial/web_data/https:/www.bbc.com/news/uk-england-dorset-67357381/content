A wood chopping competitor has admitted things "didn't quite come together on the night" as he took to the world stage.
Tom Redmond, 38, from Bere Regis, Dorset, was part of a six-man team representing Great Britain at the Stihl Timbersports World Championship.
They finished 14th out of 19 teams in the event at the Porsche-Arena in Stuttgart, Germany.
He described the results in the lumberjack-style challenges as "mixed".
The team also came 16th in a time-trial event and did not make it to the quarter-finals.
Mr Redmond told the BBC afterwards that it "unfortunately wasn't quite what we were hoping for" despite "some really good times in the training weekends".
"We still had a couple of good runs but the level of competition was very high," he explained.
"We've definitely come away with a few more bits to work on for sure."
The championships featured a variety of logger sports, with 120 athletes from more than 20 nations competing over two days.
Disciplines included the stock saw, which involves chopping a block of wood with a chainsaw, and the underhand chop, where a horizontal block is cut through with an axe.
Mr Redmond's discipline is the single buck in which he uses a 2m (6.6ft) hand-pulled saw to horizontally slice through a block. 
"It's definitely a sport where the more you do, the more that you would want to put into it to try and get it back again," he said.
"But for me I could definitely do it again after this year's competitions. I know where I've got to go, and I've got to go and put some more work in to try and improve for next season."
Also on the Great Britain team were Robert Chatley, Jack Morris, Graham Turner, George Spencer and British champion Glen Penlington.
