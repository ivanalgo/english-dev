A £2 coin with a rare mistake could sell for more than £1,200 at auction.
The coin is being auctioned in Wiltshire  and features the image of Lord Kitchener, famous from World War One recruitment posters.
It is believed to be the rarest documented coin with an error in circulation, with the mistake a lack of text saying it is actually worth £2.
RWB Auctions said it has been authenticated by The Royal Mint Museum and comes with a signed letter.
The Royal Mint produced around 5,720,000 of the Lord Kitchener £2 coins, which marked 100 years since the outbreak of the war.
The standard version is not unusual, but one without the words two pounds are rare.
Experts at The Royal Mint Museum said the wrong design - on the heads side - was stamped onto the coin during production. 
The letter being sold with the coin is from the museum's Information and Research Manager.
It is being sold at RWB Auctions in Royal Wootton Bassett on Wednesday.
