Councils are offering free or reduced-price fees at their car parks in the days leading up to Christmas. 
Leaders said the initiatives were aimed at supporting local businesses and helping shoppers.
While Stuart Elford, chief executive of Devon and Plymouth Chamber of Commerce, said these had been "unprecedented times" for businesses. 
He called on people to "support the local economy".
Mr Elford said businesses had been impacted by Brexit, the pandemic, energy price rises, the cost of living crisis, the war in Ukraine's impact on the supply chain, rising inflation and interest rates. 
He added: "Small local businesses may suffer more than most and so we should all do our bit to support our local economy by spending in our area whenever we can." 
Councillor Steve Darling, leader of Torbay Council, said town centres and local businesses were "at the heart" of Torbay. 
Councillor Andrew Moore, cabinet member for finances, said parking offers were an opportunity for people to "see what market towns have to offer".
