A 17ft boa constrictor has been found among 27 dead snakes and four chickens dumped in boxes, bin bags and pillowcases on the side of the road.
RSPCA inspector Keith Hogben said it was one of the worst cases he has had to deal with in 25 years.
He is attempting to arrange post-mortem examinations for the creatures, which were found in Waterston, Pembrokeshire.
"The snakes ranged from 1ft to 17ft in length and were all in various forms of decomposition," he said.
"I believe all the snakes are of a constrictor type. There were also four dead white chickens found alongside the snakes that I believe were most likely food for the larger snakes.
"I think I can honestly say this is one of the worst things I've dealt with in 25 years.
"It is very sad to think that these poor snakes could have been suffering for some time."
