An astronomer who was part of a team who uncovered the largest cosmic explosion has set off to complete seven marathons in seven days for charity.
Dr Philip Wiseman from the University of Southampton has taken on the challenge in aid of the MS Society.
His mum, Ann Wiseman, has been living with progressive MS for many years.
He set off from near Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire on a route that will take him to Hampshire ending at the London Marathon on Sunday.
The 31-year-old from Chandlers Ford has set a fundraising target of Â£7,777 and plans to wear a striking outfit each day - ranging from tutus to lederhosen.
He said: "My mum's progressive MS was diagnosed almost 20 years ago and, with this year being her 65th birthday, I wanted to take on a significant challenge to raise money and awareness of multiple sclerosis.
"I have run marathons before, so it needed to be something bigger than that. I just hope I can make it through seven days back-to-back."
His route takes in places that are meaningful to him - including Gloucestershire, his childhood home, and Southampton, where his parents met in the late '70s as University of Southampton students.
As he runs through his hometown Chandler's Ford on Thursday, Dr Wiseman will be joined by members of his running club, the Chandler's Ford Swifts.
The Research Fellow in Astrophysics led a team at the university who analysed an explosion, known as AT2021lwx which took place nearly eight billion light years away.
The explosion has lasted more than three years, much longer than most supernovae which are usually only visibly bright for a few months.
