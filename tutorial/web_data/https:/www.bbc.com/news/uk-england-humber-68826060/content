Three people were injured when the land train at Bridlington had to "brake harshly" to avoid hitting a loose dog.
In a social media post East Riding of Yorkshire Council said one passenger was left with a bloodied nose and another with a swollen wrist.
The driver was left "visibly shaken by the incident" after he narrowly missed the dog which ran in front of the train, the council added.
The dog returned to its owner who was around 300ft (100m) away.
The incident took place near Sewerby cliff top on Friday.
Witnesses said the dog was chasing the train before running in front of it.
A council spokesperson said: "We would urge dog owners to please keep their pets under control and preferably on leads along our land train routes in Bridlington and on Sewerby cliffs so we can avoid incidents like this and keep everyone safe." 
In its Facebook post, the council's Coastal Services team said: "Whilst our drivers make every effort to avoid hitting loose dogs, if an uncontrolled dog is injured or killed by a land train the council will take no responsibility for it and passenger safety will always take priority.
"Please keep your dog under control at all times when walking on promenades and Sewerby cliff top and help us keep everybody safe."
The popular attraction has been running during the holiday season in the seaside resort since 1962.
The trains run every 30 mins on two routes from the South Promenade to Sewerby to the north of the town.
