A Â£6m donation from James Dyson to fund a primary school expansion has been approved by the government.
Malmesbury Primary School will use the funding to add a new science, technology, engineering, art and maths centre to its site in Wiltshire.
Wiltshire Council had been concerned about what an expansion would mean for neighbouring schools.
Dyson's charity has been looking at the details in the approval documents.
The plans for the centre became controversial when the council said an expansion at one school could affect the future of other nearby primaries.
Then Sir James Dyson wrote to The Times newspaper, describing trying to donate the money as a "battle".
Wiltshire Council has said it "welcomes the contribution to these key areas as a whole", but council leaders are worried about investment going to one location and what a big influx of new school places would mean for the survival of other nearby schools.
Councillor Laura Mayes, Cabinet Member for Children's Services, explained that while they had a plan for future demand in the area already, "we now have the government's final decision and we will work with everyone involved to ensure we achieve the best outcomes for all our pupils."
The expansion would see purpose-built rooms equipped for design, technology, art, science, and mathematics-based activities as well as additional classrooms. 
If everything is agreed, including planning permission, it is expected to be open to pupils from September 2027.
The government said there needs to be agreement on how increases in pupil numbers will be managed before building work can start.
Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said: "This new centre will provide world-class facilities for pupils in Malmesbury and the surrounding areas to inspire them and develop the skills we need to compete on the world stage."
