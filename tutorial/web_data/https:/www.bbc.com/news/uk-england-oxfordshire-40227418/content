A Â£9.3 million cash boost has been promised for council-run leisure centres across west Oxfordshire.
Plans include an indoor trampoline park at Carterton, extra gym space and sensory room at Windrush and a cafe revamp at Woodstock Outdoor Pool. 
West Oxfordshire District Council said it aimed to double the amount of visitors to 1.5 million.
It added the investment would have "a fantastic impact on the health and wellbeing" of many residents.
The funding, distributed over 10 years, will come from GLL, which manages Bartholomew Sports Centre in Eynsham, Carterton ATP, Carterton Leisure Centre, Carterton Pavilion, Chipping Norton Leisure Centre, Windrush Leisure Centre in Witney, Witney Artificial Turf Pitch and Woodstock Open Air Pool.
