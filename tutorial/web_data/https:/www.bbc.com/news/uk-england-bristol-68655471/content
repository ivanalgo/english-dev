Two security guards were assaulted and racially abused after interrupting a burglary on a houseboat. 
Police said a man stole items from the boat in the Floating Harbour area of Bristol, near Temple Way, at around 18:45 GMT on 3 January.
Officers have now released an image of a man they hope to identify.
He is described as white, in his 50s, with black hair and around 5ft 8ins (1.7m) tall. â€‹
He was also said to be partially bald and was wearing a grey hooded top with a black bomber jacket, grey jeans, white trainers and a black and white hat.
The two victims did not require hospital treatment.
Police are asking anyone who may recognise the man, or anyone who may have information, to get in touch with them.
