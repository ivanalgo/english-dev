Police have stepped up patrols in Barnstaple in the run up to Christmas.
Insp Andy Wills said that the police presence was "even more obvious" as a result of Safer Streets funding.
The Home Office awarded North Devon Council and the Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez more than Â£500,000 in July to tackle anti-social behaviour.
The money has also been used to hire street marshals and increase CCTV coverage in the town.
Insp Wills said there had been a 19% reduction in anti-social behaviour in Barnstaple between November 2021 and November 2022.
"It's a result of us really getting to grips with a number of local issues," he said.
