A 66-bed retirement home could be built on the site of a Derbyshire truck stop and café.
Plans have been submitted for the Salt Box in Hatton, near Tutbury, that could see a two-storey care home created.
Off the busy route between Hatton and the A50, the Salt Box site is currently home to a café, truck parking and truck wash, alongside one home.
But, if given the green light, these could be replaced with a retirement home including dementia care.
A spokesperson for the Salt Box café told the BBC it is "business as usual" for the foreseeable future, despite the application being submitted.
Applicant LNT Care Developments has told South Derbyshire District Council that some 50 to 60 jobs would be created by the new facility.
It would provide 66 single bed rooms with en-suite facilities.
The building would also include a café for visitors.
Comments on the scheme can be made to the planning authority before 8 March. 
The council hopes to make a decision on the plan before the end of April.
