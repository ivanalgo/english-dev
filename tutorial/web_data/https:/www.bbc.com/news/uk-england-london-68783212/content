A man has been jailed for five months for "abusive and violent behaviour" towards cabin crew after he was told to stop vaping in a plane's toilets.
Omar Edwards, 26, "caused alarm and distress to other passengers" on board the flight from Jamaica to London Gatwick on 12 November 2022.
Edwards, from Bow, in east London, was also found guilty of assault.
As well as the prison term he must pay compensation of £2,400 to the victims on board, a £500 fine and court costs.
He was prosecuted under the Air Navigation Order 2016.
Crawley Magistrates' Court heard that Edwards was first to board the aircraft, and was seen grabbing items from seats in an area of the aircraft he was not travelling in.
He then used his vape in the toilet, having previously been warned about vaping on board the outbound flight from London Gatwick.
After being challenged, he became abusive and swore at cabin crew workers, snatched a carton of juice and tried to walk away.
He then assaulted a cabin crew worker.
A Gatwick police spokesperson said: "Edwards' behaviour was so poor he was given an official written warning by the captain on board.
"This case demonstrates that abuse of airline workers is not acceptable and we will pursue offenders to ensure they are prosecuted."
