A new free special school with 160 places for pupils is being planned for Nottinghamshire.
The Department for Education (DfE) said it will provide the funding for the site, which will serve pupils aged between seven and 18.
A spokesman said it will find an academy trust to run the school before identifying a site, with the process "usually" taking three to four years.
Nottinghamshire County Council welcomed the announcement.
The Nottinghamshire school will be one of 16 sites across England; and will help children with special needs such as autism, emotional and behavioural disorders, and learning difficulties.
The county council said it will be "directly supporting" its target to provide 490 more "school and alternative provision places" for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) by 2026.
Sam Smith, cabinet member for education and SEND, said: "This is such positive news and very welcomed for the families of children with SEND in Nottinghamshire."
