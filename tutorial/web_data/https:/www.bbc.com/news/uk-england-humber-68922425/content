A man rescued a deer that had got into difficulty while swimming in the sea at Cleethorpes.
A video posted on social media showed the paddleboarder carrying the animal to safety on Saturday.
Cleethorpes Wildlife Rescue said the animal was not injured and returned by itself to a large herd that lives in nearby woodland.
Aaron Foss from the animal charity said it was not unusual to see them in the water at Cleethorpes beach.
"Deer are very, very good swimmers, but when exhausted can get into difficulty," he said.
"It was stressed when it was rescued, but after about an hour of rest it was fine and required no further intervention."
He praised the actions of the paddleboarder for saving the animal.
