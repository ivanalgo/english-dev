A lorry spill of watermelons forced the M25 to partially close while the motorway was cleared of the fruit.
The spillage occurred on the clockwise carriageway at junction 31 near Purfleet, Essex, National Highways said. 
In an X post it said all lanes had now reopened following the clear-up. 
Drivers endured delays after the carriageway and slip-roads were partially closed to allow for the debris to be removed.
