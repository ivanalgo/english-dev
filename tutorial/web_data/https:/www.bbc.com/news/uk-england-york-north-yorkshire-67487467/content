A Yorkshire Dales community is being invited to have its say on plans to close a small primary school.
Pupil numbers at Fountains Earth Church of England Primary School in Lofthouse, Nidderdale, had steadily fallen, North Yorkshire Council said.
A formal consultation on the planned closure opened on Sunday.
Councillor Annabel Wilkinson said: "This is an important consultation, and it is essential we take everybody's views into account." 
In 2017, when the school was rated "good" by Ofsted, there were 22 pupils.
According to the authority, the school had also experienced "challenges" around financial pressures and teacher recruitment.
Ms Wilkinson, the authority's executive member for education, learning and skills, added: "I would urge members of the Upper Nidderdale community to share their views so that we can make an informed decision as to what steps to take next."
The closing date for the public to comment on the plans is 22 December. In addition, a public meeting will be held at Lofthouse Memorial Institute at 16:00 GMT on 29 November.
The council will consider the feedback in January. If the proposed closure is approved, the school would close on 31 March 2024.
