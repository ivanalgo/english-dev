The education secretary has told a council it can decide whether to fence off part of a school playing field.
Local people raised concerns about Peterborough City Council's plans to limit access to Werrington Fields to safeguard Ken Stimpson Academy pupils.
Gillian Keegan said it would have to remain designated as educational land but the authority could decide whether to build fences there.
The city's Conservative MP Paul Bristow had raised the issue in the Commons.
He posted a response from the education secretary on X - formerly Twitter, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
The council - which is under no overall political control - had asked the government if it could change the designation of the area to "public open space".
In a letter, Ms Keegan responded: "The department refused this decision in November 2023 to ensure local children at the school have access to the open space they deserve."
"Any decision by Peterborough City to fence off parts, or none of, the school's playing field land does not require consent from the department and is entirely a matter for the council - provided the land remains designated as educational land."
Mr Bristow had said many constituents were disappointed by the proposals and urged the council "not to enclose the fields in this way".
The row over Werrington Fields began in 2019, when the council first proposed fencing off part of them for use by the school during term time.
Councillors said the move followed "incidents of antisocial and threatening behaviour".
