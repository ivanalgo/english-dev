A 24-year-old has denied the murder of a man who died more than five years after being stabbed in a fight outside a supermarket.
Jamel Boyce was 17 when he suffered severe brain damage in the attack outside a Sainsbury's store in Clapham, south-west London, in October 2016.
He was left blind, paralysed and unable to speak, and died in a care home in February 2022 at the age of 22.
Tyrese Osei-Kofi appeared at the Old Bailey via video-link.
A post-mortem examination determined Mr Boyce's cause of death was a penetrating injury to the chest.
A trial date for Mr Osei-Kofi, originally from east Dulwich in south-east London, has been set for 28 October at the same court.
