Two people cut off by an incoming tide have been rescued by a lifeboat crew.
RNLI lifeboat station volunteers at Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, were called out by HM Coastguard after the pair got trapped at Blakeney harbour. 
They set off at 18:35 GMT, locating the people with help of a coastguard unit, and took them aboard by 19:05. 
Wells RNLI took them to the shore of Blakeney Carnser "into the care of the coastguards". The pair were "very cold but otherwise unharmed".
The RNLI said: "The lifeboat made good speed in slight sea conditions and arrived on scene at 19:00.
"The inshore lifeboat crew requested further directions to the people cut off by the tide from coastguard units on scene and had the people in sight.
"At 19:05, the inshore lifeboat had located and taken the two people onboard... very cold but otherwise unharmed."
