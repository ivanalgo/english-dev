The Pannier Market in Barnstaple has reopened more than a month after lead was discovered in paint during refurbishment works.
Lead was found in residual waste at the site on 7 October - four days after workers started removing old paint from the roof.
North Devon Council shut the market so the waste could be safely removed.
The market said traders had started moving back in after they were relocated to alternative locations.
Ken Miles, the council's chief executive, said works on old listed buildings could throw up "unexpected challenges".
"In this case, we will look to see whether there was anything that we could have done differently and will take any points forwards into the main works," he said.
"We have been in contact throughout with traders, staff and contractors and we are satisfied that no-one has suffered any harm to their health as a result of the existence of the lead in the paint dust.
"We are now welcoming the traders back into the Pannier Market and also looking forward to the main works to regenerate what is a fantastic building proceeding in the new year."
Air testing has been carried out at the site, officials have said.
