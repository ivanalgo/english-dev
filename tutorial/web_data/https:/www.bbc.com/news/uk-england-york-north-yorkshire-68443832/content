Two caravans have been destroyed in a blaze at a house in North Yorkshire.
North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said they were called to Duggleby, near Malton, at 18:53 GMT on Thursday.
A spokesperson said two crews attended the scene at the residential property, after a report of a "caravan fire" on the drive.
"This fire quickly spread to a second caravan, a shed and a skip located in close proximity," the fire service added.
It said the blaze also burnt through a live electricity cable which then "fell on to the fire ground coming to rest on top of the skip". 
No casualties were reported, but both caravans suffered complete fire damage.
