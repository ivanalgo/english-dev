A police officer who was held at gun point has been awarded for his bravery.
Sgt Thomas Thornton, of Thames Valley Police, attended a report of a domestic incident in Olney, Buckinghamshire, in March 2022.
Once he and a student officer arrived at the scene, a man held an imitation handgun at Sgt Thornton.
Chief Constable Jason Hogg commended Sgt Thornton for calmly convincing the offender to drop the weapon and then arresting him.
Sgt Thornton recalled: "We were going to a standard domestic argument, there didn't appear to be any offences, just a verbal argument.
"I thought it was a real firearm and the first thing he said was 'if you move I'll shot you'.
"I didn't really have anywhere for cover... So I just started speaking to him and urging him to drop the weapon."
While the student officer took cover behind a nearby vehicle, Sgt Thornton successfully appealed to the man to drop the imitation firearm to the ground.
Thames Valley Police said the offender was arrested, convicted and sentenced.
The judge and Crown Prosecution Service also praised the officer's bravery, the force said.
Mr Hogg said: "Sgt Thornton's conduct throughout this incident provides excellent examples of the best of policing principles."
"His actions clearly prevented the incident from escalating, which could have resulted in serious harm to the offender who was clearly intent on having an armed confrontation with police."
While he was pleased with the recognition, Sgt Thornton insisted he did not "ask for any of it".
He added: "I do feel very proud and I can't wait to show my daughter this when she is older."
