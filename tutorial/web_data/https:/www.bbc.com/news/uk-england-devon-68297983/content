A bearcat that managed to escape its enclosure at Dartmoor Zoo has been located, said keepers. 
Dartmoor Zoo said the Palawan Binturong, called Malu, was found in a small woodshed in the Devon countryside. 
They said the animal was quickly secured and transported back to the zoo from Cornwood.
The zoo said the binturong was "settling back in". 
A keeper at the zoo said initial observations indicated Malu had not suffered from his time in the countryside. 
A resident spotted the bearcat on the evening of 13 February and alerted the zoo.
He was found in a small woodshed next to an allotment, so had managed to find shelter and a food source.
Dartmoor Zoo said it would be reviewing the binturong's enclosure over the next 12 to 24 hours to assess any changes that needed to be made. 
At present, Malu would be in a "suitable, temporary enclosure until any works have been completed", the zoo said. 
Zoo CEO David Gibson said they were delighted Malu had been found safe. 
He said: "Our priority now is for his ongoing welfare and care. 
"We will be working hard over the next few days to ensure that he is in good health and that there is no possibility of him escaping his enclosure again."
Binturongs are also known bearcats, although they are not related to bears or cats.
They are members of the family Viverridae and are most closely related to civets, genets, and fossa, the zoo said.
It added binturongs were "incredible creatures, as well as being great climbers, they famously smell of popcorn".
