A legally-binding agreement that could see a council lease land to Oxford United for its new planned stadium has been agreed.
The League One club wants to build a 16,000-capacity venue on land known as the Triangle, near Kidlington.
Oxfordshire County Council approved leasing the land in principle in September but both parties formally announced the deal on Friday.
The authority said it was a "significant milestone".
On being granted planning permission by Cherwell District Council, the county council has agreed it would give the club a 250-year lease. 
The U's chairman, Grant Ferguson, said the deal was a "major step forward" in securing its future as it plans to move out of the Kassam Stadium by summer 2026.
"On behalf of the club, I'd like to extend a thank you to our stadium project team, to all our supporters and to Oxfordshire County Council," Mr Ferguson added.
"We look forward to continuing to work closely with key stakeholders to bring our vision to reality." 
Both parties announced last month the first steps for an agreement had been approved. 
The club's development director Jon Clarke said: "We can move forward with the confidence and the commitment that we can utilise this site, subject to us getting planning permission..."
He added the club was "more than happy" with the arrangement that would mean the county council is its landlord because it gives it an "element of protection".
About 2,900 public comments have been taken off the planning application so respondents' names and addresses can be redacted, Cherwell District Council said. 
All views will be accepted until the application is decided at the authority's planning committee, with a target decision date of 21 June.
The U's will play for a place in the Championship next season when they face Bolton Wanderers in the League One play-off final at Wembley on 18 May.
