A police officer sentenced for possessing "extreme pornography" has been found to have committed gross misconduct.
Former Cambridgeshire Constabulary officer Aidan McKay was based at Huntingdon police station.
At court he admitted a number of sexual offences and was given a 16-month suspended sentence last December.
A hearing on Friday concluded he would have been dismissed from the police had he not already resigned.
McKay, a former constable, was found to have breached the standards of professional behaviour in respect of discreditable conduct, amounting to gross misconduct.
He resigned as a police officer in August 2023 before he appeared before Luton Crown Court on 19 December.
There, McKay admitted three offences of making indecent images of children and possession of extreme pornography.
His 16-month prison sentence was suspended for two years and he was made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order and put on the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years.
The force's chief constable, Nick Dean, said McKay's actions "have done irreparable damage to public confidence".
He said: "His actions have undermined the very essence of policing's core values in protecting the public, especially children and vulnerable people, and helping those in need.
"He showed complete disregard to the privileged position that was bestowed upon him as a police officer."
Mr Dean said he was committed to removing people who "fail to demonstrate the standards that everyone expects from policing".
