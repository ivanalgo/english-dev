A bank has issued a warning to its customers in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man following a spate of scams.
HSBC said fraudsters are pretending to be members of its staff and trying to trick people out of money.
The bank said the scammers pose as trustworthy organisations to encourage people to hand over personal or financial information.
Customers are asked not click on unfamiliar links, and to end calls if someone asks for personal details.
In a statement, HSBC said: "We see scams where customers are told their account has been compromised, or they need to move their money to a 'safe account'.
"This is not genuine and your bank will never ask you to do this."
The bank said it recommended people take a moment to determine whether the email seems suspicious.
It added: "[HSBC] will never ask you to share passwords or PIN numbers, or to move your money. If in doubt, call your bank on the number shown on the back of your debit card."
"We want all our customers to be alert that, if you receive an unexpected phone call about money, there's a good chance it's a scam.
"Scammers may claim to be a business or authority you know and trust. They may know personal details about you and can even make their phone number look authentic using 'number spoofing'.
"But if someone calls you out of the blue and asks you to move money or share your account details, just hang up."
If customers think they may have been scammed, they should contact the bank immediately using the number on their card or visit a branch if they are unable to call.
