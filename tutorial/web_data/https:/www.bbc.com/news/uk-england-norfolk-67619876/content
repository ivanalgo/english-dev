The chief executive of two of the largest zoos in the East of England is stepping down amid "widespread abuse" following redundancy announcements. 
The Zoological Society of East Anglia (ZSEA), which runs Banham Zoo in Norfolk and Africa Alive at Kessingland, Suffolk, said about 10% of its 200 staff would lose their jobs.
Its boss, Claudia Roberts was now resigning her post, it said.
The charity said the "abuse" aimed at Ms Roberts was "wholly unacceptable".
When the redundancies at the two zoos were announced last week, the charity said they were part of measures to protect its "long term financial stability".
Gerard Smith, chair of trustees at the ZSEA, said Ms Roberts had worked as the chief executive officer (CEO) of the charity for four years but had made the decision to resign.
"Over recent years, the charity has survived the pandemic thanks to the efforts of the team and Claudia successfully lobbying to achieve the highest animal zoo grant funding in the country," he said.
"The charity has weathered the economic crisis and increasing energy and supply chain costs. Despite this, we have been able to maintain our high quality veterinary care, animal management and stable visitor numbers."
He added how, following the news of staff redundancies, "Claudia received widespread abuse". 
"This behaviour is wholly unacceptable, and it is, in part because of this, Claudia is resigning," he said.
"In the interest of curtailing any rumours and speculation, the board of trustees did not ask Claudia to resign, and we had full faith in her leadership of the charity. 
"However, we understand her decision and wish her well with her future endeavours."
Mr Smith said Ms Roberts would continue in the post "for the short term while recruitment takes place for a new CEO".
