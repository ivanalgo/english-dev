A fishing port, the home of the pottery industry and the birthplace of the modern co-operative movement are to be "revived" in a heritage project.
Grimsby, Stoke-on-Trent and Rochdale are among the latest eight areas to be announced as Heritage Action Zones.
Historic England will fund regeneration and conservation works once costs have been finalised in the spring. 
Revealing the sites, heritage minister John Glen said the zones would create "great places to live, work and visit".
The eight locations are:
In March, Historic England announced 10 places including Hull, Coventry and Ramsgate would receive a share of Â£6m in the first wave of funding.
The organisation's chief executive Duncan Wilson said: "Through the Heritage Action Zone scheme we want as many people as possible to feel good about the places where they live and work, and to use heritage as a catalyst to help interesting and beautiful towns and cities across England to thrive."
Work will be carried out over three to five years with local authorities and grants and training will be provided. 
The scheme is part of the Culture White Paper, a government plan which aims to build tourism, reinvigorate local areas and grow local economies.
Mr Glen, minister for Arts, Heritage and Tourism, said: "Our heritage not only tells the story of our past, it creates great places to live, work and visit. 
He said the project "is designed to make the most out of the historic environment to kick-start regeneration, increase tourism and boost investment in our towns and cities".
