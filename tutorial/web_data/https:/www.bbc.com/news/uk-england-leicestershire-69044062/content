A bus service between Melton Mowbray and Nottingham city centre is to be reinstated two years after operators said it was unviable and scrapped it.
Centrebus axed the number 19 service, which served communities between the Leicestershire town and the city, in 2022.
However, the firm has now announced it will restart buses along the route from Monday 3 June.
It said it hoped to make a commercial success of the restored service.
Centrebus said there would be four daily round trips, from Monday to Friday, stopping at Nottingham railway station.
The buses will serve Ab Kettleby, Nether Broughton, Upper Broughton, Hickling Pastures, Stanton on the Wolds, Normanton on the Wolds, Tollerton and Edwalton, the company said.
Centrebus managing director David Brookes said: "This is a great time for us to reinstate the 19 on a commercial basis, which we're sure will be a welcome addition for residents of Melton and surrounding areas.  
"I'm very much hoping we can make a success of it and potentially develop the service if enough people use it."
