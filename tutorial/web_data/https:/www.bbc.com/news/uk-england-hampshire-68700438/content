A fleet of 22 zero-emission buses will arrive on the Isle of Wight in February 2026.
Isle of Wight Council said Â£12.7m was being invested to "revolutionise" three routes operated by Southern Vectis.
The council and operator successfully bid for government funding for the vehicles.
The electric, double-decker buses will be equipped with tap-on/tap-off technology and USB chargers at every seat.
Southern Vectis said its Newport depot would also be upgraded with charging facilities. 
Managing director Andrew Wickham said: "It gives us a wonderful opportunity to make the island's transport the envy of other areas of the UK and, indeed, the world."
