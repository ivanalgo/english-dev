There are fears "someone is going to get killed" if buses continue to mount pavements on a south Wales high street.
CCTV footage shows buses mounting the kerb and driving close to the front doors of properties on East Road in Tylorstown, Rhondda Cynon Taf. 
Mother-of-two Alana Sargent said she had almost been run over stepping out of her front door.
Bus operator Stagecoach said it would launch an investigation. The council said it understood the concerns.
The street is lined with parked cars, making it difficult for larger vehicles to pass each other.
Ms Sargent said many large vehicles pull up on to the pavement and stop while other vehicles pass, but claimed Stagecoach drivers carried on driving while mounting the pavement.
"I've near enough been run over just stepping outside my front door," she said.
Her son has chronic fatigue syndrome and orthostatic intolerance, and said he was supposed to use a wheelchair while outside of the house.
"If my son did leave the house in his wheelchair, he's got to go down the step," she explained.
"By the time he's on the edge of the step where he can see, it's too late."
Ms Sargent added: "If I step out and I get run over, who's going to look after three people with underlying health conditions and disabilities?
"Who is going to come in and take on that role?"
Martin Gibbon, managing director for Stagecoach South Wales, said: "Safety is our top priority and we have since arranged to fully investigate this matter following receipt of this complaint."
A spokesperson for Rhondda Cynon Taf Council said: "We fully understand the concerns raised by the community on this matter. 
"When the council was made aware of the footage, officers raised their concerns with the bus service operator.
"Driving on the pavement and very close to properties is clearly unacceptable. 
"Any formal investigation into these incidents, as with any instance of dangerous driving, would be the role of South Wales Police."
