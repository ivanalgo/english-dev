An energy-saving trial has begun in a West Yorkshire village thanks to a local resident's lightbulb moment.
Keith Jackson, from Boston Spa, came up with the idea to use smart meter data in order to adjust energy supply levels and allow devices to work at their most efficient.
The trial could save Boston Spa and Wetherby residents an average of £28 on their annual energy bills.
Mr Jackson said participants would benefit "without having to do a thing."
The Boston Spa Energy Efficiency Trial (BEET) began in January and involves about 15,000 homes and businesses.
Mr Jackson, a retired engineer, said: "I approached Northern Powergrid with an idea that would use real-time data from smart meters to optimise network voltage levels and deliver CO2 and cost savings for the local community."
A specially developed BEET-box uses smart meter data to safely turn voltage up or down to the level that appliances need to work most efficiently. 
In turn, this could reduce bills and help homes and businesses save up to 20kg on their carbon footprint per year. 
"The BEET project is a great example of how innovative thinking can positively impact both local citizens, and our net zero goals," added Mr Jackson.
A Northern Powergrid spokesperson said household have historically received a higher voltage than most domestic appliances require to work effectively in order to comply with voltage regulations.
A national roll-out of the scheme could help the UK save up to 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 annually and cut consumer energy bills by up to £770m, the spokesperson added.
If the trial is successful, the firm plans to expand the project "across the majority" of its network of 3.9m homes and businesses by 2033.
