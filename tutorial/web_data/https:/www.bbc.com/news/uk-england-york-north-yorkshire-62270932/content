A new lifeboat named after a teenage student who drowned three years ago has been officially unveiled in York.
Sonny Ferry drowned in the River Foss after a night out in the city on 13 April 2019. 
The 19-year-old's body was found by the York Rescue Boat lifeboat crew two days later.
Mr Ferry's parents helped raise Â£45,000 for a boat called Spirit of Sonny and a naming ceremony was held in York earlier.
Kate and Steve Ferry said they were "thrilled" the craft named after their son was ready for service. 
"York's new rescue boat 'Spirit of Sonny' is tangible evidence of the empathy, generosity, determination and joyful talent of so many wonderful people," they said.
"We thank you all from the bottom of our hearts for making this a reality."
A York Rescue Boat spokesperson said the new craft was equipped with a sonar river bed mapping system, has space for a stretcher and was much safer than its predecessor.
