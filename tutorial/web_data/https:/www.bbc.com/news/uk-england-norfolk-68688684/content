A teenager who has autism has been dressing up as Spiderman to deliver Easter eggs to children over the festive period.
Charlie, 13, from South Benfleet, Essex, has always loved superheroes, especially Spiderman.
His mum Jenny gave him the idea to dress up and start delivering Easter eggs to make some extra pocket money.
Jenny said: "I am so proud of him", and added that he had thought "outside the box".
For the past two months Charlie has been delivering Easter eggs to homes locally.
But on Good Friday the Spiderman delivered 26 Easter eggs to homes in Essex.
After Easter, Charlie has planned to start delivering birthday presents as Spiderman.
His mum said: "It is not every day you see Spiderman on your doorstep."
His mum said Charlie has taken responsibility for all of the business, including taking the bookings from parents online.
Mrs Moore said: "For a non-neurotypical teenager to communicate with grown ups could have been quite difficult."
"He has always been very passionate about superheroes and for him to find a way to enjoy his interest in a way that is socially acceptable."
"I am incredibly proud of him."
She added: "He has always been unapologetically Charlie."
