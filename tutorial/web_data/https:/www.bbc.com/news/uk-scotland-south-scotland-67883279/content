A wind farm situated at what has been described as a "gateway to Scotland" has been refused. 
Community Windpower wanted to build 45 turbines along the A7 corridor between Langholm and Teviothead in Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders.
The final decision on the Faw Side project lay with the Scottish government following a public inquiry.
It has now ruled the scheme should not go ahead due to its "significant" landscape and visual impact.
There were also concerns about the effect on the nearby Eskdalemuir Seismic Array which is used to detect any vibrations caused by nuclear tests.
Both Scottish Borders Council and Dumfries and Galloway Council objected to the plans which Community Windpower said could meet the energy needs of 325,000 homes.
Of the 45 turbines which were being proposed, 13 were in the Borders with the remainder in Dumfries and Galloway.
A reporter concluded that the development would "severely compromise" the special qualities of the area.
She also found that the turbines would be "dominating and overbearing" for some nearby properties.
The reporter agreed with developers that the wind farm could have made a "valuable contribution" to meeting greenhouse gas and renewable energy targets.
However, she ruled that this did not outweigh the adverse impact of the scheme and decided the project should not proceed.
Community Windpower said the wind farm could have helped to meet national renewable energy policy objectives.
Managing director Rod Wood said: "We are obviously disappointed with this decision. However, we are taking time to review the reports and decision.
"Nonetheless, we remain committed to Scotland's renewable energy industry, businesses and supply chains."
