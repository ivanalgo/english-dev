A burst main left hundreds of homes without water for several hours and forced a number of schools to shut. 
Properties in Haxby, Wiggington, Strensall and Clifton Moor in York were affected on Thursday, with five schools closed and one only partially open.
Yorkshire Water said supplies had since been restored to all properties after the burst, but "some may experience low pressures for a short time".
Work to repair the pipe, on Wiggington Road, was continuing, it added.
City of York Council said the affected schools would reopen on Friday.
A spokesman for Yorkshire Water said: "We apologise for the inconvenience caused during the loss of supply.
"Burst pipes can happen for a number of reasons - often it's down to a change in pressure or temperature fluctuations that cause ground movement and cracks in the pipe. 
"At Yorkshire Water, we have enough pipework to wrap around the world twice. We're constantly checking them so that we can prioritise which pipes need fixing or replacing first.
"We'll continue to look closely at our network performance in the area," the spokesman added.
