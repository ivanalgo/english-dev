A 300-year-old bridge is to be closed for up to 10 weeks for repairs after it was repeatedly damaged by vehicles.
The stone crossing at Stamford Bridge in East Yorkshire will have Â£350,000 spent to strengthen it.
Rows of stone bricks on parapets on both sides of the bridge will be replaced by similar local stone, sourced from Whitby.
A council spokesperson said the work would start in May and there will be a diversion route for vehicles.
The Grade II listed structure was built in 1727 and carries the A166 over the River Derwent.
Paul West, a councillor for for East Riding of Yorkshire, said: "The bridge badly needs repairing as it's fallen victim to a number of road accidents in recent years. There's missing stonework where it's been hit and we've had to install temporary barriers. 
"Unfortunately a road closure is unavoidable in order for us to carry out this scheme, but the work we intend to do will strengthen the bridge for years to come and hopefully prevent further damage from happening. 
"We have consulted on this scheme with local parish and ward councillors and we will continue to work with them as well as local businesses and bus companies, as we know this will cause disruption for the village." 
The council spokesperson said a diversion would also include traffic lights and speed restriction on smaller local roads for the duration of the work.
A neighbouring footbridge will remain open.
