A fifth home close to a cliff edge in Norfolk has been demolished amid fears it would fall into the sea. 
Recent erosion on the coast at Hemsby has led to homes teetering on the edge and part of an access road being washed away.
The resident looked on in tears as her house was torn down. 
A 2,000-tonne consignment of granite has begun to arrive, which will be installed as a revetment defence on the shoreline.
The coastal stretch at The Marrams has been battered by high spring tides and strong winds during the last two weeks.
Demolition work by Great Yarmouth Borough Council is taking place on the north side of Hemsby Gap - a break in the dunes used by lifeboat crews to access the beach.
Another resident whose house was in danger has managed to move his home further inland. 
An emergency public meeting of residents on Friday night heard a proposal to take their case for better coastal defences to government. 
Chris Patten from Hemsby Lifeboat said a "war chest" had been started to allow them to employ a barrister who specialises in such cases.
"Government has control of the purse strings and can change policy," he said.  
Lorna Bevan, who founded the group Save Hemsby Coastline and runs The Lacon Arms pub on the coast, said there was a strong economic case to protect the village which "brings in Â£88m every single year" through tourism.
