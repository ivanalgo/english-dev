People in a Shropshire town are intrigued as to why a swan spends all day staring at its own reflection in a school window.
The bird has visited The Telford Park School every day for more than a year using a zebra crossing to get there.
After contacting a local wildlife group, school staff were told the swan was most likely widowed. 
People say the reflection could be reminding the swan of its mate. However, one man has another theory.
John Stewart, from the Wychbold Swan Rescue in Worcestershire, believes the swan may assume its reflection is a rival bird encroaching on its territory.
Mr Stewart said: "We have calls sometimes that swans are pecking aggressively at wing mirrors because they think there's another swan in their territory, that it's an intruder."
The swan is well-known in the Stirchley suburb, where the school is located, and where it is seen waddling from the Mad Brooke pool to the school gates, before returning to home after spending the day outside the building.
Billy Goodall, the school business manager at The Telford Park School, said: "I believe there's a group of swans at the pool, so maybe its not being accepted in the group."
Mr Stewart seconded this theory, suggesting that a pair of swans could be taking over the territory and trying to drive their feathery friend away.
While the swan does spend the day on its own, Mr Stewart believes that it could find another mate.
"The time of the year is crucial. It could probably fly in and take another mate. Not all swans do this, but some do," he said.
"I have known exceptions to the rule where a swan flies in, kicks the partner out, and picks a new one. That is the extreme case."
Mr Goodall described the swan as "very tame", adding that the students were very respectful of the wild bird.
Addressing its diligent use of the zebra crossing, he joked: "It's clearly got good road awareness."
