The unauthorised spa building at the home of Captain Sir Tom Moore's daughter has been demolished.
Hannah Ingram-Moore and her husband Colin had until Wednesday to remove the complex on their property in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire.
Central Bedfordshire Council initially approved plans for a building to celebrate Capt Sir Tom's legacy.
Later the authority refused revised proposals, which included a spa, after it had already been partly built.
The family lost an appeal against this decision and a deadline date of 7 February was set to remove the complex.
Planning permission was initially granted for an L-shaped building in the grounds of the family home which would host memorabilia and celebrate Capt Sir Tom's legacy.
The building was named after Capt Sir Tom, who raised Â£38m for the NHS by walking laps of his garden during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.
Revised proposals for a C-shaped building were then submitted in February 2022, which included a spa pool, toilets and a kitchen "for private use" - which Central Bedfordshire Council refused.
During the planning hearing in October, representatives for the family said the spa pool would offer "rehabilitation sessions" and the building would enable the public to enjoy the celebrated fundraiser's work.
However, planning inspector Diane Fleming said the "scale and massing" of the complex "resulted in harm" to The Old Rectory.
On 30 January scaffolders arrived at the property to begin removing the building, the spa itself was removed by crane from the building on Friday.
