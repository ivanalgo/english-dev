A police taskforce set up to combat poaching has received an accolade after reports of hare coursing more than halved over two years.
Lancashire Police's south rural taskforce covers parts of Preston, Chorley, South Ribble and West Lancashire.
It has been recognised for 'the relentless pursuit" of hare coursing.
Police and Crime Commissioner Andrew Snowden praised the team's "hard work" and "unique" policing in rural areas.
The team, set up in 2021, is part of Operation Galileo, a national operation co-ordinated by The National Wildlife Crime Unit.
The unit awarded the south rural taskforce the national certificate of recognition after reports of hare coursing across south Lancashire have reduced by 66% in the last two years.
The team has also brought about eight successful prosecutions, three criminal behaviour orders and the seizure of six vehicles and six dogs.
Victims of poaching can be subjected to fear and intimidation, property can be damaged and it often links to organised crime gangs, the force said. 
Sgt Darren Carr said: "Hare coursing and poaching is a huge issue for our rural community, with too many people living in fear of these crimes and criminals.
"We are committed to tackling this issue and we would like to thank the public for their continued support." 
Mr Snowden said: "It's great to see this recognition. The impact our rural taskforces continue to have, delivering dedicated, targeted policing that engages with rural communities and addresses their unique policing needs is testament to all their hard work."
The taskforce previously won the Rob Oliver Award in 2021 for excellence in the fight against construction plant and agricultural machinery theft after it conducting more plant machinery checks and seizures than any other force in the UK.
