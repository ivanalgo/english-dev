Happy Valley actor Rhys Connah has become an ambassador for a West Yorkshire children's hospice. 
Connah, who plays Ryan Cawood in the BBC drama, had become "firm friends" with Forget Me Not Children's Hospice in the past year, the charity said.
The charity supports children with life-shortening conditions, their families and those living with the loss of a child. 
The actor, 17, said it was "brilliant to see how well they're doing".
His connection with Forget Me Not started in March 2023 after he opened a charity shop in Hebden Bridge, where much of Happy Valley was filmed. 
He later met staff and children at its hospice in Huddersfield and ran a "forest skills day" involving building a den and creating bird feeders and bug hotels. 
Connah, who has also attended several of the charity's events, said: "I've loved spending time with the staff and volunteers and it's brilliant to see how well they're doing.
"I've been a big fan of Forget Me Not since I visited the children's hospice and saw some of the amazing work they do there to support children and families."
He added: "It's only because of the support of the whole community raising money that the charity exists at all, and that's why I'm proud to have become an official ambassador and hope to help them do more of what they do."
