Firefighters across Wales have been tackling three separate wildfires.
Crews returned to the site of a large blaze in Cwm Rheidol, Ceredigion, after it reignited on Friday. They were first called on Tuesday and a helicopter was needed to drop water.
Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service was also deployed to a grass fire near Pembrey on Friday.
Meanwhile, South Wales fire crews tackled a large blaze on Maerdy mountain in Rhondda Cynon Taff. 
At one point on Tuesday, 28 firefighters were on the scene in Cwm Rheidol and specialists in wildfires joined the battle after wind caused the flames to spread.
The helicopter unloaded 1,000 litres of water per drop - similar to what a fire engine carries in its tank - and made 20 drops an hour on Thursday.
The flames also caused the Vale of Rheidol Railway line to close.
In west Wales, crews were called to Pembrey Mountain and smoke could be seen billowing over trees.  
The fire on Maerdy mountain caused a bus service to be diverted. 
Porthmadog was once again the hottest place in the UK on Friday.
