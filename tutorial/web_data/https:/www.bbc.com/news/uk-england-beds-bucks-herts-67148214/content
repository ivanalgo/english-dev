A parish council says it fears a village will become gridlocked as a major route is set to close to allow for surface improvements.
The A6 southbound at the Clophill roundabout in Bedfordshire will shut for 10 days until Monday 30 October. 
An official diversion route during that time will take traffic through Shefford, Hitchin and Luton. 
But Silsoe Parish Council believes the village will be "overrun" and is calling for 20mph speed limits. 
Central Bedfordshire Council said "mitigation measures" will be in place to deter drivers going through Silsoe.
It said there will be "no through route through Silsoe, apart from access for residents, businesses, and visitors to Wrest Park".
The official diversion route will be in force between 08:00 BST on Friday and 20:00 on Monday 30 October. 
The parish council has been told a reduced speed limit an the closure of smaller roads would not be possible due to a lack of resources. 
Peter Offer, vice chairman of the council, said: "Essentially they've turned around to us and said we can't be held responsible for people's sat-navs and local knowledge.
"We're very concerned about the safety measures." 
He said he believed the village would become "gridlocked" by the increased traffic. 
"The village is not happy, and we are doing our best as a parish council to keep everybody informed," he said.
A spokeswoman for the council said the closure was needed for "extensive works will be carried out at Old Silsoe Road junction". 
"We are mindful that drivers familiar with the area will use Silsoe and other villages as an alternative to the diversion route and therefore a package of mitigation measures to deter drivers from doing so will also be in place for the duration of the closure," she said.
