A lemur has been moved to a wildlife park in Devon to keep another animal company and for potential breeding.
Combe Martin Wildlife and Dinosaur Park welcomed two-year old Eleven, or El, on 26 January - about five months after Storm the lemur died, aged 27. 
Louisa Bartlett, head keeper at the park, said it had taken "a few days" for El to warm to Felix, the remaining lemur.
She added the pair now spent "all their time together". 
El travelled from Blair Drummond Safari Park.
"Being a social animal Felix needed a new friend," Ms Bartlett said.
She said El moved to the park as part of a management programme for the captive breeding of the species to ensure the "gene pool stays strong". 
Ms Bartlett said the co-ordinator, who monitors and regulates all the black and white ruffed lemurs in Europe, recommended El to be transferred to the park "for company and potentially breeding" in the future.
"It wasn't an instant attraction, well not on El's part as it took her a few days to warm to Felix," Ms Bartlett said. 
She added the two lemurs had since been basking in the sun together.
