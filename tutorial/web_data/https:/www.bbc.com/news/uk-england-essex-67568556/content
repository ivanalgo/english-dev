Dozens of memorial plaques have been stolen or vandalised at a cemetery, leaving relatives "heartbroken".
The vandalism took place in the Memorial Garden at Woodside Cemetery in Benfleet, Essex.
Jane Jefferis, who had plaques stolen from her relatives' memorials, said: "How could somebody stoop so low as to take the plaques from a cemetery?"
Castle Point Borough Council said the stolen plaques would be replaced free of charge.
Ms Jefferis told the BBC she believed there were between 50 to 60 plaques in each of the memorial garden's five flower beds.
"Each flower bed only had about 10 plaques left," she said.
"To come and put flowers up here when it was my dad's birthday was really difficult without the plaque."
Andy Ransom, originally from Benfleet, said he was upset when he heard that three of his relatives' plaques had been taken. 
"For some people, this plaque is all they've got left of their relative," he said.
"It's a bit upsetting to know they've gone, but more annoyed that someone's stolen them for scrap metal."
The BBC has learned that nearly 50 plaques were found behind a tree in the cemetery, and are available for people to check if their relatives' is there, but dozens are still missing.
Michael Fuller, portfolio holder for environment at the council, said: "It is regretful that the behaviour of certain mindless individuals, who have vandalised memorial plaques... has caused such distress to relatives." 
Mr Fuller added that any stolen plaques which are not recovered would be replaced for no charge.
