One hundred people have been fatally stabbed in the UK so far this year. 
The first death was 33-year-old mother Charlotte Huggins, who died in London just a few hours after celebrating the start of the new year.
The 100th death was John Lewis, 32, who died in Middlesbrough on the evening of 14 May. 
Those killed in 2019 range in age from 14-year-old Jaden Moodie, who was stabbed in Leyton, east London in January - to 80-year-old Barbara Heywood, who was attacked at her home in Bolton in March.  
Almost half of the victims were under 30 and were overwhelmingly male.  
Knife crime in England and Wales rose to record levels in 2017-18 with the number of fatal stabbings the highest since Home Office records began in 1946. 
There has been one fatal stabbing every 1.45 days so far this year in England and Wales.  If killings continued at that rate for the rest of the year, the total would be slightly lower than the 285 stabbing deaths recorded in 2017-18.
Thirty of the fatal stabbings were in London, 10 in Greater Manchester and eight in the West Midlands. 
The police have made arrests in nearly all of the cases and have charged suspects in 86. 
Below are the details and, where available, photos of those who have lost their lives so far this year.

Analysis by Reality Check
The number of people being taken to court for possessing a weapon has been rising. 
There's a bit of a time lag when it comes to getting figures from the criminal justice system, so the latest ones we have, published on Thursday, only take us up to the end of last year. 
In 2018, the Ministry of Justice recorded 21,587 cases of people in England Wales being prosecuted for possessing a weapon, of which 13,350 cases led to a conviction - compared with 17,669 cases in 2013 - with 10,026 leading to a conviction. 
This was mostly driven by a rise in the offence of "having possession of a bladed article in a public place". 
For adults, the maximum sentence for possessing a knife is four years. 
Knife possession is now making up a bigger share of all weapons offences - two-thirds compared with half 10 years ago. 
And a bigger proportion of knife and weapons possession offences now result in jail time - 36% compared with 20% in 2008. 
These figures cover both adults and children aged 10-17. For adults only, 42% of weapons offences resulted in an immediate custodial sentence last year.  
While knife possession offences have been rising since 2013, they are still lower than a decade ago.
