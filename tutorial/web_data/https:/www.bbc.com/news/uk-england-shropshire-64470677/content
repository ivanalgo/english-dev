Firefighters have brought a large hillside fire in Shropshire under control.
Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service was called to the Shropshire Hills, near Church Stretton, at about 17:00 GMT.
It said the blaze involved an area of gorse plant that measured about 300 to 400 sq m.
Firefighter Lee Baker said access and the steep hillside leading up to the scene had made it difficult to deal with the fire.
In a tweet, he said the fire had been surrounded and work to extinguish it continued.
By 20:30, the fire service said the blaze was "just about under control now with some tired firefighters fighting the fire on the hillside up Cwmdale Valley". 
Fire crews are in attendance from Baschurch, Church Stretton, Craven Arms, Shrewsbury and Telford Central.
