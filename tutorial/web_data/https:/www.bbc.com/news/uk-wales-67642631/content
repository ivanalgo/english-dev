Heavy rainfall has hit south Wales after the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning. 
The alert came into force at midnight and lasts until 18:00 GMT on Thursday.
Some areas will experience up to 80mm (3.1 in) of rainfall, with at least 30 to 40mm (1.2 to 1.6 in) expected across the region. 
The forecaster said some flooding was expected, as well as possible power cuts and difficult driving conditions. 
The warning covers Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Swansea, Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan.
Rainfall accumulation is likely to be highest over the Brecon Beacons, according to BBC Wales weather presenter Sabrina Lee. 
The Pembrokeshire-Carmarthenshire border area, Neath Port Talbot and Rhondda Cynon Taf will also be particularly affected, she added.  
Cardiff council said teams were working to clear the gullies in areas of the city which are prone to surface waste flooding, but added there were 80,000 gullies across the city.
"If you have a drain cover on your property or on the pavement outside your property, please help us by removing any leaves that may be on top of the drain cover," it said.
