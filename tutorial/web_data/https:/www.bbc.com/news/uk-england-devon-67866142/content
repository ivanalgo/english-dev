Rangers working on Dartmoor are set to carry on using body-worn video cameras while out on patrol.
The move is in response to anti-social and hostile behaviour by some visitors.
A two-year trial of the cameras which began in February 2022 has been hailed a success, with rangers saying they feel safer as a result.
Now members of the Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA) are poised to give the go-ahead for the cameras to stay in use.
The pilot was set up to see if using cameras would help address incidents of abuse as well as helping rangers to enforce the law on the moor.
The head ranger's report to the DNPA said the cameras had been activated seven times during the pilot.
It detailed how in one incident, a ranger was able to use footage to dispute a claim he had knocked down a member of the public with his vehicle at Buckland Bridge.
"Overall the team feel safer having them available and support their continued use," the report said.
"The presence of body-worn cameras has not met with any notable objections from the public or had any noticeable negative impact on conversations.
"The presence of a camera during the confrontation at Buckland Bridge shows how well it can protect the team from false allegations."
The Local Democracy Reporting Service said the total cost for the two-year pilot period was just over Â£8,000.
A recommendation that the use of body-worn cameras by rangers should continue, will be put to DNPA members on 5 January.
