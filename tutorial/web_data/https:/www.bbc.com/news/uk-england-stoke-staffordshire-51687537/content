Drayton Manor Theme Park has reopened after it was forced to close due to severe flooding.
The lake inside the attraction burst its banks following heavy rain from Storm Dennis on 16 February, requiring them to close for a clean-up.
The park, in Tamworth, initially shut for three days but said it would need to close until 29 February.
"Thankfully, all 532 of our animals are safe and well", the park tweeted during the closure.
