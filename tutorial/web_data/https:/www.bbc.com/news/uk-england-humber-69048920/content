A breastfeeding trail has been launched in Hull to "ensure breastfeeding-friendly spots are easy to identify", the city council said.
Users can pick up a map showing nine locations in the city centre.
Each venue has a quiz question and participants can get a sticker when they finish the trail.
Councillor Linda Chambers said: "We want everyone who chooses to breastfeed to feel supported and comfortable when they're out and about in Hull".
She said: "Historically, we've had lower breastfeeding rates in Hull.
"One of the ways to challenge that is to create an atmosphere where expectant and new mums feel comfortable feeding in public and breastfeeding is normalised. 
"Educating about it, and proudly increasing awareness are an important part of that process, which is why the trail will be such a vital asset."
Venues on the list include Hull Minster, Ferens Art Gallery and Princes Quay shopping centre.
They are part of a wider network of 120 breastfeeding friendly venues throughout the city.
The trail has been developed in conjunction with the Humber NHS Foundation Trust.
Ellie Talbot-Imber, infant feeding lead at the trust, said: "The milk trail is a fun and free activity for all families, to come and see some iconic venues in Hull city centre, whilst finding out some amazing facts about breastfeeding.
"We want to raise the profile of breastfeeding and show everyone that not only is breastfeeding increasing in Hull, it is both encouraged and very much supported".
