Power has been restored to homes across the South East after Storm Franklin, UK Power Networks says.
Earlier the supplier said 18 homes in East Sussex and about 50 homes in Kent were still without electricity after losing power during Monday's storm. 
It added that outages displayed on its online map were power cuts that had occurred since the recent storms. 
South East Water said water supplies had been restored to all customers. 
In its statement UK Power Networks said: "Engineers have now restored power to properties affected by both Storm Eunice and Storm Franklin. This is with the exception of isolated cases where final repairs are being completed or we cannot gain access to customer properties." 
It added: "We understand the difficulty and disruption events like this cause to people's everyday lives in the communities we serve, and appreciate the impact that having no power for a prolonged period has had." 
Thousands of homes across Kent, Sussex and Surrey had been left without power, and some without water too, following Storm Eunice last Friday and Storm Franklin just two days later. 
Some had been without electricity for up to six days before power was restored. 
South East Water also said pockets of disruption across the South East may still exist.  
Douglas Whitfield, South East Water's director of operations, said: "All customers who were without water as a result of Storm Eunice and Storm Franklin have now had their drinking water supplies restored.
"If customers are still without water this will be extremely localised and likely caused by airlocks, therefore we urge them to get in contact with us as soon as possible so we can investigate."
