Flood defences in a north Wales village were not fully utilised before homes were left ankle-deep in water, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has said. 
The fire service and a farmer's tractor were used to rescue people from their homes in Trevalyn, near Wrexham, on Sunday morning. 
Residents claimed a slatted barrier and pump, usually used before water levels rise, were not employed. 
NRW said it was investigating why the defences were not fully used. 
Operations manager Iwan Williams said his team had worked all weekend to try and reduce the effects of the extreme weather. 
He said: "We're currently looking into how and why our assets were not utilised fully to reduce the effects of the extreme weather."
North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said flood waters were waist-deep in one house on Almere Ferry Road, while several others were ankle-deep in water. 
The nearby River Alyn has seen record water levels since Storm Babet first hit early on Friday.
In England, residents of some 500 homes in a Nottinghamshire town have been urged to evacuate due to flooding and record river levels.
NRW had warned it could take some time before water from upper catchment areas reached flood plains.
In Wales, one flood warning still remains, covering the River Dee at Almere, Erbistock, Plas Devon and Trevalyn Meadows, near Wrexham.
The land around Trevalyn is 7m (23ft) above sea level and is known to be at risk of flooding.
On Sunday morning, NRW lifted a severe flood warning covering Llandrinio in Powys where the rivers Severn and Vyrnwy meet.
Rail operator Transport for Wales said service disruption was expected to continue throughout Sunday following disruption caused by flooding.
