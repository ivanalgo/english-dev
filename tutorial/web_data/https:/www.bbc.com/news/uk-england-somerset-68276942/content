Four cycle route crossings on the outskirts of Bristol are to be upgraded. 
The Festival Way, in North Somerset, is used for more than 1,600 leisure and commuter trips per day on either bike or foot.
The crossings - at Station Road in Flax Bourton, Backwell Bow in Backwell, and Lodge Lane and Trendlewood Way in Nailsea - will get a lower speed limit.
There will also be improved signage at each crossing.
The work will begin later in the month.
Hannah Young, North Somerset Council's executive member with responsibility for active travel said: "These changes will further enhance the route and increase safety. 
"Unfortunately it won't be possible to leave the path open during the improvement, but the length of the works will be minimised to reduce disruption.
"We would ask people to be patient while the improvements are completed."
