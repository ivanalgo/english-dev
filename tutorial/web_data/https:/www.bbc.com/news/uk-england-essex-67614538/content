A two-year-old fundraising superhero has managed to raise Â£1,800 throughout his lifetime by taking part in various charity events, including a triathlon.
Arlo, from Colchester, was five months old when he was diagnosed with bilateral cataracts.
He runs alongside his family at events to raise money for Variety children's charity. 
Arlo often "steals the show" at the fundraisers and keeps spirits high by waving at the crowds, his mother said.
With glasses, Arlo is only able to see up to two-and-a-half metres (8ft) in front of him and he was born without peripheral vision.
His mother, Amber Fox-Hammond, said: "He's been a real trooper."
"When you see that your child isn't developing at the same rate as other children around you, you just know that something is wrong, and for it to take five months to be listened to was particularly challenging," she said.
However, she said her "determined" son was taking it all in his stride.
"He's developing well now," she said. "He does not let the visual impairment stop him."
As Arlo gets older, doctors may be able to carry out an operation to implant artificial lenses, or they may decide to prescribe stronger glasses.
