People in a Suffolk village are urging the new owners of a historic local pub to reopen its doors. 
The Queen in Brandeston, near Framlingham, has been closed since November 2022, despite getting new owners earlier this year. 
Residents say they are "disappointed" it has not reopened, especially as it is the village's only pub.
The parish council said the new owners have not indicated to them when they intend to open. 
According to a survey by the Suffolk Heritage Explorer from Suffolk County Council, a pub was first built on the site in 1447 - then named The Queens Head.
The building's roof was destroyed in a fire around the turn of the 19th Century and was rebuilt in 1956, researchers said.
In 2022, it was put on the market for about Â£500,000, with the advert stating the premises featured an in-house shop, three private bedrooms and space for 50 diners.
Residents say the new owners have not revealed any plans to reopen it and many fear it will remain closed.
Janet Baxter told BBC Radio Suffolk: "When people in the village asked them when it's going to open, they've skirted around it... I don't think it'll ever be open as a pub again." 
"We're all very disappointed that it's gone," added local resident Darryl Morgan. 
Mr Morgan, his wife, Pat, and villager Helen Fletcher opened a once-a-month pop-up pub in the village hall in January.
 "We see people that we don't normally see. It's absolutely brilliant for the community," he said.
"We thought we'd only be running the pop-up until August but here we are."
East Suffolk Council said that premises licence holders could surrender their licences at any time, but would not comment further in relation to The Queen.
The owners of the pub were approached for comment.
