A man is appealing for help to find a randy goose that has gone on the loose. 
Richard Collins, from Hoxne in Suffolk, said Larry, a greylag goose, went missing on Tuesday. 
It is the second time he has wandered off since Christmas and his owner suspects that, having failed to impress two female geese that live with him, he may have spread his wings in his search of a new bird to mate with.
Mr Collins said: "I think he's gone off looking for love elsewhere."
Larry came to Mr Collins after being found further east in the Waveney valley - walking through the streets of Beccles when he was a gosling.
He is mostly grey, with white on the tips of his wings, a yellow beak and pink feet. 
"He's very friendly. He does answer to his name, so if you call 'Larry' and he looks up, then that's definitely our Larry," said Mr Collins.
The goose also disappeared three weeks ago, but with the help of social media, was found five nights later in a paddock down the road. 
Mr Collins has now appealed on social media once again, and is asking people to spread the message "far and wide".
"If he's gone out and found himself a flock, or found himself a mate, then we're very happy for him, but if he's out there alone, we'd like him back because we love him," he said.
