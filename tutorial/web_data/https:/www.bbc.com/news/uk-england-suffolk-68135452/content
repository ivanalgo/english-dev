A woman promoted from a brewing company's cleaner to its chief operating officer is to retire.
Dr Karen Hester will leave Adnams, of Southwold, Suffolk, in April after 36 years.
She said she wanted to "embrace other passions" and spend more time with her family.
"I've had such a wonderful career at Adnams and could never have imagined where this journey would have taken me," she said.
The award-winning businesswoman, who has been recognised for Adnams' success in supporting female employees to reach their full potential, thanked her team for "their support, loyalty, friendship and commitment".
"When I look back at joining the business as a cleaner in 1988 [and] being the first female executive director in the company's 150-year-old history, I am extremely proud to have been a board member of Adnams for nearly a decade," she said.
"Alongside that, many will know I had an entirely unexpected health diagnosis, which, whilst I have beaten [it], was life-changing and certainly puts life into perspective."
She said he was proud of what had been achieved at Adnams but added: "Now feels like the right time for me to take a step back. I am looking forward to my next chapter."
She said she would continue in her roles as a magistrate and non-executive chair of an organisation called Independence Matters. 
Adnams chief executive officer Andy Wood praised her service and said it was "impossible to overstate what an asset" she had been.
"She has worked in so many aspects of our business, and in every area she has managed to lead, advise, motivate and enthuse people," he said.
"We are really privileged to have been alongside her and can only wish her every happiness and success within her retirement."
