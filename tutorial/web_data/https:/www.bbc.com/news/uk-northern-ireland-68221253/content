Stormont's Department for Infrastructure is moving its headquarters from Belfast city centre into the city's Gasworks business park.
It is due to relocate from Clarence Court on Adelaide Street to James House later this year.
Both buildings are owned by the Northern Ireland Executive and Clarence Court has now been put up for sale.
The large office building is being advertised as having "repurposing and redevelopment potential".
It is an eight-storey development which includes a 261 space multi-storey car park.
The Northern Ireland Civil Service is understood to be reviewing its office space requirements in light of increased working from home.
Some staff from the Department of Agriculture have relocated from Dundonald House on the Stormont estate to the Department of Finance's HQ at Clare House.
