A new art exhibition is showcasing David Bowie's close friendship with a local photographer.
Geoff MacCormack is displaying photographs taken while he was touring with the music star in an exhibition on show in Nailsworth.
Mr MacCormack grew up with Mr Bowie in Bromley, London, and toured with him in the 1970s.
"It's just a lovely way to remember him and his popularity never seems to wane. So the legacy carries on," he said.
The exhibition opens at the Form Gallery on Market Street on 17 November and is open until 6 January 2024.
Mr MacCormack met Mr Bowie, then David Jones, when the pair were eight years old at a primary school in Bromley, south-east London.
Mr MacCormack said: "He was always David Jones to me and everything else was showbiz.
"He was always the same really.
"He was very funny, he was very silly, in fact. (He had a) silly sense of humour. 
"Humour was a lot of the strength of our relationship."
Mr MacCormack said photography started off as a hobby for him, which happened to come during the time he was on tour with Mr Bowie.
"It was a period where David looked fantastic and I'm so glad I had (a camera) for those three years on the road, because I thought he looked great," he added.
One of the most influential musicians of his era, BDavid Bowie died of cancer at the age of 69 in January 2016
"I knew he had heart problems but I didn't know he had a terminal illness," said Mr MacCormack
"Having these images is really helpful because he remains there and people love the images," he added.
