People are being urged to avoid water-based activities after forecasters warned of more heavy rain and dozens of flood alerts were issued for rivers.
Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it had attended several water and flood-related incidents in the past weeks.
It warned of strong currents and cold-water shock, and said people should also avoid popular water beauty spots.
In Wales one flood warning and more than 20 alerts were in place.
The flood warning is in place for the River Vyrnwy at Llanymynech, Powys, which was recorded at 4m (13ft) on Tuesday. 
Natural Resources Wales said the river could hit between 4.3m and 4.65m on Tuesday evening.
Heavy rain was expected to cause disruption across large parts of the country, with the Met Office saying the heaviest rain was expected over higher ground, with up to 10cm (3.9in) possible in parts.
The weather warning covered 19 of Wales' 22 counties and is in effect until 20:00 GMT on Tuesday, with another issued late on Monday affecting south-west Wales until 10:00.
The fire service said people walking near water should also keep dogs on leads, time their walks to make the most of daylight and always keep back from the edge.
It also warned drivers never to enter flooded roads as the water can often be deeper and faster-flowing than they may realise.
The Met Office weather warnings coveed Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Swansea, Vale of Glamorgan, Torfaen and Wrexham.
The Met Office said some homes and businesses could be flooded and travel disrupted.
"Outbreaks of rain will spread across England and Wales during Tuesday. This will be heaviest and most persistent across parts of Wales, particularly over higher ground," it warned.
