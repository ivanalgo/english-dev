World-famous designers and labels, from Dame Vivienne Westwood to Stella McCartney, are being displayed in a historic residence.
Each brand has taken over one of the rooms at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire for The Icons of British Fashion exhibition.
Many fashion shows, photoshoots and catwalks have been hosted at the 300-year-old building in the past, with some attended by royalty.
The exhibition runs until 30 June.
Fashion from the past through to the present day is being celebrated, with bespoke designs and loans from some famous industry names.
Each space along the visitor route will pay homage to a British fashion icon.
In the Great Hall, designs by the late Dame Vivienne Westwood and creative partner Andreas Kronthaler will be showcased.
Pieces from brands such as Christian Dior and Barbour will also be on show.
Kate Ballenger, keeper of palace and collections, said hosting the exhibition had been years in the making.
"We are privileged to collaborate with such incredible British designers and celebrate the creativity within the UK's fashion industry.
"Our palace is the perfect backdrop to showcase the lasting impact of British fashion on the global stage over the years," she added.
