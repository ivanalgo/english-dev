In the early hours of Tuesday, the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore collapsed into the Patapsco River after a container ship crashed into it.
Dramatic pictures show the full scale of the collapse.
A huge search operation is under way for at least seven people, authorities say, while two people have been pulled from the water.
Sonar has detected multiple vehicles underwater, where the temperature is around 8C (47F).
The ship is now wedged into debris from the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which is 3km (1.6 miles) long and part of a major highway.
Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul J Wiedefeld gave a press conference, saying that there were contractors working on the bridge at the time of the collapse, repairing the concrete surface.
He added that all shipping traffic in and out of the Port of Baltimore has been suspended as the search and rescue mission continues.
