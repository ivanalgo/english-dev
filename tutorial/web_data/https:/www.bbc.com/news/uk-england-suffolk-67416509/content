An MP has stood down from his role as parliamentary private secretary (PPS) over his support for Suella Braverman, who was sacked from government.
Ipswich MP Tom Hunt had been a PPS to the Northern Ireland secretary for 14 months, currently Chris Heaton-Harris. 
Mr Hunt, Conservative, said: "It was my intention for a few months to stand down at the reshuffle.
"The situation with Suella Braverman did, however, bring the issue to a head."
He continued: "I don't think she should have been sacked and I signed a letter supporting her knowing that this would be incompatible with my role as a PPS.
"I informed the whips of this and have left my role."
Suella Braverman was sacked as home secretary after she defied No 10 over an article accusing the Metropolitan Police of bias in the policing of protests.
She was accused of stoking tension ahead of events in London.
James Cleverly has replaced her at the Home Office.
Tom Hunt said he wanted to focus on constituency work in Ipswich and holding the government to account.
"A key focus for me will be pushing the government hard to do whatever is necessary to tackle the small boats crisis and also cutting the level of net legal migration."
