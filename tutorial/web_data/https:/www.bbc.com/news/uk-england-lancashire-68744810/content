The University of Central Lancashire is to slash 165 jobs in a bid to save money.
About 5% of the 3,300 staff will go as the Preston university looks to "reshape the way it delivers world-leading education and research".
The University & College Union said it was "disappointed".
Vice-chancellor, professor Graham Baldwin, said the higher education sector is "facing unprecedented financial challenges".
He said: "At a time when income is static and our expenditure is growing, we need to start reducing our costs as well as balancing developing areas of growth and investing in areas that attract students to study with us.
"Whilst it is important that we reduce our costs and our staff base over the coming months, it is also important to remember that we remain a strong performing university delivering quality teaching to thousands of students.  
"As ever our continued priority is our students and giving them a great university experience."
The university has launched a voluntary redundancy scheme for academic and professional services employees.
Matt Arrowsmith, the union's north west regional official, said: "We expect management to keep to their commitment to avoid any compulsory redundancies. 
"We will consult with management on this basis, but should their commitment waiver, UCU members stand ready to fight to defend every single job."
