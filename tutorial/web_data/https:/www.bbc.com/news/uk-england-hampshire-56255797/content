The Isle of Wight Festival will go ahead in September, its organisers have said.
Lionel Richie, Snow Patrol and Duran Duran were due to appear at the 2020 event at Seaclose Park, Newport, but it was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The festival was originally rescheduled for June, but will now take place from 16 to 19 September.
Organisers said they were in the process of rebooking artists.
In a statement the festival said: "We're aiming to bring back as many of the artists as we can but whatever happens, rest assured, you'll enjoy a stellar line-up over the festival weekend."
The previously announced line-up also included The Script, Jess Glynne and Carly Rae Jepsen.
Isle of Wight Council leader Dave Stewart said it would not have been safe to hold the event in June..
He said: "Although it is likely we will be out of lockdown and 'open for business' as an Island in September, this is not definite.
"Any plans must be predicated on it being safe for the festival to proceed, which will ultimately be a decision based on public health grounds."
Festival organisers said existing tickets would be valid for September and people who could not make the new dates should contact their ticket providers for a refund.
