Three men who died after a 4x4 vehicle was "swept away" as it tried to cross a river have been identified.
Scott Thomas Daddy, 28, from Hull, Leslie Forbes, 70, from East Yorkshire, and Kenneth Patrick Hibbins, 59, known as Patrick, from York, died in the River Esk near Glaisdale on Thursday.
Friends and family have paid tribute to the men via North Yorkshire Police.
Police said another man, who tried to help the trapped men, was pulled from the river and needed medical treatment.
Mr Daddy was a "passionate" Hull FC supporter and enjoyed 4x4s and outdoor activities, his family said.
"He was taken suddenly doing something he enjoyed, but too early," they said.
Mr Forbes' family said he was a "loving husband, father and grandfather, who will be sadly missed by his family and friends".
Mr Hibbins "will be sadly missed by all his close friends and work colleagues", the police tribute said.
Chris Ford, who lives nearby, said the men were part of an off-roading group when they attempted to cross a ford on Rake Lane.
The river, swollen by heavy rain, swept them away and carried them about 400 yards (366m) downstream where Mr Ford later found the car fully submerged in water, he said.
The incident came as Storm Gerrit caused flooding and travel disruption across the country throughout Wednesday and Thursday.
