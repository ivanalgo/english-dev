A BBC documentary about the murder of Sarah Everard by a police officer will examine the impact of the case on the Metropolitan Police Force.
Ms Everard was 33 when she was abducted, raped and murdered in what the film makers call "a watershed moment" for the nation.
The Met was placed in special measures and a culture was uncovered of bullying, discrimination, homophobia, misogyny and racism.  
The repercussions are still being felt.
The documentary also looks at how police forces across the country were forced to confront the "devastating issues" within police forces and the culture and behaviour in their own ranks.
Contributors to the programme include the senior investigating officer and the barrister who prosecuted the case. 
The film makers said they were in contact with Ms Everard's family, "who hope that it will bring increased focus to issues of women's safety, and abuse of power by police and other in positions of authority."
Sarah Everard: The Search For Justice will be on BBC One and iPlayer.
