A cat has died after it was shot with an air rifle and attacked by dogs, police have said.
Officers were called to Nugent Close in Church Crookham, near Fleet, Hampshire, after reports the animal was killed between 00:01 and 01:30 BST on Monday. 
Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary said three men and three dogs were seen in the area at the time of the incident.
The force is appealing for witnesses and information. 
All three men were wearing camouflage clothing and believed to be in their late teens to early 20s, it added. 
Two of the dogs were described as looking like lurchers or greyhound-type dogs, while the other dog looked like a Staffordshire bull terrier, with a white chest and paw.
Sgt Geoff Hill said: "We know this incident will be concerning for the local community, however please be reassured that we are working hard to establish the exact circumstances of what took place.
"Officers are carrying out extensive inquiries in the local area. If you have any concerns or information, please don't hesitate to speak to our officers and please get in touch if you have any information which may help with the investigation."
