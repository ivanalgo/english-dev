A man has died more than three months after a fire at a defence pyrotechnics factory.
The 19-year-old was taken to hospital after the blaze at the PW Defence factory in Draycott, Derbyshire, on the evening of 20 January.
He died on Thursday, Derbyshire Police confirmed.
The fire saw two men taken to hospital, with several emergency service vehicles, a hazardous area response team and the air ambulance attending.
The site - in Wilne Road - was bought by Wescom Defence, based in Havant, Hampshire, in February 2021.
The Wescom website says the company provides "specialist pyrotechnics for signalling, illumination, screening and for battlefield training and simulation, obstacle clearance systems and civil defence and security".
The products made at the site and the cause of the fire are not yet known, but the PA news agency understands the death is linked to the fire.
A Wescom Defence spokesperson said: "We have sent our deepest condolences to their family and friends and to all the members of our team, who share in our grief and we will continue to support them.
"We ask that you respect the privacy of those affected and our thoughts remain with the bereaved, their family and friends."
Derbyshire Police added officers had been working with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which confirmed it is investigating alongside police.
