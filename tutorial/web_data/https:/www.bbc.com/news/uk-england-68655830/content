A doctor has pleaded with families to "resist the urge" to eat an entire Easter egg in one go during this weekend's celebrations.
Dr Andrew Kelso, a senior doctor for the NHS in Suffolk and Essex, said people should not "overdo it" when enjoying a chocolate treat.
He warned many GP surgeries would be closed over the Easter weekend and said hospitals would face more pressure. 
"I urge people to enjoy their Easter eggs in moderation," Dr Kelso said.
Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday, which falls on 31 March this year.
The tradition of eating and gifting chocolate at Easter dates back to centuries ago when Christians began exchanging eggs as symbols of rebirth.
Dr Kelso, medical director at the NHS Suffolk and North East Essex Integrated Care Board, said many people did not realise the amount of calories there were in Easter eggs.
"At a time like this when we are seeing significant increases in cases of obesity and Type 2 diabetes, as well as tooth decay, I urge people to enjoy their Easter eggs in moderation and resist the urge to eat a whole egg in one go," he said.
"As well as Easter eggs, many of us will be meeting up with family and friends for social occasions which will see us eat more cakes and biscuits. 
"Combined, it all adds up to a lot of extra sugar and calories, which doesn't do our bodies any good. Enjoy your sweet treats, but please don't overdo it."
