A dangerous motorist who drove straight at a police car in a bid to escape has been jailed for almost two years.
Monsur Miah was banned from driving when officers saw him in an Audi in the early hours of 3 February 2022, Newcastle Crown Court heard.
Miah, 29, drove straight at the officers, hitting their car and a parked vehicle before driving away.
He was found guilty after trial of dangerous driving and driving while disqualified and without insurance.
The court heard Miah, of St Jude's Terrace in South Shields, was banned from driving, having previously served a jail term for dangerous driving.
Two officers in a marked police car recognised him when they saw him driving the Audi on Cleveland Court in South Shields at about 01:00 GMT.
Miah drove away, turned to face the police car then headed straight for the officers.
He caused scuffs and dents to the police car and to a parked vehicle but no-one was injured, Judge Sarah Mallett said.
She said he had previously driven dangerously to flee from police, with other previous convictions involving drugs, weapons and public order offences.
He was found guilty of the latest crimes at trial and had been due to be sentenced in June 2023, but he did not show up for court.
Miah was jailed for 20 months for the driving offences and a further three months for failing to appear at the June hearing.
He was also banned from driving for three years and five-and-a-half months, and must take an extended test to regain his licence.
