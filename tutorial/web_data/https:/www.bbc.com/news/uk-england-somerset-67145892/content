A stretch of the Mendip Hills in Somerset is to be known as a "super" National Nature Reserve to help boost biodiversity in the area.
It will join up 31 existing nature reserves in the section between Wells and Weston-super-Mare to help preserve wildlife.
Tony Juniper, Chair of Natural England, said: "This will enhance the biodiversity of the Mendip Hills."
"This will make it a better place for wildlife to thrive."
He continued: "This treasure trove of ancient woodlands, rich wildflower grasslands and stunning geology is of great national importance and sustains a huge variety of wildlife.
"There are birds, small mammals, rare butterflies and plants that are found only here and we want to preserve that."
The Mendip Hills stretches 19 miles across Somerset and is already an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
This will support the maintenance along the popular walking route of the Mendip Way and will see nine organisations working together to support the hills wildlife and geology.
It will help protect species such as skylark, black oil beetle, hazel dormouse and the endemic Cheddar pink flower.
The site is the second in the new King's Series of National Nature Reserves to celebrate the Coronation of His Majesty King Charles III. 
Jim Hardcastle, manager of Mendip Hills AONB, said: "This declaration publicly recognises how special the wildlife sites are on the south facing slopes of the Mendip Hills. 
"The new National Nature Reserve will show how all the land managers can work together to help nature recover with the involvement of locals and visitors."
