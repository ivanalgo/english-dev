A councillor urged colleagues to fight "to the very end" against plans for a new waste-to-energy incinerator.
MVV Environment wants to build the plant in Wisbech, near the Cambridgeshire-Norfolk border.
It was approved by the government but the decision was later removed from the Planning Inspectorate website pending "clarification".
Fenland District Council has agreed to investigate the option of challenging the plans at a judicial review. 
Steve Tierney, a conservative councillor for Wisbech South, instigated a vote for a judicial review and pledged £1,000 of his own cash towards paying for the action, if it went ahead.
Mr Tierney told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) the council "owe it to the people of Fenland" to "fight this to the very end" adding "we could still win; this isn't over yet". 
Council leader Chris Boden supported Mr Tierney's vote but urged colleagues to be "realistic".
The secretary of state's decision will only be overturned if a significant error in the process can be found.
A judicial review could cost hundreds of thousands of pounds and take several months to complete.
The council said it hoped other authorities would help fund the legal action, claiming the proposed incinerator would have an impact on roads and other services. 
The incinerator would burn half a million tonnes of household waste each year, converting it into energy. 
Medworth CHP Ltd previously said it would be a "good neighbour", providing steam and electricity to surrounding homes and businesses. 
Fenland District Council has six weeks to decide whether to bring a judicial review.
