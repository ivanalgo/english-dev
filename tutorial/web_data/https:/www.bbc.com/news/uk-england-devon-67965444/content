A community has launched its own composting group to help get rid of green waste, said South Hams District Council.
Marldon Community Composting Group has been handed Â£9,000 by the council after its bid reflected its vision to "fight climate change locally". 
The council said its own grounds maintenance team could assist with "turning and shredding".
Councillor Jacqi Hodgson said: "Schemes like this are a win-win."
Ms Hodgson, executive member for community composting, said: "They offer communities the chance to recycle green waste in a way that is easy to access and take locally produced compost home for their gardens. 
"It also brings people together, promotes the sharing of vital skills and helps reduce our carbon footprint."
The group was helped in their bid by Sustainable South Hams, which the council said it hoped would support more composting projects.
