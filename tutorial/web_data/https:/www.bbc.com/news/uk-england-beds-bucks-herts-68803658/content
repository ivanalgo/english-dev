A family who said bowls had helped them through grief has praised fundraising efforts for the sport. 
The Watford and District Bowling Association (WDBA) organised a charity match against Disability Bowls England (DBE), which raised Â£2,000.
Dave, 51, whose wife died after an asthma attack, said bowls had been good for his son who has mild cerebral palsy and a learning disability.
He said the match showed the sport's "inclusivity".
The father-of-three, from Hatfield, was taught to play bowls by his dad and passed his love for the sport to his sons Jake, 12, Thomas, 13, and Dylan, 16.
Thomas is a member of DBE and played against Dylan, who supported Watford at the match.
Dave said the inclusive nature of the sport meant his family could all play, no matter their age or ability.
"It is about raising awareness and showing people they can do it, even if it is just to get you out the house," he said, adding that when his wife died, playing bowls helped him with grief. 
Simon Johnson, secretary of the WDBA, said: "It has been incredible in creating new friendships and highlighting the need for disability sports. 
"The charity director of the Hertfordshire Disability Sports Foundation attended and came up with great ideas for developing the sport."
DBE provides taster sessions for people to try bowling aids, special wheelchairs and equipment.
A spokesperson said: "Every penny raised is used to continue to deliver our vision of growing and developing our membership and making our sport truly inclusive for everyone throughout England."
WDBA added: "To have played in the game left us with a very warm feeling and the hope that equality and diversity will always be a major criteria in the future progress of the sport."
