A grandfather who has become an arm wrestling champion now hopes to continue the sport into his eighties.
Mark Waldon, 54, won a gold medal in the grand masters category at the European Championships in Finland. 
He only took up the sport three years ago at Milton Keynes Arm Wrestling Club after watching online videos while in bed with Covid. 
"I will arm wrestle for as long as I possibly can," he said. 
Mr Waldon, from Flitwick, Bedfordshire, works out for two hours per day and trains for longer than he ever has before.
"Everyone is so friendly, I love it," he said of his weekly practice on a Thursday evening. 
"You have to love it, you have to be dedicated to it. You've got to live it and train as hard as you possibly can."
The European grand masters category is for those aged between 50 and 60. 
Mr Waldon won in the 'under 105kg' weight division at the event in May. 
He dedicated his win to his father, who died shortly before the tournament. "I really wanted to win it for him and I did," he said.
The muscle man also arm wrestles with his grandchildren, Grace, four and Daniel, seven. 
Daniel described his grandfather's love of arm wrestling as "annoying" because "he always talks about it".
On Saturday Mark will compete at the British Championships in Birmingham to try to add another title to his collection.
Jason Brooks is a member of the same club and has been arm wrestling for 20 years. 
He said it was "amazing" that Mark had progressed so quickly in three years. 
"I have never met anyone in the sport who has progressed as far and has been as dedicated as he has," he said.
