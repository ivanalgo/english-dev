Leicester's festive ice rink is set to open later as part of the city's Christmas celebrations.
The indoor rink has been set up in Jubilee Square, alongside an Alpine-style bar, and will remain open until Christmas Eve.
Leicester City Council said it expected about 40,000 skaters to take to the ice in the coming weeks.
City mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said he hoped the rink would boost the city's economy.
He said: "The ice rink has become such an institution that its opening is the thing that gets many people thinking Christmas is finally around the corner.
"Of course it is quite expensive to set up but it covers its costs and, importantly, it will draw in people who shop in the city centre and visit restaurants and bars."
The council said the rink would be open from 10:00 to 20:45 GMT daily, with the last admissions for skating at 20:00. 
It said last admission for skaters on Christmas Eve would be at 16:00.
The rink is one of a number of city centre attractions including a 110ft (33.5m) Ferris wheel, also in Jubilee Square.
The city's traditional nativity scene has been set up in Town Hall Square, along with Santa's Grotto.
A light installation, called Emergence, will open at the bottom of New Walk on 13 December and includes more than 10,000 lights illuminating tunnels for visitors.
