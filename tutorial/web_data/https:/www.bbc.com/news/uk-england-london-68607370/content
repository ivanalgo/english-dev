Four people have been hurt in an attack by a suspected XL bully dog in south London.
Armed police were called after reports that the animal was dangerously out of control and attacking people in Home Road, Battersea, just after 22:00 GMT on Monday, the Met said.
Four men were taken to hospital for treatment for injuries that were not life-threatening.
The dog was then shot by police and two people were arrested over the incident.
Police said a man, 22, and a woman, 21, had been arrested on suspicion of being the owner or person in charge of a dog dangerously out of control.
Investigators were examining the dog to confirm its breed, the Met added.
From 1 February, it became a criminal offence to own the XL bully breed in England and Wales without an exemption certificate.
Anyone who owns one of the dogs must have the animal neutered and microchipped, and it must be kept muzzled and on a lead in public, among other restrictions.
Marsha de Cordova, the Labour MP for Battersea, said she was "deeply concerned" to hear of the attack.
She wrote on X that her "thoughts and prayers" were with those injured in the attack, and that it was "vital" there was a strong enforcement to ensure owners complied with legislation surrounding XL bully dogs.
