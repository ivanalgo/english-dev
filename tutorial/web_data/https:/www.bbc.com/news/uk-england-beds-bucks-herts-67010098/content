A decision has been made to demolish and rebuild part of a studio that Star Wars was filmed at after unsafe concrete was discovered.
Elstree Studios, in Hertfordshire, has been used for film and TV shows such as The Shining, The Crown and Pointless.
It had already been estimated that Â£150m was needed to remove asbestos.
Hertsmere Borough Council said parts of the studio would now be rebuilt after reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) was also found in the roof.  
Elstree Studios was built in the early 1900s, and a recent report said some of its infrastructure was "at least 100 years old and past its useful life".
In July the council, which owns the studios, said the roof of stages seven, eight and nine "were in a dangerous state".
Now the roof structure has been identified as showing presence of Raac panels.
Hertsmere Borough Council has now agreed to demolish and rebuild those stages.
Council leader Jeremy Newmark said the work was "key to ensuring the site remains competitive and aligned with emerging trends in the film and television industry".
