Relatives who found family members' headstones had been pushed over as part of a safety "topple test" have spoken of their distress. 
Eighty-seven headstones were pushed over at Haxby and Wigginton Cemetery near York to test their durability. 
Many people found out through an anonymous post in a community Facebook group, including Kirsty Richmond, whose father is buried at the cemetery. 
Haxby and Wigginton Cemetery Committee apologised for not giving notice. 
Chair Tony Richardson said it was meeting a statutory health and safety requirement of running a cemetery.
A notice at the cemetery dated 9 October stated the test was to be carried out two days later - but relatives claim it was back-dated.
Mr Richardson said: "It was agreed to put a notice out to inform people that this was going ahead. 
"Unfortunately the person who agreed to put the notice up didn't do so, and has apologised profusely."
"We have to work on goodwill. 
"We are very sorry and the person involved is very upset at the hurt that has been caused," he added.
He said relatives had been contacted individually. 
Ms Richmond said: "Initially we didn't think my dad's would be down because it seemed very secure to us when we tested it in August.
"When we went along and found it was down, it was devastating. 
"The cemetery is like a scene of devastation. 
"It's very distressing, it has been done very distastefully."
She called for those behind the scheme to step down and for a contribution towards the headstones' replacement or repair. 
A public meeting is due to take place at on Tuesday at 19:00 BST at the Oaken Grove Community Centre in Haxby.
