Two men have been charged with murdering 28-year-old Conor Browne.
The father-of-one was stabbed outside a pub in Castlederg in the early hours of Saturday and died in hospital on Monday.
The accused men are aged 27 and 28. The 28-year-old is further charged with possession of an offensive weapon and intent to commit an indictable offence.
They will appear before Dungannon Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.
Two other men, aged 28 and 31, were arrested and subsequently released following questioning and a file will be submitted to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS).
Earlier an assembly member, Sinn Féin's Maolíosa McHugh, said there was a "deep sense of shock and sadness" in Castlederg following the death of Mr Browne. 
Castlederg Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club Caisleán na Deirge Naomh Eoghan paid tribute to Mr Browne on its Facebook page. 
"Conor always wore the biggest smile and would have done anything for anyone. One of the real good guys," the club said.
On Monday evening, soccer players from St Patrick's Football Club in Castlederg held a minute's silence as a mark of respect for Mr Browne. 
A vigil is to be held at The Diamond in Castlederg on Wednesday evening.
