A woman said she was "disgusted" after her teenage grandson was given a single piece of chicken in a wrap for his school lunch.
The student was given the food at Lincolnshire's University Academy Holbeach, which has admitted it fell short of expectations.
Liz Cooper said: "That's not a lot of protein to keep a 16-year-old boy going all afternoon."
She added her grandson had now switched to bringing in a packed lunch.
Ms Cooper said she was shocked when she saw a picture of the meal.
When the boy complained, she claimed he was told to "add salad to the wrap".
"The chicken was the size of a piece of popcorn chicken, not even a goujon or a chicken nugget, it was smaller than that," said Ms Cooper.
"There's a little bit of sauce drizzled over it. Even adding in salad, that's not a lot of protein to keep a 16-year-old boy going all afternoon."
Ms Cooper wrote and complained to the secondary school, who told her "the caterers have agreed to look at the quality of the wraps and increase the quantity of chicken provided".
A spokesperson for University Academy Holbeach said: "The issue identified happened a number of weeks ago and was raised immediately with our external catering company. 
"Regrettably, on that occasion, the food provided to one of our students fell below what we would expect. 
"The catering company agreed that the food did not meet their usual standards and assured us that it will not happen again. 
"We continue to monitor this, and to work closely with them to ensure the quantity and quality of food provided meets the required standard".
The BBC has contacted the catering company for a response.
