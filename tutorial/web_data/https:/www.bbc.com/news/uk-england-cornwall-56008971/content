Arson is suspected to be the cause of a large moor fire which affected a nature reserve.
The blaze tore through nearly 50 acres of the Rosenannon Downs Nature Reserve near Wadebridge, Cornwall.
"These fires are started by people who clearly don't understand the damage they are doing," said Cornwall Wildlife Trust.
The blaze, which was driven by strong winds could be seen 18 miles (28km) away, said firefighters.
Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service confirmed it was treating the fire on Tuesday as suspected arson.
The blaze, which spread to multiple areas of gorse between Wadebridge and St Columb, was dampened down by 01:00 on Wednesday and no injuries were reported.
Cornwall Wildlife Trust said about a quarter of the nature reserve had been affected, causing "instant, direct decline in local biodiversity".
Callum Deveney, head of nature reserves, said: "We are working hard to provide the best possible habitats for wildlife on limited resources, and then some thoughtless actions ruin it all."
