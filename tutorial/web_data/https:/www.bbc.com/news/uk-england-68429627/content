A man who claimed he was being threatened by the mafia has been jailed for shooting his ex-wife's nephew.
Georgo Asllani, 59, from Albania, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of a firearm over attack in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, in June 2022.
Asllani, of Peregrine Road, Waltham Abbey, in Essex, had claimed a mysterious man called The Commander had ordered him to take responsibility.
He was jailed for 13 years.
Asllani drove to a house in Trinity Lane, Waltham Cross where the man and his brother were working and fired twice at the victim.
The victim claimed the barrel had been pointed at his face but that he raised his left hand and then saw white smoke. 
One bullet when through his left hand and the second embedded itself in his hand.
The men then began fighting on the ground when one of the victim's work colleagues helped restrain Asllani until the police arrived and arrested him.
Prosecutor Stefan Weidmann told St Albans Crown Court: "This defendant had previously been married to the aunt of the victim.
"The relationship ended, but acrimony endured. There was reference to a property in Albania."
The victim, who is left-handed, told the jury during a trail in November that he suffered flashbacks, had been unable to work and had needed multiple operations. 
Asllani told the jury he had been threatened by the mafia and that a mysterious man called The Commander had ordered him to take responsibility.
Defence counsel Liam Laughlin said his client, who worked as a tiler, was of previous good character in the UK and maintained his innocence.
Judge Lana Wood told him the background to the case appeared to be "a dispute between you and your ex-wife".
