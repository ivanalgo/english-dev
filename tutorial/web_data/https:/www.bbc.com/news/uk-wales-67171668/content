More people could die at a north Wales hospital if staff pressures are not eased, a coroner has said.
John Gittins, senior coroner for north Wales east and central, called on bosses at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, Denbighshire, to reveal plans for the "unsustainable" situation at its A&E.
He has issued Betsi Cadwaladr health board with a Report to Prevent Future Deaths.
It follows the death of Margaret Kelly, 82, from Rhos-on Sea, Conwy county.
On 28 March 2022, Mrs Kelly underwent surgery for a hernia repair, during which it is probable that her bowel was damaged.
An inquest last month heard that the following day she was in such pain that she went to A&E, but was not seen by a doctor for several hours.
By the morning of 30 March, her condition had deteriorated and further emergency surgery was carried out to repair her bowel, but she died the next day.
Mr Gittins' report said there were "several missed opportunities to optimise her care and treatment" and she no longer "had the resilience to recover from this procedure".
Evidence was given that, when she went to hospital, it was at Level 4 escalation, the highest level, and that was far from unusual.
"I am concerned that the pressure on clinicians and other staff is unsustainable and that delays in treatment will result in deaths," said Mr Gittins.
He added he did not consider that operating practices within the department were a cause for concern, but wanted to hear from executives about the steps being taken to cut pressure at the hospital.
The health board has until 4 December to respond to the coroner's notice.
