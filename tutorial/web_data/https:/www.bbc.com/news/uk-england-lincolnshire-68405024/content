A Bengal tiger that "everyone fell in love with" at Lincolnshire Wildlife Park has died, keepers have said.
Nine-year-old Lajuka was euthanised at the park on Monday after suffering kidney failure.
The Boston park announced the news "with a heavy heart" on its Facebook page.
Lajuka lived at the wildlife centre from the age of six weeks old and leaves behind four other Bengal tigers.
Steve Nichols, chief executive of Lincolnshire Wildlife Park, found out Lajuka had kidney failure after a blood test five months ago.
He said: "She was the pain-in-the-neck tiger that everyone fell in love with. One or two people had a special relationship with her."
When an animal dies at the park, Mr Nichols said it becomes a "very quiet place" but is something they have to "sadly get used to".
In the Facebook post, the park said Lajuka "took a turn for the worst" over the last few days and described her as "stubborn, headstrong and loving to the core".
"To say she will be missed is an understatement", it said.
Mr Nichols said kidney failure is the biggest killer in both domestic and wild cats, with no cure.
The park has already received around 5,000 messages of condolences following the announcement of Lajuka's passing.
