Police are appealing for information after several bin bags full of dead geese and pheasants were found dumped in woodlands.
Officers were called to Dyke Vale Road at the entrance of Birley Spa Wood, in Hackenthorpe, after a dog walker made the discovery on Sunday.
South Yorkshire Police said a plastic box containing geese feet was also found nearby.
The force said it believed other birds may also have been targeted.
A spokesperson said: "We're keen to hear from anyone who has witnessed suspicious behaviour in the area, or in connection to geese and birds, or has information that can assist with the investigation."
