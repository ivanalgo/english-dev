A factory has been evacuated after an ammonia leak.
South Wales Fire and Rescue Service sent 15 vehicles to a "substance leak" at a commercial premises on the Pontyfelin Industrial Estate at New Inn, near Pontypool, in Torfaen.
People living nearby had been urged to shut windows and doors as Torfaen council warned of a "very strong smell of ammonia in the area."
But Gwent Police and fire crews say the leak has now been contained.
The leak caused the main A4042 road between Newport and Abergavenny to be shut for about three hours around New Inn but that has now been reopened.
Police have said although the ammonia has been "contained within the site", officers are asking people to avoid the area as a "precautionary measure".
There are numerous commercial units at the Pontyfelin Industrial Estate and images from scene showed emergency crews around the Evron Easibake Foods factory. 
Police say all staff have been accounted for and no injuries have been reported.
The fire service said it received reports of the substance leak at about 07:50 GMT and responded on a "multi-agency basis with our partners to contain the substance".
