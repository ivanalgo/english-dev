 Brighton and Hove City Council says it is proposing to close two primary schools due to falling pupil numbers. 
St Bartholomew's Church of England Primary School in Brighton and St Peter's Community Primary School in Portslade are at risk.
Katie Blood, head teacher at St Bartholomew's, said the decision could be made by February or March.
The council's plans also include reducing intake numbers at nine other primary schools in the city.
Jacob Taylor, co-chair of the council's children, families and school's committee, said: "Having very high numbers of unfilled school places isn't something we can allow to continue, and as a responsible council, we must take decisive action.
 "We want to assure everyone that if the closures go ahead this will be very carefully managed to minimise the impact on children, their families and all the staff."
Ms Blood said falling pupil numbers had "been an issue for about 10 years" in the city.
"Action is being taken, but it's not being thought through."
Parents and teachers say the schools cater for children with special educational needs (SEN).
Ms Blood told BBC Radio Sussex: "Uprooting our children from the safe setting, from the warm dedicated staff, would be devastating to them."
Emily Roe, who has three children at St Bartholomew's, said: "Due to the nature of St Bart's, the children are disproportionately disadvantaged, so will be disproportionately impacted by closure of the school."
Ms Blood suggested a better alternative to suddenly closing schools would be for them to stop taking new pupils, so any existing children could complete their full primary education.
