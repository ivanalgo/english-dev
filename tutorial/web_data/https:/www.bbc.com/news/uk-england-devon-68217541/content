An African lion who lived at a wildlife park in Devon for more than 15 years has died.
Combe Martin Wildlife and Dinosaur Park said it made the "hard decision" to euthanise the lion named Lenny whose health "continued to deteriorate" despite medication.
It followed the death of Lenny's brother, Leo, in January 2023.
The park said Lenny would be "greatly missed" by those who had been blessed to hear him roar.
Carnivore keeper, Rebecca Walker, said: "What I loved the most about Lenny was that he always presented himself as a big scary boy who took himself too seriously.
"But when he thought you weren't looking, he'd play with whatever enrichment we'd given him, such as his favourite toy or perfume - he would turn into a kitten."
Lenny arrived at the park in 2008 when he was nine months old, alongside his two brothers Leo and Sampson. 
They came from Linton Zoo in Cambridgeshire.
Ms Walker said: "We all miss him so much at the park, not hearing his roar in the afternoons is very strange and something I will never get used to."
A spokesperson for the park said Lenny and Leo had been "firm favourites" with visitors. 
"Lenny was always more nervous of people, so those people that got to carry out our lion feed experience with him were very privileged.
"He was a very handsome lion, who had a magnificent mane that ran right down his belly and it always looked striking when he was sat on his rock."
The park described Lenny as "a big character, who loved his food, sunbathing and rolling around in anything smelly".
