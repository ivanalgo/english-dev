A man has been arrested after an elderly pedestrian was struck by a car in a suspected hit-and-run. 
The victim, in his 80s, sustained a serious head injury in the Bebington area of Wirral at 19:40 GMT on Monday. 
A 23-year-old man from Tranmere has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. 
Merseyside Police said the pedestrian was struck by dark BMW, which reportedly left the scene "immediately". 
However officers said the driver of the vehicle returned a "short time later". 
The car believed to have been involved was later recovered from Sandymount Drive in Bebington.
There are road closures in place while police examine the scene of the collision at the junction of Teehey Lane and Roland Avenue. 
Insp Phil McManus, from Merseyside's Matrix Roads Policing Unit, said he wanted to trace anyone travelling in the area at the time who saw the collision or had any information about the car's movements immediately afterwards.
"We would also ask any taxi or delivery drivers who were in the area of Teehey Lane or Sandymount Drive to check their dashcam to see if they captured anything significant," he added.
