A new section of coastal path has officially opened in West Sussex. 
A 44-mile (71km) stretch of the King Charles III England Coast Path will take walkers from Shoreham-by-Sea to West Wittering. 
It forms part of a 2,700 mile (4,345km) coast path around England due to be completed by the end of 2024.
Jim Seymour from Natural England said the new trail had "spectacular sweeping coastal views" while providing "sustainable sea defences".
The new stretch through West Sussex is mainly open coastal plain with long beaches, seaside resorts and nature reserves teeming with birds.
Mr Seymour added: "Excitingly for the first time in the history of public access, legal rights of public access will be secured to typical coastal land including beaches, dune and cliffs, allowing walkers to access some places they've never been before."
The route passes through coastal towns such as Littlehampton, Bognor Regis and Worthing. 
Deborah Urquhart from West Sussex County Council said: "The works have provided new boardwalks, improvements to path surfaces, and better signage, providing a much needed boost for local businesses and making it easier than ever to visit our varied landscapes."
