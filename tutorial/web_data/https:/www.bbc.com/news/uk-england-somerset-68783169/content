Tourism bosses in the Somerset village of Porlock says fewer families have to come stay this Easter.
The wet weather has hit local campsites yet the local butcher had a busier Easter than usual, although trade has since dropped off. 
B&B accommodation has remained steady but all have noticed a drop in village footfall after lunchtime.
Local cafes say rain in the morning has led to low footfall all day.  
Deborah Stanyon, the Porlock Information Centre Manager, said wet campsites meant fewer campers which in turn has led to drop in numbers.
"I think it's fair to say in Porlock in particular it's been disappointing," she said.
"The businesses I chatted to, they have felt that there were less families here over Easter than they would normally be.
"Our butcher had a really, really good Easter, and that may well be because a lot of people were coming for self catering, or families were having their relatives to stay. So he had a really really busy Easter, but he said literally, from after Easter he has been absolutely dead."
Somerset has been the recent focus of a documentary on Channel 5 and that has had a positive impact.
"Certainly Exmoor and West Somerset did really really well out of that publicity, and I know from one of our bed and breakfast providers that the programme went out one evening, and by lunchtime the next morning they had taken three bed and breakfast bookings," Ms Stanyon added.
