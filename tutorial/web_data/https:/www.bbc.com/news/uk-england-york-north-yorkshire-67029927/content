A railway station that closed in 1930 is set to be reopened as part of the government's Network North scheme.
Rishi Sunak set out plans to invest £19.8bn in transport infrastructure in the North after the cancellation of the northern leg of HS2 on Wednesday. 
The plans include reopening Haxby train station, just north of York, which first opened in 1845.
City of York Council said: "The ambition for a station at Haxby has been held for many years."
Councillor Ian Cuthbertson, who represents the Haxby and Wigginton ward, said: "This vital transport link will transform connectivity for residents to the north-east of York via the new station at Haxby. 
"It is imperative that this project now goes ahead without any further confusion or delay from the government."
The council said that before Wednesday's HS2 announcement by the prime minister it had been working with Network Rail and other partners to get the additional funding necessary to deliver the railway station.
This was presented to the Department for Transport in March this year.
In spring 2022, 1,200 people took part in a public consultation exercise to allow residents to express their views on the initial plans, designs and use of the new station.
It found that 81% supported the proposal for a station in Haxby. 
Some 78% said they would use the station for leisure travel, 66% would use it as part of longer distance journeys (such as to London and Manchester Airport), and 33% would use it as part of their daily commute.
