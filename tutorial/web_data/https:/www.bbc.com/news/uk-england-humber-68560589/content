A broadband pole installed opposite a war memorial is "disrespectful", a local councillor has claimed.
The wooden telegraph pole has been put up by MS3 Networks on Welton Road in Brough, East Yorkshire.
East Riding of Yorkshire councillor Coleen Gill said she was worried the pole could reduce the space available for Remembrance Day events.
MS3 chief executive Guy Miller said he was willing to visit the site and discuss the installation with Ms Gill.
The independent councillor said she went down to the site to talk to the workers after she got a call saying a hole was being dug.
"I had an email on my phone from MS3 saying they we were going to respect the soldiers," she said.
"I showed it to the contractors but they just carried on, saying they'd got a permit.
"I tried to explain to them that at least three times a year quite a lot of people come to the Remembrance services and other events they do and there's just enough room for people to stand on one corner of the junction.
"It's very rare that we can get a traffic order to close the road because they're so expensive, but most people know about the services and that lots of people will be there.
She added: "It's so disrespectful to the soldiers and they don't seem to care about the people who live in an area."
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Mr Miller said the company tried to be respectful with the placement of their infrastructure.
"We aim to plan our fibre deployment with consideration and respect," he said.
"In this case we ensured that our telegraph pole was located further away from the war memorial than the pre-existing telegraph pole is. 
"We will visit the site this week to review the location and are happy to speak with councillor Gill about her concerns."
