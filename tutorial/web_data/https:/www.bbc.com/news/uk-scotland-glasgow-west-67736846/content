A man and a woman have been arrested and charged after drugs worth over Â£1m were found in Clydebank. 
Police Scotland said the 37-year-old man and 31-year-old woman were arrested on Friday after an investigation by the Argyll and West Dunbartonshire serious and organised crime team. 
The drugs had been found at a property on Kilbowie Road, Clydebank, on 9 July.
The pair were charged with money laundering, involvement in the supply of drugs and organised crime offences.
They are due to appear at Dumbarton Sheriff Court on Monday. 
Det Ch Insp Samantha Glasgow said: "This is a significant recovery and is an example of our efforts to disrupt the trade in illegal drugs in West Dunbartonshire.
"Organised crime has a profound impact on our communities, and we will continue to target criminals and those who assist them in their activities."
