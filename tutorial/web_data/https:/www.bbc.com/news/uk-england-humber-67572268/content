An outbreak of norovirus has led to the closure of two wards at Hull Royal Infirmary, bosses said.
A further seven wards were "partially affected" on Wednesday as a result of the winter vomiting bug, they added.
People are "strongly discouraged" from visiting affected wards. Those who do choose to visit will be asked to follow infection control measures. 
The trust, which runs the hospital, insisted it was "not unusual" to see cases of such viruses during winter.
Wards 100 and 500 are closed, with wards 7, 9, 10, 11, 90, 110 and 130 West also affected. 
A spokesperson for Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: "Where visiting is considered necessary, all visitors should avoid sitting on beds and follow infection prevention and control advice given by the nurse in charge while in hospital. 
"Visiting for patients in exceptional circumstances will always be facilitated, for example if the patient has dementia or is at end of life."
According to the trust, norovirus is "usually quite mild", with symptoms lasting about 48 hours. However, experts warn people can remain infectious for a further 48 hours after their symptoms have gone.
