A rail line has been partially closed after part of the track bed subsided.
It followed a landslip near Bicester North station in Oxfordshire caused by recent heavy rainfall, the operator said.
It said the damage was still being assessed, although normal services would not resume until at least Monday.
No trains are running between Oxford and London Marylebone, while a reduced service is running between Marylebone and Birmingham Moor Street.
