A riverside park is set to undergo changes to make it more welcoming for people and wildlife.
The proposed improvements to the Staddlestones Riverside Park in Midsomer Norton, Somerset, are part of the Somer Valley Rediscovered project.
In a public consultation, additional seating and planting trees and meadows were ranked among the most important improvements.
The scheme aims to improve accessibility and biodiversity.
The consultation by Bath and North East Somerset Council (BANES) in May 2023 asked the local community to comment on the development and longer-term management of the park. 
More than 300 comments were received, including 86 survey responses and feedback from 100 residents who attended an event in the park.
The updated plan now includes new and improved pathways, the addition of a dry circuit route around the park, extra benches and seats, more trees and the creation of meadow areas in the northern field to encourage wildlife.
Proposals to remove the park entrance gates completely have been changed following feedback.
Instead, they will be replaced with a lockable bollard at the north entrance off Cautletts Close and a chicane with removable panels at the south entrance.
This will improve accessibility for pram, wheelchair and mobility scooter users and slow 'escaping' children and dogs, the council said.
The existing football pitch will be replaced with two smaller goals which will increase the amount of open grassland.
A boules pitch will be added, and the council's parks service will replace the existing swings with an accessible swing.
