A city centre flat has been partially closed by police following complaints about drug use and anti-social behaviour.
An order has been served on 25B Lincoln Road in Peterborough following a court hearing.
The property is now out of bounds to anyone apart from the legal tenant and some service providers.
Police warned unauthorised visitors could be jailed for up to three months, fined or both.
Cambridgeshire Police said it had received complaints about drug supply, drug use and related anti-social behaviour at the flat.
Peterborough Magistrates Court granted a partial closure order on Wednesday, which will remain in place until 19 March.
It means the property is closed to anyone other than the legal tenant, emergency services, support services and contractors.
Tom Maltby from Peterborough's city centre neighbourhood policing team said: "Concerns have been brought to our attention about open drug use around the flat as well as intimidating and anti-social behaviour.
"By taking this action, we hope to provide some reassurance to the community that we have listened to their concerns and are taking action to resolve the issues."
