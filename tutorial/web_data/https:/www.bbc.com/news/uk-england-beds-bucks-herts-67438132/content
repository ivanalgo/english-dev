A teenage skateboarder was killed when he crashed into a bollard at a Center Parcs, an inquest heard. 
Alfie Richley, 17, suffered traumatic abdominal injuries at the Woburn Forest resort in Bedfordshire while he was on holiday with his family. 
He died in hospital the same day. 
Coroner's officer Ben Horrell told an inquest that Alfie was skateboarding on a path on 26 October at 15:50 BST when he fell into the bollard.
"He sustained traumatic injuries to the abdomen. He was taken to Bedford South Wing Hospital. The injury proved fatal and he died the same day," said Mr Horrell, speaking at The Court House in Ampthill, Bedfordshire.
A post-mortem examination found that Alfie's cause of death was traumatic abdominal injuries. 
Bedfordshire senior coroner Emma Whitting adjourned the inquest and said a pre-inquest review would be held on 21 February next year.
She said: "I take this opportunity to send my condolences to Alfie's family for their loss." 
Yesterday, an inquest was opened into the death of a Center Parcs worker at the same holiday resort. 
Penny Bulpitt, 67, from Luton, was a supervisor at Woburn Forest. The coroner was told she was riding a push bike when she was struck by an electric buggy driven by another member of staff, shortly after midnight on 22 September.
