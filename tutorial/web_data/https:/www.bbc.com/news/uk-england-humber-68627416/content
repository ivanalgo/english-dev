Concrete tables with built-in chess boards and seating have been placed in two Hull parks.
The boards were installed at East Park, near to the boating lake and in Pearson Park in west Hull, close to the pond and café.
Hull City Council used £5,000 from the government's Levelling Up Parks Fund towards the cost.
They are free to use, but initially players will have to bring their own chess pieces.
The council said the idea was to promote socialising as well as raising the city's profile as a national centre for chess.
Councillor Jack Haines, portfolio holder for communities at the council, said: "Chess is game which anyone from any background can play and it can provide hours of entertainment and competition.
"It is yet another fantastic attraction for our already popular parks in Hull."
The boards were installed after a consultation with the Hull and East Riding Chess Association (HERCA).
The organisation plans to establish chess events in both parks later in the year.
HERCA president Graham Chesters said "Taking chess into parks is a great idea. 
"We expect it to generate a lot of interest and we'd be delighted if it set a model for community chess in other spaces."
