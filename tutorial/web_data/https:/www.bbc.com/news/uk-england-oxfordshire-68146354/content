A cyclist who died in a crash was a "remarkable man" with a "formidable intellect", his family have said.
Tim Joss, 68, was riding on Witney Road, near his home in Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, on 24 January when he was in collision with a car travelling in the same direction.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The driver of the red VW Polo, a 19-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving and later bailed.
Mr Joss was a gifted pianist, a talented mathematician, a bridge builder and a visionary leader, according to his wife, science broadcaster Vivienne Parry OBE.
After reading maths at the University of Oxford, Mr Joss went on to study piano at the Royal Academy of Music before managing the Bournemouth orchestras and becoming Artistic Director of the Bath Festivals.
In the past 10 years, Mr Joss founded Aesop Arts & Society, an arts and health charity, and his work helped reduce older people's risk of falling.
His widow, daughter and step-sons said: "His most special gift was his love; which was warm, unbounded and generous.
"Sadly his death has robbed his granddaughter, Clemency, from knowing the joy of growing up with that love."
Thames Valley Police is investigating the collision.
