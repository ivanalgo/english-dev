A safe creative space that encourages people of African, Caribbean and Asian heritage to explore their identities has been launched.
Artist Rider Shafique, Khali Ackford and Jamell Ackford launched the meet up in the Trinity Centre in Bristol.
The free programme will work with a support group once a month to create photography and mixed media pieces.
He said the group will allow black creatives to celebrate their identities and to not feel "othered".
Mr Shafique said he started the meet up with Jamell Ackford and Khali Ackford from the Trinity Centre, because "not enough safe spaces exist" for black artists.
"When you go to other spaces your culture isn't celebrated or taken into account," he said.
"You feel othered. Creative spaces need to be more diverse."
Gloucester artist Rafeelya, who attended the first session of the year on 24 January, said the new meet-ups will inspire content "that needs to be seen".
"People need spaces where they feel seen and heard," she said.
"It's important. People need to feel they can be creative without the pressures of society."
Photographer and group co-founder, Khali Ackford, said he wants people who come to the space to "feel comfortable to talk about anything".
"We can share ideas to a black audience. Not to an audience who do not understand it," he said.
"The group will be the starting point for other things. Who knows what will be created. 
"We definitely will use our I-Dentity project as a point of inspiration."
Trinity venue manager and group co-founder Jamell Ackford added: "We're really excited to to explore this opportunity. The group is growing and growing every month."
The group will meet at the Trinity Centre every fourth Monday of the month.
