A naked swimming club has warned it may have to shut if a leisure centre reduces its opening hours.
Western Swimming Club, which has members from across south Wales and the west of England, wants Monmouthshire council to rethink the early closure of Chepstow Leisure Centre.
The club has been meeting for almost 50 years, but said it may become "economically unviable" to operate.
The council said it was in touch with the club over the impact of the change.
The club said its weekly sessions without swimsuits will not be financially possible if the 1hr 45m block booking is reduced by half an hour.
It also wants the council to rethink a proposed increase in hire charges. 
It has asked Chepstow Town Council for its support in appealing to the county council not to try to cover the gap in its budget at the expense of its members.
It warned that if the club no longer meets,the centre would lose out on £10,019 in revenue over the year. 
The club told the council that it provides an economic boost to Chepstow as members travel for the regular Friday evening meetings.
It also said it organises social events in Chepstow and across Monmouthshire. 
Monmouthshire council agreed cuts of  £8.4m as part of its budget process this year.
Leisure centres in Monmouth, Abergavenny and Caldicot, as well as Chepstow will close half an hour earlier every weeknight, and an hour and half earlier on weekends, to help save £140,000 from April.
The council said it was in touch with the naturist swimming club over the impact of reduced opening hours. 
A spokesman told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: "MonLife [the leisure arm of the council] officers will now be holding meetings with all clubs that use the leisure centres to discuss how their needs can be accommodated during the new opening times."
