A total of nine vehicles parked in Ballymoney, County Antrim, have been burnt out in overnight arson attacks, police have said.
The vehicles were set alight on Union Street, Seymore Street and Knock Road during the early hours of Saturday.
Insp Richard Jack said firefighters went to the scene and put the blazes out.
DUP councillor for the Ballymoney area Mervyn Storey described the incidents as "random and reckless".
Andrew Doherty, who lives on Union Street, said:  "I heard a large bang at 3am and went downstairs - at that time the fires were going strong and the fire brigade arrived.
"I'm shocked. Something like this doesn't normally happen in the area. 
"Nobody knows why it's happened. I've been talking with the other residents and they are shocked and surprised."
Police are trying to establish a motive for the incidents and have appealed for information.
