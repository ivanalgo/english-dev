A convenience store had its alcohol licence suspended for selling a vape five times the legal limit to a PCSO.
The 24/7 Express Local store in Clasketgate, Lincoln was handed a three-month suspension.
It means the shop will be unable to sell alcohol for that period, unless the owner appeals.
The city council's licensing committee heard an officer was sent to the shop after information that it was "potentially selling illegal products".
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the PCSO asked for a vape of between 3,500 and 6,000 puffs.
Despite initially being refused, the officer was presented with a box of 3,500-4,000 puff vapes and he bought one for £14.99.
By law a vape can only hold around 2ml of liquid, which is the equivalent of 600 puffs. 
A report by Lincolnshire Police presented to the meeting said the shop owner was warned and offered advice on licensing requirements in letters sent on 22 September and 15 December.
On a follow up visit by police and trading standard officers on 18 January a "quantity of illegal e-cigarettes were seized from under the countertop."
"On further inspection more illegal vapes were found hidden under the counter unit in boxes on the floor," the police report added.
A decision was made to suspend the shop's licence for three months, with the police claiming licensing objectives of "prevention of crime and disorder and public safety have been undermined."
