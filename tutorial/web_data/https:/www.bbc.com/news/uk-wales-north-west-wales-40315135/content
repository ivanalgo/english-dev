A person has been rescued after a catamaran capsized off the north Wales coast.
The vessel was towed back to shore following the rescue off Llanfairfechan, Conwy county at about 16:10 BST on Saturday.
Beaumaris RNLI lifeboat and the Bangor coastguard were involved in the rescue.
Just an hour earlier the crew rescued a kayaker who was trapped by the tide at Puffin Island, off Anglesey.
