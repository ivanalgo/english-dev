INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The IndyCar Series docked driver Ryan Hunter-Reay three points and put him on probation for the next three races for his role in a three-car crash at the Grand Prix of Louisiana that collected Simon Pagenaud and Sebastien Bourdais last weekend.
IndyCar said Wednesday that the Andretti Autosport driver violated a rule on avoidable contact during a restart with less than 10 minutes remaining of the rain-shortened road race.
Hunter-Reay squeezed Pagenaud onto a wet spot, which caused the Frenchmen to slide onto grass and then back on track at the next turn, where he broadsided Hunter-Reay and collected Bourdais as all three cars slid off the track and into a tire wall.
Pagenaud later said he was basically driven off the track while Hunter-Reay maintained he did nothing wrong.
