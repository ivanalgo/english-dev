WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says she has confidence in Hillary Rodham Clinton’s integrity and says the Democratic presidential candidate was smart to confront a controversy over her private email server by apologizing.
Pelosi told reporters Thursday that she “never doubted” Clinton’s claim that she did not send or receive emails marked as classified while she was secretary of state.
But Pelosi said that since the email issue has “become a fascination with the press, I think (Clinton) was smart to put it behind” her by apologizing.
After weeks of resisting an apology, Clinton said Tuesday that using a personal email account run on a private server to conduct government business was a “mistake,” adding “I’m sorry about that. I take responsibility.”
This story has been corrected to remove an extraneous word, “put,” from the first paragraph.
