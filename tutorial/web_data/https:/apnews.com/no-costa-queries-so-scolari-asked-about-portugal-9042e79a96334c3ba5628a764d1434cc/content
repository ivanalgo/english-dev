RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari requested that no more questions be asked about Diego Costa’s decision to play for Spain instead of his native Brazil.
So instead of inquires about Costa on Thursday as Scolari named Brazil’s team for two upcoming friendlies, he was probed about his own controversial choice to coach Portugal after leading Brazil to the 2002 World Cup title.
That question from a Brazilian reporter — which Scolari called “ridiculous” — didn’t please him either.
