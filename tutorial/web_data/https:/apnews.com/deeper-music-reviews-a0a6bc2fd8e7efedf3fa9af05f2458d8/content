Deeper, “Auto-Pain” (Fire Talk)
Chicago-based Deeper fires on all cylinders on its sophomore album “Auto-Pain,” delivering an energetic post-punk experience that excels by all measures.
There’s a deftly controlled pace that impresses throughout the album, a standout 12-track release that borrows its ethos from Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World.”
The band seeks clarity here, in opposition to Huxley’s fictitious “soma” pill which numbs the senses. Deeper wants you to feel alive again and injects the right amount of energy to make that happen.
They succeed on rambunctious tracks such as “Esoteric” and “Helena’s Flowers,” with its prowling bass line and stabbing melody. The two tracks owe much of its vibe to drummer Shiraz Bhatti, who doles out patterns he heard growing up at Native American Pow Wows. Indeed, it wows.
Above all the dystopian fight-for-life messages, Deeper delivers a complex and well-produced sound that feels as relevant now as it might have in the late 1980s. Sizzling guitar, vibrant vocals from Nic Gohl and a wonderful sense of urgency.
Deeper is well-deserving of expanded attention thanks to this nicely-crafted album.
