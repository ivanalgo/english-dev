UVALDE, Texas (AP) — A driver facing up to 270 years in prison for causing a Texas wreck that killed 13 people has been arrested for allegedly violating bond while awaiting sentencing.
Uvalde (yoo-VAL'-dee) County records show Jack Dillon Young of Leakey was jailed Tuesday without bond. Young was arrested July 12 after allegedly testing positive for the active agent in marijuana.
Young, after the March 2017 crash, told investigators he’d texted and was on prescription drugs when his vehicle hit a minibus from First Baptist Church of New Braunfels. That driver and 12 passengers died. One passenger survived.
Officers found marijuana in Young’s truck.
Young in May pleaded no contest to intoxication assault and 13 counts of intoxication manslaughter, with sentencing set for November.
Prosecutors and a defense lawyer didn’t immediately return messages Tuesday.
