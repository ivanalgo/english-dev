FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — New York Jets wide receiver Robby Anderson was limited at practice after tweaking a hamstring, and his status for the game against the Denver Broncos is uncertain.
Anderson was a full participant Wednesday, but was listed on the team’s injury report with a hamstring issue. Coach Todd Bowles says the second-year receiver had a setback Thursday, but hopes it isn’t serious.
The Jets’ offense would take a big hit if Anderson is unable to play. He’s having a breakout season with 49 catches for a team-leading 821 yards and seven touchdowns. Anderson and Jermaine Kearse are the first pair of Jets receivers to have consecutive games with 100 yards receiving since Don Maynard and George Sauer in 1967.
Linebacker Bruce Carter (groin) did not practice. Cornerback Juston Burris (concussion), running back Matt Forte (knee) and guard Brian Winters (abdomen, ankle) were limited.
