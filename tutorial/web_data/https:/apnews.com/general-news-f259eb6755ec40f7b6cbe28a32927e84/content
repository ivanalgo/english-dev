MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Scholars and die-hard fans of the Grateful Dead will gather in New Hampshire for a weeklong conference that looks at the cultural impact of the band.
Saint Anselm College in Manchester will host “A Long Strange Trip: The Culture of the Grateful Dead,” from Oct. 22 through Oct. 25. The event will feature panels and discussions that touch on subjects such as how the iconic band with songs like “Friend of the Devil” and “Terrapin Station” influenced pop culture as well as drug culture.
The event concludes with something that the band’s late lead guitarist Jerry Garcia would have loved — a musical jam.
Among the speakers will be Thomas Mangan, a filmmaker and executive producer of a four-part documentary on the Grateful Dead, titled “Long Strange Trip.”
