Terry Dolan, “Terry Dolan” (High Moon)
This Age of Aquarius artifact sounded old in 1972, when it was recorded, because the vibe is more ‘60s than ‘70s. On the other hand, Terry Dolan serves up a soundtrack for 2016 when he sings “Rainbow, rainbow, God knows we need a rainbow.”
Dolan’s debut album is both new and old, because it took 44 years to be released. The Warner Bros. label shelved the project after the music was in the can, and there it remained until being rescued by High Moon Records in a handsome package that includes a 48-page booklet, the original eight-song album and six outtakes.
“Terry Dolan” deserves to be heard, mostly because the San Francisco folk rocker assembled an excellent supporting cast. Half the songs were produced by Rolling Stones pianist Nicky Hopkins, and he pounds away with infectious energy. Guitarists John Cipollina, Greg Douglass and Neal Schon all shine at times, and exuberant backing vocals are provided by the young Pointer Sisters.
Dolan gives the instrumentalists tons of time to stretch out — too much, in fact. The songs are long, the lyrics thin. But the album shows promise, and Dolan went on to decades of success in the Bay Area with his band Terry & The Pirates. He died in 2012, sadly making this a posthumous debut.
