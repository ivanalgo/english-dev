NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Country star Carrie Underwood and NHL player Mike Fisher chose the Labor Day holiday to announce they are expecting their first child.
Underwood and Fisher posted the announcement on their social media accounts on Monday. Underwood’s publicist confirmed the couple will be expecting their first child in the spring.
The 31-year-old Underwood shot to fame after winning “American Idol.” She has won six Grammys and sold more than 15 million albums worldwide. She was the first woman to twice win the Academy of Country Music’s entertainer of the year award.
She will be co-hosting the upcoming Country Music Association Awards with Brad Paisley this November.
Fisher, a 34-year-old center for the Nashville Predators, is recovering from a ruptured left Achilles tendon and is expected to miss the start of the season.
