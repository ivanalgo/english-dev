BROKEN ARROW, Okla. (AP) — Community leaders in Broken Arrow have dedicated a memorial park on the former site of a home where five members of a northeastern Oklahoma family were killed by other family members.
A ceremony was held Wednesday to dedicate Reflection Park on the former site of the Bever family’s home in Broken Arrow, about 13 miles (21 kilometers) southeast of Tulsa.
Authorities say two brothers, 22-year-old Robert Bever and 20-year-old Michael Bever, fatally stabbed their parents, two brothers and a sister in 2015 as part of a plot to carry out mass killings across the country. Robert Bever pleaded guilty in 2016 and Michael Bever was convicted in the deaths last year. 
Both are serving life sentences
 .
The house was demolished following a 
2017 fire
 and purchased for a park.
