WASHINGTON (AP) — Former House Speaker John Boehner has returned to the Capitol, six weeks after he stepped down as House leader.
The Ohio Republican said on Friday in posts on Facebook and Twitter that he visited South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, the chairman of the House committee investigating the deadly attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and the committee’s staff.
Boehner said he thanked Gowdy and committee staffers for their efforts “to bring Americans the truth” about the 2012 attacks that killed four Americans. The U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, was among them. Boehner created the special committee in May 2014.
He said is grateful for the panel’s work to “help ensure that the full truth about the events surrounding the attack is known and that justice is finally served for the families of the fallen.”
A spokesman for Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said Boehner did not stop by his old office during his Capitol visit.
