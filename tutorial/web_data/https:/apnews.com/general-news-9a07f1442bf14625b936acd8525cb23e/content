ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A former Florida A&M University band member awaiting punishment more than two years after playing a role in a drum major’s hazing death has had his sentencing pushed back a month.
Caleb Jackson was scheduled to appear before Judge Marc Lubet on Tuesday, but was not transferred to Orange County from another facility where he is currently serving time in an unrelated case. His sentencing is now set for Aug. 27.
The 26-year-old pleaded no contest to manslaughter and felony hazing in 2013 for his role in death of Robert Champion, who was from Decatur, Georgia. Jackson faces 35 years in prison.
A judge previously gave Jackson prison time after his arrest in Champion’s case for violating his probation in a battery case.
Fifteen former FAMU band members were charged in Champion’s death. One received six years in prison, and another was given a year in county jail.
Most were sentenced to combinations of community service and probation.
