Colt Ford, “Thanks For Listening” (Average Joe’s)
Country music’s pre-eminent singer/rapper Colt Ford is out with his fifth studio album, “Thanks For Listening,” a release thick with featured vocals from other artists and a keen ear toward the caricature of the country lifestyle.
This is mostly good old boy territory, with an occasional hip-hop backing beat thrown in for good measure. “The High Life,” featuring Chase Rice alongside Ford, says as much. There’s football-watching, hard-drinking and late-night living to be had, and Ford’s having it all at high speed.
“Cut Em All” also delivers a mean country swagger, replete with four-wheeling and hunting. It even has featured vocals from Willie Robertson of the hit TV series “Duck Dynasty.” It begins with a duck call and continues with a rapped laundry list of things that, for better or worse, define the American South. There’s not much storytelling to it, but perhaps Ford fans don’t require as much.
Ford’s lyrics aren’t always the meatiest, but his approach is not to dwell too deeply on the human condition. He’s here to have fun and let us all know how he had it.
Mission accomplished, Colt Ford.
