SRINAGAR, India (AP) — An Indian soldier was killed in fighting with suspected rebels who allegedly infiltrated into India’s portion of Kashmir from the Pakistani side, an Indian army officer said Friday.
The two sides exchanged gunfire on Thursday night close to the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir between India and Pakistan, the officer said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.
There was no independent confirmation of his claim.
The area where the fighting took place is close to the region where Indian soldiers were recently engaged in fighting with groups of suspected militants for nearly two weeks. Eight insurgents were killed and six Indian soldiers wounded in those battles, according to the Indian army.
