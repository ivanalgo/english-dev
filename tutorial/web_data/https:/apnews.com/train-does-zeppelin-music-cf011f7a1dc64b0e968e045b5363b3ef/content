Train, “Does Led Zeppelin II” (Crush Music/Atlantic)
Train’s “Does Led Zeppelin II” is a faithful, needless cover of the British band’s 1969 classic.
If you walked into a bar and the band played Led Zeppelin like Train does, you might do a double take. Pat Monahan, who got his start in a Led Zep cover band, reaches the Robert Plant notes with less grit and depth of emotion, while the rest of the group clearly knows the album intimately.
Train’s renditions are proficient if sterile with some especially feeble backing vocals.
On the bright side, proceeds from “DLZII” will benefit a charity — Family House, offering temporary lodging for families of ill kids being treated at a hospital in San Francisco, the band’s hometown.
Listeners may tip their caps to Train and hopefully get motivated to pick up the original release. After all, some people discovered Frank Zappa on The Monkees’ TV show, first heard Chuck Berry and the Ramones on “The Simpsons” and sought out Sam & Dave, Otis Redding or Solomon Burke because of The Blues Brothers.
So if you’re feeling charitable, are a Train fan or just curious about how “Heartbreaker,” ’'Whole Lotta Love” or “Ramble On” sound in the hands of the three-time Grammy winners known for “Drops of Jupiter” and “Hey, Soul Sister,” this is for you. And only you.
