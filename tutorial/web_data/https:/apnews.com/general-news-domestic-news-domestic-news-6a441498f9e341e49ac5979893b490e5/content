ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) â€” A judge has postponed until September the trial of five remaining defendants charged in the hazing death of a Florida A&M University drum major to allow defense attorneys more time to prepare.
Judge Renee Roche agreed during a hearing Monday to delay it the trial that was set to begin next week until Sept. 22. Attorneys for three defendants asked the judge for a continuance, citing difficulty taking depositions of potential prosecution witnesses.
Fifteen former band members were charged with manslaughter and hazing in the November 2011 death of Robert Champion of Decatur, Georgia. Seven accepted plea deals of community service and probation for what prosecutors called minor roles.
Jessie Baskin pleaded no contest and was sentenced to a year in jail in March.
