NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) — A large monument honoring the late country singer George Jones has been unveiled at his Nashville gravesite and his widow has announced a college scholarship in his name.
Fans of the singer who died in April at the age of 81 crowded about the cemetery site on Monday to see the memorial unveiled with his wife and other relatives present.
The monument features a large arch with his best known song title, “He Stopped Loving Her Today,” inscribed in the stone under his name.
It also features images of Jones and his widow, Nancy Jones, a guitar and his nickname, “The Possum.” Two benches are placed on either side of his grave for visiting fans.
“All of his fans are really hardcore country music fans,” his widow said. “I think they deserve to come out and see something just a little different. They can sit on the bench and see their idol.”
Nancy Jones told reporters that the singer began the design for the monument years ago, but it wasn’t complete when he died. She also said that she would be starting a scholarship at Middle Tennessee State University.
