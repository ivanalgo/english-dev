JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A lawyer for a man accused of killing a Catholic priest has filed a rare legal request to have the case presented to a grand jury from outside the area where the slaying happened.
Jeremy Wayne Manieri is accused of killing the Rev. Ed Everitt of Hammond, La., last July but hasn’t been indicted.
Manieri’s attorney, Brian Alexander, filed a request Tuesday in Hancock County, Miss., Circuit Court for a change of venue for the grand jury. It’s not uncommon for lawyers to ask to move a trial to another county, but it’s rare to ask for a change of venue for a grand jury.
The motion says the area was saturated with news coverage and a campaign commercial for Attorney General Jim Hood, which called Manieri a cold-blooded killer.
