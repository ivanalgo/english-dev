PALLEKELE, Sri Lanka (AP) — Off-spinner Washington Sundar took two wickets in the opening four balls of the Super Over as India beat Sri Lanka in the third T20 to sweep the three-match series 3-0 on Tuesday.
Sundar’s double strike dismissed Sri Lanka for 2-2, and India scored 4-0 after skipper Suryakumar Yadav hit a four off the first ball of the Super Over bowled by Maheesh Theekshana. 
This was after Yadav had claimed two wickets in the 20th over as Sri Lanka fumbled a 138-run chase.
Rinku Singh and Yadav picked up four wickets for eight runs in their two overs of spin, with Sri Lanka collapsing to 137-8 in 20 overs. Together, the duo defended the nine runs needed by Sri Lanka off the last 12 balls of its innings.
Earlier, India scored 137-9 after losing the toss and batting first. Rain had delayed the start of the game.
With the series already settled, Sri Lanka made two changes and India four, with the fit-again Shubman Gill returning and both Hardik Pandya and Rishabh Pant rested.
The Indian top-order stumbled for the first time in the series. Theekshana (3-28) picked up two early wickets as India was down to 14-3 and then 30-4 in 5.4 overs. Gill held one end together with 39 runs off 37 balls, while Sanju Samson was out for a duck again.
Singh fell for one, while Yadav – batting lower at No. 5 – was out for eight.
Gill added 54 off 40 balls with Riyan Parag (26) and helped India past 100. Gill was out in the 16th over, with Sundar scoring an 18-ball 25 to help India post a defendable score.

        
    
In reply, Sri Lanka made a good start. In-form Pathum Nissanka scored 26 off 27 before he was caught off the bowling of Ravi Bishnoi (2-38).
The wrist spinner also trapped Kusal Mendis lbw, but not before the opener had scored 43. Nissanka and Mendis put on 58 for the first wicket, with the latter adding another 52 for the second wicket with Kusal Perera.
Perera scored 46 off 34 balls and Sri Lanka was cruising to victory at 110-1 in 15.1 overs, before the wheels came off in spectacular fashion.
India applied the choke with its unorthodox bowling changes and Sri Lanka collapsed from 117-2 to 137-8.
Sundar, who claimed 2-23 before his Super Over exploits, was named player of the match. 
Yadav, in his first outing as India’s new T20 skipper, was named player of the series.
“Recovering from 30-4, I thought 140 was a par score on that wicket. The boys showed character and I told them, if we showed heart, we could pull it off,” Yadav said. “The amount of confidence and skill in this team makes my job easy. I don’t want to be their captain, but their leader.”
India had already taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. 
It won the first T20 by 43 runs
 and 
the second match by seven wickets
. 
The two teams will also play three one-day internationals, starting Friday in Colombo.
