NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The Tennessee Titans will have yet another new kicker to open the season, placing Sam Ficken on injured reserve and signing Michael Badgley off the practice squad Saturday. 
Ficken hurt his right groin and was 
added to the injury report Friday
 when limited at practice. The Titans signed Badgley to the practice squad the same day. 
Now Ficken, picked up off waivers Aug. 1, is on injured reserve for at least three weeks. Badgley now will handle the kicking duties against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, and the Titans signed kicker Randy Bullock to the practice squad. 
This is the fourth straight season the Titans will have a different kicker for the opener. Ryan Succop, now with Tampa Bay, was the kicker to open the 2018 season. He was 
placed on injured reserve days
 before the 2019 season opener, replaced by Cairo Santos as the 
Titans used five kickers
 that season. 
 
Stephen Gostkowski
 was signed days before the 2020 opener, and now Badgley will be the kicker instead of Ficken. 
The Titans also promoted tight end MyCole Pruitt and safety Bradley McDougald from the practice squad for Sunday’s game.
