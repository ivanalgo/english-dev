URBANA — Former Kankakee Valley Park District Executive Director Roy Collins learns his fate today in U.S. District Court.
In September 2017, Collins pleaded guilty to federal mail and wire fraud charges for using district funds while he was director to purchase a liner for a fishing pond he had built at his former home in Kankakee and buying a pair of cowboy boots while on business in Nashville, Tenn.
Chief Judge of the Central District Court James E. Shadid is hearing the case.
In court documents filed ahead of today, Collins is asking for probation and to pay restitution. Collins is represented by Homewood attorney Gregory T. Mitchell.
Federal prosecutors are recommending a five-year prison sentence, three years probation and restitution.
Shadid denied Collins’ motion to withdraw his plea on Dec. 3, 2018. Mitchell argued false testimony was given by people involved in the investigation.
That motion was made at the conclusion of a sentencing hearing held on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, 2018.
The charges against Collins span from early 2012, when prosecutors allege unauthorized credit card purchases started, until early 2016, when prosecutors say Collins started creating false documents to conceal the theft from the Kankakee Valley Park Foundation.
Prior to becoming the district’s executive director in 2011, Collins was a park board member for four years.
Prosecutors were able to bring federal charges for mail fraud because Collins wrote a $3,008 check to Sky Group to purchase a pond liner for his home. The use of his park district credit card for a $234 pair of boots from Boot Country in Nashville, Tenn., gave prosecutors the ability to bring charges of wire fraud.
Collins now resides in Knoxville, Ill., where he works as a hotel manager, according to court documents.
