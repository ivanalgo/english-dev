MEXICO CITY (AP) — Tropical Storm Odile drifted northward Friday night after a brief stationary spin off Mexico’s southern Pacific coast, and forecasters said it could strengthen into a hurricane over the coming day.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Odile had maximum sustained winds near 65 mph (100 kph). Its center was about 205 miles (330 kilometers) south-southwest of Manzanillo and moving to the northwest at 3 mph (6 kph).
The center said the storm was likely to strengthen over the next 48 hours, possibly becoming hurricane on Saturday or Saturday night. It was predicted to remain well offshore through at least Sunday.
A tropical storm watch was in effect from Manzanillo north to Cabo Corrientes, and dangerous surf and riptides were forecast.
Tropical Storm Edouard was far out in the eastern Atlantic late Friday, and it was expected to remain out to sea and pose no threat to land in the coming days.
The hurricane center said Edouard, the fifth named tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, had sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph). It was centered 1,175 miles (1,885 kilometers) east of the northern Leeward Islands and moving west-northwest at 13 mph (20 kph).
