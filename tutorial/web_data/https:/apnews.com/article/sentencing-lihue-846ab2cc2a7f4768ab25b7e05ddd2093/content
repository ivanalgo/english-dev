LIHUE — Evan Craft entered a no-contest plea Wednesday before Judge Kathleen Watanabe to a manslaughter charge in connection to the death of Kauai man.
He is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 13, and faces up to 20 years in prison.
On June 1, 2015, witnesses saw Craft, 36, and Michael B. Helppie Jr., 37, appearing to argue outside of a tavern in the early morning hours. They proceeded to the jetty area by Kalapaki Harbor, and at some point Craft ran over Helppie with his car, killing him, according to a county press release.
Craft, originally of California, was arrested for manslaughter and operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant, and later indicted by a 5th Circuit Court grand jury on charges of second-degree murder and OVUII.
“Our thoughts remain with the ohana of Michael Helppie Jr.,” said Prosecuting Attorney Justin Kollar.
