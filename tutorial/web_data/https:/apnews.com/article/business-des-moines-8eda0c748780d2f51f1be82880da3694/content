 reported. According to a criminal complaint, Carothers admitted to deputies that he killed the rabbit, named Petunia.
Staff identified Carothers as being the last person in the shelter Sunday night. He was asked to leave and a short time later employees found the dead rabbit.
Deputies arrested Carothers about three hours later after he allegedly pulled a fire alarm at a Des Moines trucking company. He also was charged with trespassing at the trucking company.
Carothers was held at the Polk County jail. Online court records don’t indicate if he has an attorney who could address his charges.
