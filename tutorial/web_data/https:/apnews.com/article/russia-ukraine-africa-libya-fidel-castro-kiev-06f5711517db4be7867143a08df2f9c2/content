KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — NATO’s secretary general said Thursday that the military alliance will not intervene in the Libyan conflict and that any outside intervention should have a United Nations mandate.
“We have not received any requests in that respect. And anyway, any action should be based on a clear UN mandate,” said Anders Fogh Rasmussen, during a visit in Kiev, Ukraine.
Fogh Rasmussen said the events in Libya do not threaten any NATO members or allies, but the conflict could spark a mass refugee crisis.
The popular uprising in Libya has been violently suppressed, leading some to believe the country could be moving toward civil war.
In a column published Tuesday by Cuban state media, Fidel Castro alleged that NATO was planning to invade Libya.
