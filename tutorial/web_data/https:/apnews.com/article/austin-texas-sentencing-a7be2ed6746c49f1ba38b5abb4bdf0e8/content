AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A jury has sentenced a former Austin software engineer to death for the slaying of an Austin police officer.
A Travis County jury deliberated more than eight hours Friday before condemning Brandon Daniel in the April 6, 2012, death of Officer Jaime Padron (HEYE'-may pah-DRONE’).
The jury had the option of sentencing Daniel to life imprisonment without parole.
Daniel was sentenced one week after the jury returned a guilty verdict to his capital murder charge.
Padron was shot to death while answering a disturbance and shoplifting call at a Wal-Mart.
Daniel had acknowledged that he was under the influence of the anti-anxiety drug during the shooting.
