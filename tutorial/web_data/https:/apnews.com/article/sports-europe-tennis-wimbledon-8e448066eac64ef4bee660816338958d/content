WIMBLEDON, England (AP) — Andy Murray managed to overcome Ivo Karlovic’s hard serve for a 7-5, 6-7 (5), 6-2, 7-6 (4) win Thursday and reach the third round of Wimbledon.
Murray gave the home crowd at Centre Court some concern when he was broken in his first service game, but he held serve the rest of the way and broke Karlovic four times.
Murray again carries the hopes of the home nation that he can become the first British man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win Wimbledon. He’s reached the semifinals at the All England Club the last three years.
A day after Prince Charles made his first visit to Wimbledon since 1970, Kate Middleton’s sister Pippa sat in the Royal Box during the match.
