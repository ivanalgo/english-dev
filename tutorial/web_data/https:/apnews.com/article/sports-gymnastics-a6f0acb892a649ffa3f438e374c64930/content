Outrageous and despicable ...
These are the first words that came to mind when I learned of the sexual abuse of the female gymnasts at Michigan State University. This was monstrous. How could over 150 girls suffer sexual abuse for years, with it not being found out, and stopped? Where was the university, its gymnastics coaches, and university officials?
I have to believe that a formal investigation will be conducted. Had any of these gymnasts ever filed a claim with any university coach or official? It is difficult for me to believe that such a thing did not occur. If so, how was it handled, and by whom? Might charges of criminal neglect be appropriate? What will happen to the gymnastics coaches and related officials? What will happen to the gymnastics team?
The words despicable and outrageous do not apply just to the immediate university coaches and officials responsible. The president of the university has resigned. Who else must go? Are any criminal prosecutions appropriate? What kind of message is to be sent?
It is noteworthy that President Trump has not tweeted about this. He is quick to tweet about anything or anyone that is disagreeable to him, but he has not condemned this. Not totally surprising when you consider that he bragged about groping a woman by the crotch. What a despicable man. Then, what about our other government officials? What about our representatives and senators?
Is there any decency in Washington?
