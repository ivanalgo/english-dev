BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) â€” The sentencing hearing has been delayed for a Bloomington woman convicted of strangling her mother-in-law in 2011.
A jury in December found Misook Wang guilty of first-degree murder in the death of 70-year-old Wenlan Linda Tyda of Crest Hill in September 2011.
WJBC Radio (

 ) reports that Judge Robert Freitag has delayed the sentencing to March 1 after receiving a letter from Wang, who also goes by Misook Nowlin. In the letter, Wang alleges her attorney provided ineffective counsel during her trial.
Freitag has scheduled a hearing Friday to discuss that issue.
During her trial, Wang admitted paying someone to lure her mother-in-law to central Illinois with a job offer. But Wang said she choked her with a purse strap and sweater in self-defense during a struggle.
