PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Three teenagers were wounded by gunfire, one critically, near a school in Philadelphia as classes were ending Monday afternoon, police said. 
Authorities said the male victims, ages 15, 16, and 17, were shot at around 3 p.m. near Mastery Prep Elementary Charter School, which is on the same block as Simon Gratz High School in the Nicetown-Tioga neighborhood of north Philadelphia.
The 15-year-old was hit in the thigh and listed in critical condition at Temple University Hospital, police said. The 17-year-old was shot in the foot and was in stable condition, while the 16-year-old was grazed on an arm and declined medical treatment. No arrests were immediately reported.
Over the weekend, three teenagers were wounded by gunfire during a festival at the popular Penn’s Landing, a stretch of waterfront parks and eateries along the Delaware River in Philadelphia.
Police said another teenager was being sought in the gunfire that occurred shortly after 9:30 p.m. Saturday. Police said a 14-year-old male victim was shot in the ribs and two 14-year-old girls were both shot in the foot; all were reported in stable condition. A 14-to-15-year-old male shooter was being sought.
A total of six homicides were recorded around Philadelphia on Saturday and Sunday, as well as a triple shooting, a quadruple stabbing and a number of other shootings and stabbings.
