A Jackson Township man was sentenced Tuesday to 7 to 14 years in state prison for sexually assaulting a young boy on at least 10 occasions during the summer of 2013.State police said Robin Dewayne Roberts, 63, of 1555 Bristoria Road, admitted to them in August that he had fondled the boy when the child was 5 or 6 years old. The boy was interviewed by doctors who specialize in child abuse around the same time and the child told investigators about the encounters with Roberts.Police said they were alerted of the situation by Children and Youth Services through an anonymous tip.Roberts pleaded guilty Jan. 4 to involuntary deviant sexual intercourse with a child, sexual assault, incest of a minor, and 10 counts each of corruption of a minor, indecent assault and endangering the welfare of a child.Roberts had asked before his sentencing that he receive a mitigated sentence due to his multiple health problems, including Alzheimer’s and being on oxygen.Greene County Judge Lou Dayich said in his sentencing order that he understands that the sentence could have been mitigated."However,” he said in his order, “in looking at the nature of the offenses, the court is persuaded that nothing short of incarceration is justified in the matter."Dayich also said that the state Department of Corrections “should place, if available, the defendant in a facility that can address his medical needs."Roberts was given credit for 15 days served in jail and he will be required to register as a sex offender the rest of his life.
