CINCINNATI (AP) — A federal judge on Wednesday set final sentencing Dec. 15 for an Ohio man who falsely claimed to be a long-missing Illinois child. 
U.S. District Judge Michael Barrett early this year told Brian Michael Rini, now 25, that he must serve two years behind bars but that the judge also wanted to see results of a presentencing investigation before officially entering his sentence. Court records show the deadline for the investigation has been extended repeatedly during the pandemic. 
The report likely includes information about Rini’s mental and physical health. 
His attorney didn’t respond immediately to an emailed request for comment.
Rini, of Medina, Ohio, was arrested by FBI agents in April 2019. He pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft.
Rini signed a court document admitting that he claimed he was Timmothy Pitzen, an Aurora, Illinois, boy who disappeared at age 6 in 2011.
Rini had told authorities he had just escaped captors who sexually abused him for years.
When confronted with DNA results proving he wasn’t Pitzen, Rini said he had watched a story about Timmothy on ABC’s “20/20” and wanted to get away from his own family, the FBI said.
Rini’s DNA was already on file because of his criminal record. He served time for burglary and vandalism.
He twice portrayed himself in Ohio as a juvenile victim of sex trafficking, and in each case was identified after being fingerprinted, authorities have said.
