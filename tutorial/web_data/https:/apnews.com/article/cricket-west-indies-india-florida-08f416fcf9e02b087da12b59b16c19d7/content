LAUDERHILL, Fla. (AP) — West Indies ended India’s fightback in Florida and won their five-match Twenty20 cricket series 3-2 after an eight-wicket victory on Sunday with 12 balls left.
India, which lost the first two games of the series in the Caribbean, chose to bat first in the fifth T20 and scored 165-9 at Central Broward Stadium. In reply, West Indies reached 171-2 in 18 overs with both innings interrupted by bad weather.
West Indies opener Brandon King propelled the chase from the start. His 55-ball 85 not out included six sixes — one of which brought up his 50 — and five fours. King shared a 107-run stand with Nicholas Pooran (47) for the second wicket. 
Earlier, India’s openers failed to repeat their dominance from only 24 hours earlier at the same stadium in 
the fourth T20
, where they had a 165-run stand. This time Yashasvi Jaiswal (5) was out in the first over. He was caught and bowled by spinner Akeal Hosein (2-24), who then reduced India to 17-2 after Shubman Gill (9) was trapped leg before wicket. 
No. 3 Suryakumar Yadav top scored for India with a 45-ball 61. Fast-medium bowler Romario Shepherd took 4-31.
India was unchanged from the team that thrashed West Indies on Saturday by nine wickets. West Indies brought back pacer Alzarri Joseph and strengthened its spin options through Roston Chase with Obed McCoy and Odean Smith missing out. But Joseph was expensive. His three overs went for 41 runs with no wickets.
India won the 
third T20
 by seven wickets in Providence, Guyana, before the series moved to Florida. West Indies won the 
second T20
, also at Providence Stadium, by two wickets after the hosts also 
won the opener
 by four runs in Tarouba, Trinidad.
