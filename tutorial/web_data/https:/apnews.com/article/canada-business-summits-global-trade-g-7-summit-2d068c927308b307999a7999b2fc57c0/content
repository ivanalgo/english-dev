Donald Trump called out Canada’s trade policies towards the United States prior to the start of the G-7 summit on Friday.
The President began his morning tweet storm by criticizing tariffs placed on the US by our northern neighbor:
Canada charges the U.S. a 270% tariff on Dairy Products! They didnt tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2018
He continued over next hour to promote his agenda with foreign partners over the course of the week:
Looking forward to straightening out unfair Trade Deals with the G-7 countries. If it doesnt happen, we come out even better! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2018
I am heading for Canada and the G-7 for talks that will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the United States. From there I go to Singapore and talks with North Korea on Denuclearization. Wont be talking about the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax for a while! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 8, 2018
The president’s proposed tariffs and hard-line trade policies have concerned many both domestically and abroad. Thursday, French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Mr. Trump traded tough talk over trade tensions.
