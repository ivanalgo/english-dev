ST. LOUIS (AP) — A murder trial has again begun for a man accused of killing his ex-girlfriend and her mother and setting a fire that killed his own infant son. 
Jury selection began Monday in St. Louis Circuit Court in the trial of Eric Lawson, 32, who faces the death penalty if convicted, the The St. Louis Post-Dispatch 
reported
. 
Authorities 
have said 
 Lawson entered the apartment of his ex-girlfriend, 22-year-old Breiana Ray, in May 2012 and shot her and her mother, 50-year-old Gwendolyn Ray, each in the head, killing both women. 
Investigators say he then set two fires in the apartment and locked the door as he exited, trapping his 10-month-old son, Aiden, and a 3-year-old girl who was Breiana Ray’s daughter. The baby was found dead; firefighters rescued the girl, who suffered critical injuries.
It’s the second time Lawson’s case has come to trial. In 2019, prosecutors and defense lawyers were unable to seat a jury in the case.
