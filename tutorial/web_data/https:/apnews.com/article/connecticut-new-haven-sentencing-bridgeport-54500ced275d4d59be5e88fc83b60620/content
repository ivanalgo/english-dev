NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) — A Connecticut man nicknamed “Joe Crack” who has been imprisoned for more than a decade for drug dealing is asking a judge to resentence him to time served under a federal criminal justice reform law.
Joel Soto is set to be resentenced Monday in federal court in New Haven. Prosecutors say Soto’s 19-year prison sentence was warranted.
The 37-year-old former Bridgeport resident was among more than 40 people prosecuted in connection with a large cocaine and crack cocaine dealing operation in the Bridgeport area.
Soto was convicted of drug charges by a jury in 2010.
He is asking for a sentence reduction under The First Step Act signed into law by President Trump last year. The law gives judges more discretion in sentencing and eases mandatory minimum sentences.
