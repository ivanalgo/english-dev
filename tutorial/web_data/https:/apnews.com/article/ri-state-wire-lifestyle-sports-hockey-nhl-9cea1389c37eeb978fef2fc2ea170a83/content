ATTLEBORO, Mass. (AP) — A Rhode Island teen who suffered a severe spinal cord injury during a hockey game has graduated from his Catholic school in Massachusetts.
A.J. Quetta attended the graduation ceremony for Bishop Feehan High School in Attleboro on Friday and received a 
huge ovation
 as he received his diploma in a wheelchair.
The 18-year-old North Providence, Rhode Island senior crashed headfirst into the boards during a game against Pope Francis Prep in West Springfield on Jan. 26.
Quetta was rushed to a local hospital before being transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and then the Shepherd Rehabilitation Center in Atlanta, where he spent more than three months recuperating, WCVB-TV

He’s continuing his rehab at Journey Forward in Canton, Massachusetts and was recently feted by the Boston Bruin’s as their honorary banner captain during the opening game of their second-round playoff series against the New York Islanders at TD Garden.
Recently retired New England Patriots player Patrick Chung also helped organize the A.J. Quetta Golf Invitational in Sharon last month to benefit the teen’s family. The event was attended by a number of Boston sports luminaries.
