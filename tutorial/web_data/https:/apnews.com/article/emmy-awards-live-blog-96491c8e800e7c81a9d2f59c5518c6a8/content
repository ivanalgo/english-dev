Sorry, “Squid Game,” “Succession” once again took the best drama series Emmy.
“Evidently a little bit more voting involved in our winning than Prince Charles,” said showrunner Jesse Armstrong.
Star Brian Cox chimed in to “keep it royalist.”
“I’m not saying we’re more legitimate in our position than he is, I’ll leave that to other people,” Armstrong added.
He and his cast spent quite a long time hugging each other on stage before Armstrong realized that their time was running out and got to his speech.

11:00 p.m. ET – More from backstage
“I’ve been singing that song for years. I think of myself as an artist, as a woman, a woman of color. I’m an endangered species. I don’t sing any victim songs. I’m a woman. I’m an artist. It’s so many young actors, artists and even kids that think they know. Find your voice and put it where it belongs.”
Sheryl Lee Ralph spoke backstage about when she used to watch “Tinker Bell” on television and would say to herself: “I’m going to Hollywood, I’m going to Hollywood. I’m going to be an actress. I’m going to drive a Mustang. I’m going there.”
“The fact that I’m here, recognized after all this time as one of the best of the best in my industry with a group of women, they are all the best. And to top it off, this particular year, there’s tons of great TV. My little show to breakthrough and be seen the way it is, oh my God. I’ve got the golden ticket. Yes, I do. Where’s my chocolate? I’m ready.”
Long overdue?
“If this would have taken place any other time, it wouldn’t happen. But it happened right here, right now. In ‘Abbott Elementary’ at a time when the whole world and country needed a show they could look at, love it, laugh and plan their TV viewing around Wednesday nights.”

Smart also won out over Quinta Brunson for lead actress in a comedy series.
“I didn’t realize the breadth and appeal of our show,” Smart said, recounting a moment in a mall where several young boys shouted out her “Hacks” character’s name “Deborah Vance.” She told them they were too young to be watching the HBO Max comedy.

Emmy Awards: Stars look to keep cool on sweltering carpet
By LYNN ELBER
Emmy Awards host Kenan Thompson and the ceremony’s producers are promising a feel-good event. That description doesn’t apply to several of the top nominated shows. Among the best drama contenders at Monday night’s ceremony are the violently dystopian “Squid Game” and “Succession,” about a powerful and cutthroat family. Even comedy nominee “Ted Lasso,” the defending champ, took a dark turn last season. But after several pandemic-affected awards seasons, Emmy producers say the night will be big and festive.
