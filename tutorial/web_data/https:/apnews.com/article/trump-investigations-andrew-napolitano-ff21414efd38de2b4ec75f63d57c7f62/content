President Trump slammed his former lawyer Michael Cohen on Wednesday for recording a private conversation, since aired by CNN and suggested others may have been taped.
What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2018
CNN obtained and released the audio recording Tuesday night. It reveals then-candidate Trump and his lawyer at the time Mr. Cohen discussing buying the rights to Karen MacDougal’s story. Ms. McDougal allegedly had an affair with Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump’s current attorney Rudy Giuliani stands by the president and claimed the tape is muffled.
Based on the audio recording, Fox News’ legal analyst Andrew Napolitano said on “America’s Newsroom” that it seems civil fraud was committed, but Special Counsel Robert Mueller will have to make the determination if any election laws were broken. Mr. Trump should be worried, the Fox News analyst said.
“If there’s no attorney-client privilege then all his communications go straight to [Robert] Mueller,” Mr. Napolitano said.
