The National Medal of Honor Museum that’s planned near the aircraft carrier Yorktown at Patriots Point is getting a boost from five former U.S. presidents.
Former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama have signed on as honorary directors of the foundation that’s raising money to build the $100 million project, according to an announcement Thursday.
Mark Updegrove, the foundation’s CEO, said he personally visited with each of them except Obama to explain the vision for the museum. He got Obama’s support through his office and didn’t try to get Trump to sign on.
A 
new video
 that will appear on the museum’s website mentions the endorsement from the former presidents. The video also includes new renderings of the design and comments from Medal of Honor recipients Kyle Carpenter, Paul Bucha and Melvin Morris.
“This is a reflection of the best of who we are,” Updegrove says in a clip taken with the Yorktown in the background, “what it means to put something above yourself.”
The design was announced in 2015, and Updegrove was hired in February. It’s not been announced how much money has been raised so far.
