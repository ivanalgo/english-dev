Danielle Renae Perow, 29, 2729 S. Tamarac Dr., was sentenced to 11 months with four months up front in jail and one year, six months probation on a charge of uttering and publishing, in 51st Circuit Court Tuesday.
As part of her plea agreement, Perow had two additional counts of uttering and publishing and three counts of identity theft dismissed.
Perow had used a check stolen from her grandmother at Walmart in the amount of $80.86.
Perow will have to pay restitution in the estimated amount of $343.53 involving other stolen checks in the charges that were dismissed as part of the plea agreement.
The original incident occurred back in October of 2016 while she was on a delayed sentence for controlled substance offense out of Muskegon.
Mason County Prosecutor Paul Spaniola said he is concerned that Perow will turn back to drugs after being released from jail in the not-so-distant future. She has served 86 days of jail prior to her sentencing date.
Judge Susan K. Sniegowski said she has represented Perow in the past and believes that if she seeks treatment that she can get her life back on track.
“I know that miss Perow you have the ability to tackle your substance abuse problem if you have a desire to,” Sniegowski said.
