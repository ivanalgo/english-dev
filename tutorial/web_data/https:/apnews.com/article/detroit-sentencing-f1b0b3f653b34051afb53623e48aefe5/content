Marquise Cromer was sentenced Thursday to 40-75 years in prison for fatally shooting a Detroit police sergeant almost a year and a half ago.
Cromer shot Sgt. Kenneth Steil in the shoulder Sept. 12, 2016, while officers were searching for him in connection with the shooting of Cromer’s father and another man a day earlier. Steil died a few days later of his injuries.
During his sentencing, Cromer told the judge he was “hearing voices” when he shot the officer, adding: “I thought it was God, to be honest.”
Holding a rosary, Steil’s widow, Joann, spoke at the sentencing, telling Cromer, “Marquise, I forgive you because God forgives you.”
Police were searching for Cromer, 22, after he shot his father, 62-year-old Sterling Cromer and then another man during an attempted carjacking on Detroit’s east side. The elder Cromer said his son was at his home in 2100 block of Dickerson when the younger man came downstairs and shot him in the feet around 5 p.m. Sept. 11, 2016.
“I heard a loud pop sound,” Sterling Cromer testified during his son’s trial, which began last month “I glanced. (Marquise) tried to hide the sawed-off shotgun.”
Cromer’s attorney told jurors during the trial before Judge Shannon Walker of Wayne County Circuit Court that his client was mentally ill and tried to take his own life at the age of 9. Defense attorney Sanford Schulman said Cromer “was running away from the world” when the shooting of Steil occurred.

        
    
“There was no intent to murder a police officer,” Schulman told jurors in his opening statement during Cromer’s trial, where the defendant pleaded no contest but mentally ill to second-degree murder.
The plea came in the middle of his trial. As part of his sentence agreement, Cromer faced 38-75 years behind bars for second-degree murder. He will have to first serve a two-year consecutive sentence for a felony firearm violation.
Steil left behind two young sons. He was a 20-year veteran of the police force.
