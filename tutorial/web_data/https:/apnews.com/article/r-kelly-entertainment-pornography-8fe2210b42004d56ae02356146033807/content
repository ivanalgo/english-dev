CHICAGO (AP) _ The Illinois Supreme Court has denied news organizations’ emergency motion seeking sealed court records and transcripts related to R. Kelly’s pornography case.
The court denied the motion without comment Monday. The 41-year-old R&B singer’s trial is scheduled to start Friday.
The motion was filed by the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times and The Associated Press. A request by WBEZ to join the case was denied by the court as moot.
The news organizations wanted the Supreme Court to order the Cook County Circuit Court to unseal the records immediately.
Judge Vincent Gaughan (GAWN) has said he’s trying to protect Kelly’s rights and prevent information from influencing prospective jurors.
Kelly has pleaded not guilty to charges that he videotaped himself having sex with an underage girl.
