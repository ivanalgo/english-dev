ROME (AP) — Tour de France winner Vincenzo Nibali is being honored by Italy Premier Matteo Renzi.
Nibali presented Renzi on Tuesday with the yellow jersey that he won in Paris after a dominant victory earlier this year.
The cyclist says: “I hope we can do this again soon after another big win.”
Renzi recounted how he sent Nibali text messages during the Tour saying that he was waiting to receive him at the Premier’s office.
Renzi says: “All Italians are grateful for the emotions you stirred in us. You took the yellow jersey after the second stage, which was tremendous. And anyone who knows cycling knows that this gentleman had already won the Giro d’Italia and the Spanish Vuelta before taking the Tour.”
Nibali became the seventh Italian to win the Tour.
