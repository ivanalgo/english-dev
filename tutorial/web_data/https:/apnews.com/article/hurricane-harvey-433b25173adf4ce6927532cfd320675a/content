Tomball student’s book to help families affected by Harvey
After Hurricane Harvey brought record flooding that damaged businesses and homes in August, it inspired Landon Hayek to put pencil to paper and write a book about his experience along with his mother, Jennifer.
A fourth grader at Creekview Elementary School in Tomball ISD, Hayek said what he remembered the most during the storm was the wind and rain.
“My neighborhood just looked a little torn up because of the wind,” he said.
When he and his parents had to leave their home due to the rising floodwaters, they returned to a flooded home that is still undergoing repairs and replacing damaged items.
He said he remembered the way neighbors banded together after the waters receded and began helping each other by sharing food.
“Things are only things and you still have each other,” he said. “Not that they’re not important, but your friends and family are always more important.”
While schools were closed, he and his mother began writing and drawing what would eventually become the book “They Called Him Harvey: A Hurricane Harvey Story.”
The project took nearly two months to complete before finding a publisher and listing the book on Amazon.
Since the book has gone on sale, he’s read his book to classmates and done book signings. Part of the book sales will go to families who affected by Harvey, he said.
“It feels good to be able to read to the other students that have been affected because it helps me feel better and I try to make them feel better about what happened,” Hayek said.

        
    
While he enjoys writing, in the future Hayek said he hopes to be a meteorologist to be able to predict the weather, like The Weather Channel’s Jim Cantore or NBC’s Al Roker.
“If I can, I’ll do both - author and meteorologist,” he said.
In the meantime, he and his mom are brainstorming new ideas.
“Me and my mom are thinking about the next story that we want to write,” he said.
