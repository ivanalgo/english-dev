TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) — A mother who lost her five young children and boyfriend in a weekend mobile home fire was still in shock Monday, a family spokesman said.
Anna Angel, who was working at a fast-food restaurant Sunday morning when the fire broke out, is now faced with trying to make funeral arrangements for her children, said Keith Hodkinson, the family spokesman.
Investigators said Monday that they have finished going through the home in Tiffin, about 50 miles southeast of Toledo, but do not know yet what started the fire. They also were waiting on results of autopsies performed Monday.
A state investigator said Sunday there was no indication of anything suspicious.
Angel lived in the home with her five children, ages 2 to 6, and her boyfriend.
A funeral home identified the children Monday as Tiara Angel, 6; Stormie Huey, 5; Trinity Huey, 4; Sunshine Huey, 3; and Domonic Fresch, 2.
Hodkinson identified the boyfriend as 25-year-old Tim Fresch, of Tiffin.
A fund has been set up to help Angel pay for the funerals and replace her belongings lost in the fire. Some in the community have come forward to help with paying for cemetery plots and grave markers, Hodkinson said
“The only thing she had left was the Burger King outfit she was wearing,” he said.
A relative said Fresch was the father of the boy who died. The two oldest children were in kindergarten and first grade, said Owanna Ortiz, the woman’s cousin.

        
    
The family didn’t have a car and got around on bicycles, Ortiz said. Police and a neighbor said Angel raced home from work on her bicycle when she heard about the fire.
Fire officials said there was heavy fire in the center of the mobile home and heavy smoke throughout it when firefighters arrived. Witnesses said the fire burned quickly, breaking out windows and peeling some of the trailer’s aluminum siding.
