The music that changed America will bring back memories for those who grew up in the late 50s and will create new ones for younger people when the songs of Elvis Presley reverberate in the Neville Center for the Performing Arts at 7:30 p.m. on May 9.
Travis LeDoyt, featured in the New York Times as the “World’s Best Young Elvis,” will take the stage to present ”A Tribute to the King” in the last presentation of the North Platte Concert Association’s 2016-2017 season.
Corporate sponsor is the NebraskaLand National Bank.
Le Doyt looks like Elvis and wears appropriate outfits. Backed by a band of bass, guitar and drums, LeDoyt will sing the familiar songs that made Elvis famous, including “All Shook Up,” “Are You Lonesome Tonight?” “Blue Suede Shoes,” “Don’t Be Cruel,” “Fever,” “Heartbreak Hotel,” “Hound Dog” and “Love Me Tender.”
Born in the late 1970s LeDoyt is fast becoming one of America’s most convincing Elvis tribute acts. He captures the essence of Elvis in his prime, presenting the hits and ambiance of 1954-59. Over the years LeDoyt has also been recognized as a songwriter, performer, and singer.
