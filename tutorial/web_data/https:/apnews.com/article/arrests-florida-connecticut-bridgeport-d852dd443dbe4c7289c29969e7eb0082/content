BRIDGEPORT—The man suspected of murdering Cristobal Hernandez at a local restaurant last year was arrested Tuesday in Florida.
Police say that Douglas Rivas, 24, shot and killed Hernandez in the El Paraiso Restaurant on September 29, 2016.
“On April 25, 2017, (Rivas) was taken into custody in Sellsmere, Florida, and charged as a fugitive from justice,” said Bridgeport police Capt. Brian Fitzgerald, in a statement. “We expect that Rivas will be extradited back to Connecticut sometime in the near future.”
Detectives suspected Rivas from the date of the shooting, but his trail grew cold, according to Fitzgerald. U.S. Marshals assumed an interstate manhunt. Earlier this month, they received “new information” that led to Rivas’ arrest.
