A lawsuit says a woman’s brain injury from a headfirst fall at Dollywood was caused by a mix of sleet and rain that made a ride “dangerously slick” and a lack of adequate safety measures.
Tedi A. Brown and her husband filed the suit against the Tennessee theme park’s operators.
The suit says Tedi Brown suffered permanent impairments and disabilities after the Florida woman plunged from the Waltzing Swinger ride while on vacation with her husband and five of their children in December 2013.
Defendants are Herschend Family Entertainment Corp. and Dolly Parton Productions Inc. The suit says Herschend operates and manages the park at Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.
Dollywood spokesman Pete Owens says the park does not comment on pending litigation. He says the park looks forward to the matter being resolved.
