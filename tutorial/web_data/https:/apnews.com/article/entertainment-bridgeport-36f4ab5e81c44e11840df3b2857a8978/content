BRIDGEPORT—Missing the the silver screen of the now-defunct Bijou Theater?
The venue will open its doors Tuesday for a one-night run of The Armor of Light, a documentary film that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2015.
The documentary follows a pro-life evangelical activist and the mother of a gun violence victim as they explore the Christian base of pro-gun politics.
The film is being presented Connecticut Against Gun Violence, who plan to follow the screening with a panel full of household names.
Lucy McBath, featured in the film, spoke recently at the Democratic National Convention about the death of the shooting death of her son in Jacksonville, FL. She’ll be joined by U.S. Rep. Jim Himes and retired Bridgeport Police Chief Arthur Carter in the question-and-answer session.
Where: Bijou Theater, 275 Fairfield Avenue.
When: Reception at 5:45 p.m.; screening at 6:30 p.m.; panel at 8:00 p.m.
If you go: Seating is free but limited (same for parking at Broad St). Guarantee a seat by signing up online (fair warning, this will probably put you on a mailing list): http://bit.ly/2bjTWN3.
