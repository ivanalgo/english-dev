Connecticut residents have a chance to tell state parks and recreation officials what to do for the next five years.
On Thursday, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection released the final draft of the Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan.
The draft is open for public comment until Dec. 28.
In the draft, DEEP officials identified public transportation, restrooms, and water fountains as the weakest links in state parks services, citing a poll of 230 town officials.
But the goals identified in those polls do not match the priorities of all town leaders.
On Tuesday, officials approved including a $9.1 million build-out at Silver Sands State Park in Milford.
Local legislators opposed the move at a press conference, saying that permanent bathrooms and other infrastructure could lead to overcrowding. Some called for more money to be spent on lifeguards instead, noting that the beach has seen several drownings.
With state and local officials at loggerheads on some elements of the plan, it’s prime time for citizens to directly express their views.
“Public feedback is important to this process and we hope to hear from our natural resources and recreation stakeholders,” said Mike Lambert, DEEP Bureau Chief for Outdoor Recreation.
The full draft report, including an executive summary and a list of DEEP’s top five goals can be read on the agency’s website (http://bit.ly/2ixWZKv).
