NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — The New Jersey Devils have signed first-round draft pick Chase Stillman to a three-year entry-level contract.
General manager Tom Fitzgerald announced the signing Friday of the 29th pick overall in the draft.
New Jersey had two first-round picks and selected defenseman Luke Hughes, whose brother Jack plays center for the Devils, with the fourth pick overall.
Stillman played in Denmark this past season and had nine goals and seven assists in eight games. The 18-year-old went to Europe on loan from Sudbury when the Ontario Hockey League’s season was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The forward had 13 goals and 21 assists in 58 games for Sudbury in 2019-20.
Stillman’s father, Cory, was selected sixth overall in the 1992 NHL draft by the Calgary Flames and played 16 seasons in the NHL. The elder Stillman won Stanley Cup titles with Tampa Bay in 2004 and Carolina two years later. Chase’s older brother, Riley, is entering his second season with the Chicago Blackhawks.
