Former FBI Director James B. Comey said Sunday that President Trump is “close” to being considered an unindicted co-conspirator to Michael Cohen’s campaign finance violations.
“But if he’s not there, he’s certainly close given the language in the filing that the crimes were committed at his direction,” Mr. Comey said in an interview with MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace.
Mr. Comey said a typical private citizen implicated as Mr. Trump was in the documents “would be in serious jeopardy of being charged” by the authorities.
On Friday, federal authorities submitted documents showing Mr. Cohen, the president’s former “fixer” and personal lawyer, told investigators that hush-money payments to Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn star Stormy Daniels were directed and coordinated with Mr. Trump.
In August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple federal crimes, including campaign finance violation in connection to the payments.
Mr. Trump has denied that the payments amounted to campaign finance violation, describing them on Monday as “a simple private transaction.” He argued that if the payments crossed a line, it was Mr. Cohen’s fault.
“Lawyer’s liability if he made a mistake, not me,” the president tweeted.
Mr. Comey returned to CapitolHill on Friday to testify behind closed doors about decisions made by the FBI in 2016, which led up to the Russiainvestigation.
Mr. Trump took aim at the former FBI director on Sunday, accusing Mr. Comey of lying to Congress.
