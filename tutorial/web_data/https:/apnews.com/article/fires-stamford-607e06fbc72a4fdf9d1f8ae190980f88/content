Fire burned through the roof of a condominium at Waterside Green on Wednesday evening, but Stamford firefighters worked quickly to prevent the blaze from spreading through the complex.
Flames burned on all three floors and the attic of the condo unit at 1 Southfield Avenue, according to fire dispatch reports. It was largely under control around 8:15 p.m.
Fire glowed through the windows while firefighters trained heavy streams of water on it from above, from the bucket truck. The large, gray clapboard unit had the most damage to its left side. Most of it was spared heavy damage.
It’s unclear if anyone was inside when the fire broke out.
Video footage aired on social media, retweeted by the department’s official account, show a residence spewing a jet of flame and a column of smoke through the ceiling.
