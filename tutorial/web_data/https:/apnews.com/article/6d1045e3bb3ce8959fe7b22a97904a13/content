NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) — A high school student from China who fell ill at the Yale Model United Nations conference does not have the new virus that originated in China, a Yale spokeswoman said Friday.
The four-day conference on Yale’s Connecticut campus that draws about 1,800 students from around the world was supposed to end last Sunday, but instead all events were canceled after the student came down with a cough and a fever. 
The student was taken to Yale New Haven Hospital and tested positive for influenza. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked that the student be tested for the potentially deadly coronavirus.
That test came back negative, Yale spokeswoman Karen Peart said in an emailed statement. “We have shared this happy outcome with the student, their teammates and their advisors,” she said.
The student’s gender, age and hometown were not disclosed.
The pneumonia-like virus, first identified in Wuhan, China, has infected nearly 9,700 people and caused 213 deaths in that country as of Friday. Cases of the new virus have been confirmed in dozens of other countries, including six in the U.S.
