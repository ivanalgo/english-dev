George Conway, the husband of White House advisor Kellyanne Conway, blasted President Trump by starting the viral hashtag #DerangedDonald while commenting Thursday on a story about the president accusing the United Kingdom of espionage.
Mr. Trump furthered a two-year-old report resurfaced by One America News Network that the United Kingdom helped the outgoing Obama administration spy on Mr. Trump’s campaign; a day after he accepted an invitation to visit the Queen of England. Both the U.S. and Britain denied this claim.
“Deranged Donald is at back at it again. Deranged Donald can do things like this and it’s not even the top of the news, because it gets lost beneath all of the other deranged things Deranged Donald does. #DerangedDonald,” the conservative lawyer tweeted.
“Deranged Donald has this neat job where he’s supposed to receive and read books with more accurate, highly valuable, top secret information, but he doesn’t like those books unless they have lots of pictures and tell him how great he is. #DerangedDonald,” he continued.
“Plus Deranged Donald doesn’t really need all those books because Fox News. #DerangedDonald,” he finished, since his tweets, the hashtag has started trending on Twitter.
Mr. Conway and Mr. Trump have had Twitter beef previously despite Ms. Conway’s position within the White House.
In late-March, Mr. Conway tweeted Mr. Trump’s mental condition and psychological state was “getting worse.”
The president would later call him a “stone cold LOSER husband from hell.”
