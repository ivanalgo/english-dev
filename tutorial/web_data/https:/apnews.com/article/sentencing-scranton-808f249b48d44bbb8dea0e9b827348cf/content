The husband of execution-style murder victim Diana Algar exchanged a teary-eyed hug with the woman who adopted his wife’s killer on Monday morning before taking the stand and pleading for leniency for a teenage gunman he said is now “living for the Lord.”
Robert Algar Jr., of Scranton, told the judge who will decide the fate of Kenneth Carl Crawford III that he believes the man who robbed and murdered his wife of 13 years is now a repentant Christian.
Crawford has spent 17 years serving a life sentence after being convicted of first-degree murder for executing Algar and her friend Jose Molina during a robbery at her trailer in Hollenback Twp. in 1999. Because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling banning mandatory life sentences for minors, Crawford won a new sentencing hearing.
Despite the change of heart, prosecutors are still seeking two consecutive sentences of 35 years to life in prison for Crawford.
Testimony continues today.
