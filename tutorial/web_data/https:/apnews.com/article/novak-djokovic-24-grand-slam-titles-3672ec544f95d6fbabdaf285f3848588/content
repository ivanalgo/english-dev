NEW YORK (AP) — Novak Djokovic won 
his 24th Grand Slam title
 by beating Daniil Medvedev 
6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3
 in the U.S. Open final on Sunday.
That added to Djokovic’s record for the most major singles tennis championships won by a man — Rafael Nadal is next with 22; Roger Federer, who announced his retirement last year, has 20 — and broke a tie with Serena Williams for the most in the Open era, which began in 1968.
Like Djokovic, Margaret Court won a total of 24, but some of hers were earned during the sport’s amateur era.
Here is a look at each of Djokovic’s major championships so far — 10 at the Australian Open, seven at Wimbledon, four at the U.S. Open and three at the French Open — starting with the first:
Final: Beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (2)
What He Did: Eliminated Roger Federer in the semifinals, then didn’t face a break point in the second or third sets against Tsonga, before saving one in the fourth.
What He Said: “I’m very, very happy that I won my first Grand Slam here, so hopefully we’ll see you here on this stage a lot more often.”
Final: Beat Andy Murray 6-4, 6-2, 6-3
What He Did: Broke to end the first set with the help of a 38-stroke point exchange. Before the tournament, his rivals’ Grand Slam counts looked like this: Federer with 16, Nadal with nine.
What He Said: “I don’t want to fly up to the sky and say, ‘I am the best,’ or whatever. I cannot compare to Rafa and Roger’s success.”

        
    
Final: Beat Nadal 6-4, 6-1, 1-6, 6-3
What He Did: Became the first player other than Federer to defeat Nadal in a Slam final, and replaced Nadal at No. 1 in the rankings.
What He Said: “This is what I’m made for: I want to win. I’m a professional. I want to win more majors, more titles. Obviously, the U.S. Open is the next big thing.”

Final: 
Beat Nadal 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (5), 7-5
What He Did: Came out on top in a 5-hour, 53-minute marathon that was so exhausting, both men were given chairs to sit in during the trophy ceremony.

What He Said: “It was a long journey. I couldn’t pick a better place, to be honest, in the tennis world to peak and to make a comeback.”
Final: 
Beat Juan Martin Del Potro 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3
What He Did: Pulled even with his idol, Pete Sampras, at 14 major titles.
What He Said: “Maybe 10 years ago, I would say I’m not so happy to be part of this era with Nadal and Federer. Actually, today I am. I really am. I feel like these guys ... have made me the player I am.”
Final: 
Beat Nadal 6-3, 6-2, 6-3
What He Did: Thoroughly dominated Nadal, compiling 34 winners and making just nine unforced errors.
What He Said: “Under the circumstances, it was truly a perfect match.”

Final: 
Beat Daniil Medvedev 7-5, 6-2, 6-2

What He Said: “Most of my attention and my energy from this day forward, until I retire from tennis, is going to be directed (at) majors, trying to win more major trophies.”

What He Did: Pulled even with Federer and Nadal with 20 major titles.
What He Said: “I consider myself best, and I believe that I am the best, otherwise I wouldn’t be talking confidently about winning Slams and making history. But whether I’m the greatest of all time or not, I leave that debate to other people.”
Final: 
Beat Nick Kyrgios 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (3)
What He Did: Over the last two sets, accumulated 31 winners, made only eight unforced errors and faced zero break points.

Beat Tsitsipas 6-3, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (5)

Beat Casper Ruud 7-6 (1), 6-3, 7-5
What He Did: Djokovic broke his tie with Nadal at 22 majors and became the first man to have won at least three titles at each Slam event.
What He Said: “It’s not a coincidence that I won the 23rd Grand Slam here in Paris, because this tournament was the hardest one for me to win every day of my career.”
Final: 
Beat Daniil Medvedev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3
What He Did: At age 36, Djokovic became the oldest man to win the U.S. Open. He dropped only two sets in the tournament — both when falling behind Laslo Djere by two sets to none before coming back to win in the third round.
