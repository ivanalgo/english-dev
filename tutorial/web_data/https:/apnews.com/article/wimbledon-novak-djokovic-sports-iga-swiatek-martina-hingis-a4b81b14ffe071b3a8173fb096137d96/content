ANSWERS
1st Round. b. The oldest Grand Slam tennis tournament was first won by Spencer Gore in 1877, but the first women’s championship was not held until seven years later, when Maud Watson won her first of two consecutive titles. Men’s doubles was added in 1884, but women’s doubles — and mixed doubles — did not get added until 1913.
2nd Round. c. Hingis won 37 matches in a row until being beaten by Iva Majoli in the 1997 French Open final.
3rd Round. a. Since making his debut at Wimbledon in 1999, Federer has never missed the tournament until now (it was not held in 2020, when the All England Club canceled competition entirely because of the coronavirus pandemic).
4th Round. a. Sharapova was 17 when she won Wimbledon in 2004 for the first of what would become five Grand Slam titles during her playing career.
Quarterfinals. c. No one seems to know exactly why there is a pineapple atop the trophy, but according to the tournament’s official website, “pineapples were prized as a rare and exclusive food” in the latter half of the 19th century.
Semifinals. b. Coming off two championships in a row at the All England Club, Djokovic lost to Sam Querrey in the third round in 2016. Otherwise, Djokovic’s title defenses have gone this way: one semifinal defeat and four successful runs to another trophy.
Final. d. Serena Williams has 14 total trophies from the All England Club, and Venus Williams has 11. Serena’s collection: seven in singles, six in doubles (all with her older sister) and one in mixed doubles (with Max Mirnyi in 1998). Venus’ collection: five in singles, six in doubles. The siblings also were the singles runner-up four times apiece.
