THE PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP
Site: Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.
Course: TPC Sawgrass (Players Stadium). Yardage: 7,256. Par: 72.
Prize money: $25 million. Winner’s share: $4.5 million.
Television: Thursday-Friday, noon to 6 p.m. (Golf Channel); Saturday-Sunday, 1-6 p.m. (NBC).
Previous winner: Cameron Smith.
FedEx Cup leader: Jon Rahm.
Last week: Kurt Kitayama won the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
Notes: The PGA Tour’s premier event offers a $25 million purse, the richest in golf for stroke play. ... Defending champion Cameron Smith is not playing because the PGA Tour suspended him for joining Saudi-funded LIV Golf. The runner-up (Anirban Lahiri) and third-place finisher from last year (Paul Casey) also joined LIV. ... The field features every PGA Tour member from the top 50 in the world ranking. ... No one has ever won back to back at The Players Championship. ... Seventeen players who made the cut last year at The Players are now with LIV Golf. ... The winner gets $4.5 million, which is more than the entire purse from 25 years ago. ... Tiger Woods has decided not to play, meaning he likely won’t be seen again until the Masters. ... This is the final event for players to qualify for the 64-man field at the WGC-Dell Match Play in two weeks. Because of LIV defections and those not playing, it could dip down to the high 70s in the ranking to get in. ... The winner gets a three-year invitation to the majors. ... Woods, Jason Day and Greg Norman are the only players to win The Players Championship as No. 1 in the world.
Next week: Valspar Championship.

Prize money: $2 million. Winner’s share: $333,333.

Race to Dubai leader: Victor Perez.
Last tournament: Marcel Siem won the Hero Indian Open.
Notes: This is the start of a two-week South Africa swing for the European tour. ... The field has only three from the top 100 in the world. ... The tournament is being held for the fourth time. ... The field includes Laurie Canter, who played as a reserve for two-time major champion Martin Kaymer at the first LIV Golf event in Mexico two weeks ago. ... Shaun Norris is in the field. The big South African signed with LIV Golf last year and played a full schedule. He was among the 48 players this year. ... Marcel Siem plays for the first time since winning the Indian Open, his first European title in more than eight years. ... Adrian Otaegui is in the field and might be able to shore up a spot in the WGC-Match Play with a good result. The 64-man field is likely to go down to near 80th in the world ranking. At No. 82, he is the highest-ranked player in the field.
