R. Kelly’s musical accomplishments have been accompanied by a long history of allegations that he sexually abused women and children. Now the R&B singer 
has been sentenced
 to spend the next three decades behind bars.
A jury found Kelly 
guilty in September of sex trafficking
 charges. While Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, has vehemently denied the allegations, his accusers testified in detail that he subjected them to perverse and sadistic whims when they were underage.
Kelly still faces 
a trial in Chicago
 on charges of child pornography and obstruction of justice.
