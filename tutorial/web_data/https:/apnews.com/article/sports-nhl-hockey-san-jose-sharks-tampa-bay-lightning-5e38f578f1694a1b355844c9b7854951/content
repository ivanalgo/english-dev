NEW YORK (AP) — Forward Barkley Goodrow, who just finished helping the Tampa Bay Lightning win consecutive Stanley Cups, has signed a six-year contract with the New York Rangers.
General Manager Chris Drury announced the signing on Thursday, less than a week after acquiring the rights to the unrestricted free agent from the Lightning for a seventh-round draft pick in 2022.
Goodrow skated in 55 games with Tampa Bay this past season, collecting six goals and 14 assists along with a team-best, plus-16 rating. The 28-year-old, who can play the wing or center, also led the Lightning in hits (111).
In the postseason, Goodrow had two goals and four assists in 18 games, adding 68 hits. He is also an outstanding penalty killer.
Goodrow has played 331 career NHL games over parts of seven seasons with San Jose and Tampa Bay, registering 32 goals and 61 assists. He has won 52% of his career faceoffs.
Prior to joining the Lightning, Goodrow helped the Sharks advance to the Western Conference final in 2018-19. He had the game-winning goal in overtime in Game 7 of the Sharks’ opening-round series against the Vegas Golden Knights that postseason.
