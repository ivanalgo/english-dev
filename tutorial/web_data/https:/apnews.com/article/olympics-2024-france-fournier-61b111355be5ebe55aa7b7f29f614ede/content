PARIS (AP) — Evan Fournier was wide open at the top of the key late in the fourth quarter, a shot that would have clinched a trip to the semifinals of the 
Paris Olympics
 for France. The ball felt good leaving his hand, and he was a bit surprised when it rimmed out.
Turns out, something better awaited.
Fournier wound up making a 40-footer on the same possession to beat the shot clock — providing the exclamation point in 
France’s 82-73 win over Canada
 in the men’s basketball quarterfinals on Tuesday night.
“The shot just before was a stepback on (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander), like right in the middle and I thought it was in,” said Fournier, who finished with 15 points. “The shot felt so good, I thought that if I have another chance, I’m just going to shoot it. And so, I had a nice opportunity, the ball went in, the crowd went crazy and that was good.”
Taken out of the starting lineup for the game — he and Rudy Gobert, who barely played at all Tuesday, were both swapped out by France coach Vincent Collet — Fournier took over when it mattered most. He scored 12 points in the final 3:48 for France, which will play Germany in the semifinals on Thursday.
And the 40-footer sealed matters.
Jamal Murray turned the ball over for Canada, down by seven with 1:46 left. France wound up getting Fournier the straightaway 3 that he missed, then after an offensive rebound Victor Wembanyama missed another 3, and after yet another offensive rebound, Wembanyama threw the ball out to Fournier with the shot clock close to expiring.
The heave went, and France — silver medalists in Tokyo three years ago — will play Thursday for a spot in the gold-medal game.
“Just trying to make plays to help the team,” Fournier said.
