MICHIGAN CITY – Chavez Garrett, who shot a man in the head in May 2016, was sentenced to 10 years in prison Thursday.
Judge Michael Bergerson in La Porte Superior Court No. 1 ordered that all 10 years be fully executed in the Indiana Department of Correction; but said Garrett may petition the court after eight years to modify his sentence so the remainder might be served on probation.
The 10-year sentence was the maximum allowable by the plea agreement Garrett reached with the state in November, which called for him to plead guilty to level 3 felony aggravated battery. The other charges he faced – attempted murder and pointing a firearm, felony levels 1 and 3, respectively – were dismissed upon his sentencing.
Bergerson said Garrett’s cooperation with police and prosecutors benefited his eligibility for a plea agreement. However, a presentence investigation shows Garrett is at high risk to reoffend, leading the judge to choose the maximum-allowed sentence.
As aggravators, Bergerson cited Garrett’s juvenile adjudications for battery, resisting law enforcement and disorderly conduct; his adult convictions for criminal mischief, battery and possession of a handgun without a permit; and the fact that he was on probation at the time of the May 2016 shooting.
Additionally, the judge reminded Garrett that one of the bullets he shot remains lodged in the victim’s head, causing ongoing physical suffering and other problems.

        
    
Garrett, now 25, shot into a vehicle then-20-year-old Dionte Peterson was driving in the 1100 block of Providence Street on May 31. One bullet hit Peterson in the head; but he survived the shooting.
A relative of the victim testified in April that Peterson continues to suffer anxiety, pain, dizziness and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the shooting.
