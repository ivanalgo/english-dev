EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) — The sentencing of a former East St. Louis police detective on cocaine-related drug charges has been delayed until next month.
Forty-two-year-old Orlando Ward pleaded guilty in November to conspiracy to distribute cocaine and to possessing the drug with plans to deal it.
The Belleville News-Democrat (http://bit.ly/1eoS31U) reports that a judge has rescheduled Ward’s sentencing, originally to take place Thursday, for May 9.
A federal prosecutor has described Ward in court as a corrupt police officer who for $5,000 a month was willing to provide information, police protection and resources to the drug conspiracy.
Ward resigned from the East St. Louis Police Department in May of last year after a dozen years on the police force.
He is free on bond.
