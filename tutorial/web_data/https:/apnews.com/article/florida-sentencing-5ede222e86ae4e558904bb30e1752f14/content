MIAMI (AP) — Sentencing has been delayed for a man convicted in South Florida of supporting terrorists in a case where an undercover FBI agent used Internet chats to pose as a financing middleman.
U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro on Friday postponed sentencing until November because 31-year-old Gufran Mohammed raised objections about his lawyer. Mohammed faces up to 15 years behind bars after pleading guilty of conspiring to support the al-Shabaab terror group in Somalia and al-Qaida in Iraq.
Mohammed is a naturalized U.S. citizen from India. He was arrested last year in Saudi Arabia following numerous online contacts with the undercover FBI employee.
Co-defendant Mohamed Hussein Said of Kenya has pleaded not guilty, with trial set in May. He’s accused of identifying recruits for a Syrian terrorist group and helping finance al-Shabaab.
