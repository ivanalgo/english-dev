LOS ANGELES (AP) — Placido Domingo’s contract as general director of the Los Angeles Opera has been extended through the 2018-19 season.
The 73-year-old tenor became artistic consultant to the company in 1984 and was artistic director from 2001-03 before becoming general director. His previous contract was announced in September 2010 as a deal running through 2013 that would renew automatically by mutual consent.
Domingo sings the baritone part of Giorgio Germont in Verdi’s “La Traviata” this month, his 26th role with the company.
The LA Opera’s board of directors announced the extension Friday, when it also extended the deal of chief executive officer Christopher Koelsch through June 2018 and promoted John Nuckols to executive vice president with a contract through June 2018.
Music director James Conlon’s deal previously was extended through June 2018.
