SYDNEY (AP) — Injured Australia cricket captain Michael Clarke unwittingly became involved in a controversial decision in his bid to play in the first test against India beginning on Dec. 4.
The captain of Clarke’s Western Suburbs grade cricket club, Jeff Cook, declared his team’s innings closed at 17-0 against Parramatta at Kings Oval in Sydney on Saturday.
Clarke, who has been hampered by a left hamstring tear sustained in the summer’s opening one-day international against South Africa, had no chance of playing, and was nominated for only the second day of the match next weekend.
New South Wales Cricket said it was “conscious of the need to maintain the integrity” of the competition and will investigate Cook’s decision.
Cook says “all I wanted to do was the best for Michael Clarke and Australia.”
