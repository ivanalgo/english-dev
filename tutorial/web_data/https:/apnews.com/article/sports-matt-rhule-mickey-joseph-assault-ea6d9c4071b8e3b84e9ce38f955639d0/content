LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Mickey Joseph, Nebraska’s interim football coach for nine games this season who was charged with felony assault, is no longer part of the Cornhuskers’ program, the athletic department announced Friday.
The department said in a statement it would have no additional comment.
Joseph is accused of putting his hands around a woman’s throat, pulling her hair and punching her during a 
domestic dispute Nov. 30, according to a police affidavit.
 He was charged on Dec. 1 with assault by strangulation or suffocation.
Joseph was placed on administrative leave after his arrest. He denied to police that he assaulted the woman. His next court appearance is Jan. 30.
Joseph’s arrest came two days after Matt Rhule was introduced as the new head coach.
It was unclear whether Joseph received severance pay. He was under contract through Dec. 31, 2023, and his annual salary was listed at $600,000.
Under terms of the contract, he could be fired for cause if convicted of a misdemeanor or felony that impaired his ability to perform duties on behalf of the university. If a firing for cause is upheld, the university would not have to pay the remaining money owed on the contract.
