A group of United States senators on Wednesday proposed a bill in the name of a slain correctional officer from Nanticoke that would give federal prosecutors a second chance at sentencing a killer to death if an initial jury is deadlocked.
The bill is named “Eric’s Law” in memory of Eric Williams, 34, who was murdered by an inmate who stabbed him more than 200 times and repeatedly stomped his head in February 2012 at United States Penitentiary at Canaan.
A jury last year convicted the inmate, Jessie Con-ui, of murder, but deadlocked on whether to sentence him to death due to one hold-out juror. Con-ui, an Arizona gang assassin already serving 25 years to life for a previous murder, was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, thinks the penalty was a miscarriage of justice. He and three colleagues proposed the bill to change sentencing procedures in federal death penalty cases.
Currently, prosecutors in federal death penalty cases cannot impanel a second jury for sentencing if the initial jury fails to reach a unanimous decision on a sentence. Eric’s Law would allow, but not require, prosecutors to impanel a second jury in these instances. The bill is modeled after state laws in California and Arizona.
The proposed legislation mirrors a bill touted last year by U.S. Reps. Lou Barletta, R-Hazleton, and Tom Marino, R-Lycoming Twp.

        
    
“Officer Eric Williams’s life was senselessly cut short by a violent gang assassin. His murderer essentially received no punishment for his crime, even though 11 out of 12 jurors voted for the death penalty, because he was already serving a life sentence,” Toomey said in a statement. “The lack of any consequence in this case highlights a flaw in our justice system that this legislation will address.”
Con-ui, 41, is jailed at United States Penitentiary at Florence, a supermaximum security prison in Colorado.
