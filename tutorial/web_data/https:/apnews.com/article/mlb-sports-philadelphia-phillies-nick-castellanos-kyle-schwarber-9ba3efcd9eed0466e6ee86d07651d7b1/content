CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) — Kyle Schwarber and the Philadelphia Phillies finalized their $79 million, four-year contract on Sunday.
Schwarber gets $19 million this year and $20 million in each of the following three seasons.
A 29-year-old slugging outfielder, Schwarber split last season with Washington and Boston. He hit .266 with 32 home runs and had a grand slam for the Red Sox in the AL Championship Series.
Schwarber will likely serve as the Phillies’ designated hitter, with time in the outfield and first base as well. 
Philadelphia also has a pending $100 million, five-year contract with free-agent slugger Nick Castellanos, who hit .309 with 34 homers, 100 RBIs and a .939 OPS last year for the Cincinnati Reds.
