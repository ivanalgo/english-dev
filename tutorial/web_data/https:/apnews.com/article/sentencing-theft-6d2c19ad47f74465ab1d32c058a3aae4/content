GREENWICH — A man described as a “career criminal,” one who was responsible for at least 15 burglaries and one home invasion in Greenwich was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
Jerome Shaw, 57, of Inwood, New York City, had pleaded guilty to interstate transportation of stolen property; conspiracy; and receipt and sales of stolen property.
“He was a prolific burglar. Through a lot of hard work and old-fashioned investigation, we were able to identify a suspect and bring a case against him,” commented police Lt. John Slusarz.
Greenwich police worked with the FBI in making the arrest against Shaw. Besides the burglaries and one home-invasion, police said, Shaw was also responsible for the theft of a vehicle in Greenwich. A home invasion involves a perpetrator breaking into a house with people in it and a confrontation.
Police said Shaw stolen millions of dollars in property, and he was required to make restitution of $4.7 million, under terms of his sentencing.
