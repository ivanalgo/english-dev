Michigan State University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, where convicted child molester Larry Nassar was employed for nearly two decades, is preparing to hire an interim dean for the school.
Andrea Amalfitano, director of MSU’s Clinical Sciences Institute, has been named interim dean designee, pending approval by the university’s Board of Trustees at a meeting scheduled for Feb. 16.
William Strampel, who had been dean of the college since 2002, announced last month he was taking a leave of absence for medical reasons, the university said.
Strampel has been named in lawsuits filed against MSU and Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting girls and young women during medical treatment.
A Detroit News investigation found that Strampel was one of at least 14 staff members at MSU who received reports of sexual misconduct by Nassar in the two decades before the former sports doctor’s arrest.
Among those notified was MSU President Lou Anna Simon, who was informed in 2014 that a Title IX complaint and a police report had been filed against an unnamed physician. She has faced growing calls to resign, including from top state lawmakers and university trustee Mitch Lyons.
