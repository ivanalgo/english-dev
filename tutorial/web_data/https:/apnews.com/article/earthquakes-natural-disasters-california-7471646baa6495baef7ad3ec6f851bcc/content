RIO DELL, Calif. (AP) — A moderate New Year’s Day earthquake rattled the region of Northern California where a stronger quake nearly two weeks ago killed two people and left widespread damage, authorities said.
The earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.4 struck at 10:35 a.m. Sunday about 9 miles (14 km) southeast of Rio Dell in Humboldt County, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. 
A dispatcher with the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office said there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage from Sunday’s shaker. 
Rio Dell was the epicenter of a magnitude-6.4 earthquake on Dec. 20 that killed two people, injured more than a dozen others, shook homes off foundations, damaged water systems and knocked out power to thousands.
