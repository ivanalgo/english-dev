MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian state medical official says “fecklessness” by bureaucrats was to blame for a bobsledder failing a doping test at the Pyeongchang Olympics.
Nadezhda Sergeeva was disqualified from the games after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine.
She was the second Russian to fail a test at the games — where she finished 12th — and her case played a role in Russian athletes not being allowed to march under their own flag at the closing ceremony.
Vladimir Uiba, the head of Russia’s Federal Medical-Biological Agency, tells Russian media his agency tried to bar Sergeeva from competing because of a heart condition, but Sports Ministry officials let her travel.
He says “organizational fecklessness” led to Sergeeva’s mother, a doctor, giving her unapproved medicine containing trimetazidine.
