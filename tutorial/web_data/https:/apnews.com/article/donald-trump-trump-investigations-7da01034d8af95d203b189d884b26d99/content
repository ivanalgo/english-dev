President Trump slammed Michael Cohen as a liar Wednesday ahead of his former lawyer’s testimony to Congress in which he plans to call the president a racist and a “con man.”
“Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately),” Mr. Trump tweeted. “He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time.”
Cohen, who faces three years in jail for lying to Congress and tax evasion, says in prepared testimony that he is ashamed of committing crimes on behalf of Mr. Trump.
“He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat,” Mr. Cohen will say, according to his prepared remarks.
The president, who is meeting in Hanoi with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, also said Cohen is “Using Crooked’s lawyer!” It’s a reference to Hillary Clinton’s former lawyer, Lanny Davis, who is working with Cohen.
