CHICAGO (AP) — A suburban Chicago man described by federal prosecutors as an organized crime enforcer was sentenced Wednesday to 15 years of prison for being a felon in possession of a firearm.
Mario J. Rainone of Addison was found guilty of the gun violation in February.
A search warrant was issued for Rainone’s apartment after his arrest in February 2009 for an alleged residential burglary and an outstanding retail theft warrant. The search uncovered a .357-caliber revolver in a bedroom nightstand. It was determined the gun was stolen in October 2008.
In sentencing Rainone, U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber told the balding, gray-haired man that normally, a 60-year-old person would be thinking about other things than committing crimes.
Before his sentencing, prosecutors detailed Rainone’s use of violence and threats against those who owe debts to organized crime figures. Assistant U.S. Attorney Amar Bhachu told Leinenweber that Rainone’s violent activity should be held against him, arguing for a sentence of up to 24 years.
After the sentencing, Rainone attorney Joe Lopez said he was happy the judge gave Rainone the lowest sentence possible.
