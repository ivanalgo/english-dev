PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A police officer was wounded by gunfire and two other officers were hurt in a crash after a shooting that left a resident injured and the suspect with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said.
All three officers were discharged from hospitals Wednesday after treatment following the series of events that began with a report of an armed robbery Tuesday night. Police said an officer was interviewing the alleged robbery victim when the suspect was spotted. 
The officer approached the suspect, who shot the officer twice in the shoulder, police said. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that surveillance video shared by neighbors showed the suspect shooting without warning from several feet away before fleeing.
The suspect then ran into a backyard and, as police surrounded the area, fired into the home, wounding the homeowner, police said. As officers closed in, the suspect “shot himself in the head,” according to the police commissioner, Danielle Outlaw. 
A police vehicle transporting the suspect to a hospital later crashed, injuring two officers, police said. All three officers were discharged Wednesday and the homeowner was reported in stable condition. Authorities said the suspect was in crtical condition.
The police commissioner said she was disgusted and called the situation “unimaginable.”
