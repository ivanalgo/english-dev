OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A Marine from Nebraska who was killed in Afghanistan in a suicide bombing earlier this year was honored during the Omaha Lancers’ Military Appreciation Night. 
The family of Marine Cpl. Daegan Page was on hand Friday night to drop the puck for the start of the Lancers game against the Sioux Falls Stampede, which the Lancers won 5-2. 
“This is Daegan’s people, right?” Page’s mother, Wendy Adelson, told 
station WOWT
. “I think if he’s looking down on us, and I believe he is, he probably has this huge goofy grin and there’s probably crazy things coming out of his mouth because first of all, I’m standing here wearing this jersey.”
Page, of Omaha, was an avid hockey fan who played throughout his childhood and was a member of the 2016 state champion Westside Warriors hockey team. Page was one of 13 U.S. service members killed Aug. 26 in the bombing at the Kabul airport, which also killed at least 169 Afghans. 
His family said Friday that the outpouring of support from the community has brought them peace over the past few months.
