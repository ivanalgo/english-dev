KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) — Former President George H.W. Bush is remembering his wife, Barbara Bush, on what would have been her 93rd birthday.
He tweeted Friday from his summer home in Maine about how she liked to help others, and he thanked those who are carrying forward her work.
“She loved helping others and did so with a joyful heart. Knowing there are so many out there who share her passion puts joy in our hearts,” he wrote.
Her daughter-in-law, Margaret Bush, marked the occasion by doing something Barbara Bush enjoyed: She read aloud to young patients at The Barbara Bush Children’s Hospital at Maine Medical Center.
She joined in cutting a birthday cake after reading “One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish” by Dr. Seuss and “Circus Ship” by Chris Van Dusen.
In Kennebunkport, the Bush family had a quiet dinner at home. Former President George W. Bush, the couple’s son, was among the participants.
Sending our gratitude and family love on this special day to all who are helping carry forward the selfless work of one Barbara Pierce Bush. She loved helping others and did so with a joyful heart. Knowing there are so many out there who share her passion puts joy in our hearts.

The two were married for 73 years. Barbara Bush died April 17 with her husband at her side in their home in Houston.
