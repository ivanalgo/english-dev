LONDON (AP) — Olympic champion Andy Murray continued his perfect start to Wimbledon with a straight-sets victory over Tommy Robredo to reach the fourth round of the grass-court Grand Slam tournament on Friday.
Playing under the retractable roof on Centre Court because of persistent rain, Murray was in control throughout and advanced with a clinical 6-2, 6-4, 7-5 win.
The second-seeded Murray, who missed the French Open because of a back injury, has yet to lose a set at the All England Club this year. He warmed up for Wimbledon by winning at Queen’s Club.
After losing to Roger Federer in the final last year, he is again bidding to become the first Briton to win Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936.
