CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Hundreds of shelter animals from coastal South Carolina have arrived in Delaware ahead of Hurricane Dorian’s expected landfall.
The News Journal of Wilmington 
reports
 the animals were moved from shelters at risk of flooding. The Category 3 storm began making its way across 
the Carolinas
 Thursday and was expected to flood low-lying areas and bring enough rain to cause flash flooding concerns well inland.
Nearly 200 animals were airlifted off the endangered coast and picked up by Brandywine Valley SPCA early Tuesday. About 150 other animals were expected to arrive that night via land transport from Best Friends Animal Society. The animals may be up for adoption throughout New England later this week.
Brandywine says the lessened South Carolina shelter populations will make space for local pets impacted by Dorian.
