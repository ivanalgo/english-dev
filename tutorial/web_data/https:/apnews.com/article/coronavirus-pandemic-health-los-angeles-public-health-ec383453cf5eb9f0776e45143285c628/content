LOS ANGELES (AP) — The New Year’s Eve party planned for downtown Los Angeles’ Grand Park will not have an in-person audience due to the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in LA County, organizers said.
The 
 “NYELA Countdown to 2022”
 event will instead be streamed, as it was last year.
Organizers originally planned to have an invite-only audience of LA County frontline workers and first responders. 
The program will feature the band Kinky and other musical performances starting at 11 p.m. on Dec. 31.
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health reported more than 3,500 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday as the number of daily new cases tripled over the week.
