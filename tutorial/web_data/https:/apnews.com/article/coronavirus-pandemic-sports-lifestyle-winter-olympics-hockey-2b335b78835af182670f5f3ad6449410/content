LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) — The Empire State Winter Games will return in February after a one-year hiatus caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The amateur winter sports competition will be held Feb. 3-6. Organizers expect around 2,000 athletes to participate at venues in Lake Placid and the surrounding Adirondack region.
“I’m excited that we’ll be able to have a full program,” Ashley Walden, CEO of the Adirondack Sports Council, said in a release. “Sports are very important towards the development of youth, and this is a highlight for young aspiring athletes, across the state and beyond.”
