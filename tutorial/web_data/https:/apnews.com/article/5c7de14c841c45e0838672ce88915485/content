MILFORD—The man found dead in his apartment after an 8-hour standoff Friday morning has been identified by police as Ronald Schiraldi, 49.
Police had contacted the man, and enlisted his sister to try and talk him down, Hearst Connecticut Media reported Friday.
The response shut down the area around 25 High Street, across from the Milford Lisman Landing Marina and the Milford Historical society, until around 8:30 a.m.
Residents of Schiraldi’s third-floor apartment were evacuated, and others in the 28-unit complex were warned that he was armed.
New details of the standoff emerged Tuesday.
Schiraldi died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said following an autopsy.
Police did not hear the gunshot, Milford Police Department spokesman Mike DeVito said.
It’s unclear how long Schiraldi was dead before police broke down the door. An investigation is ongoing.
The apartment door had been locked, not barricaded, as police initially said. Police also corrected the age of the man, who was initially said to be 50 years old.
