Corinth man will serve five years on a sexual battery charge. Shawn Jones, 35, of West Harris Circle, pleaded guilty to the charge last week in Alcorn County Circuit Court during a plea day, according to court records. Judge Jim Pounds suspended 20 years of a 25-year sentence, leaving five years to serve day-for-day with no early release, followed by five years of probation. He must register as a sex offender and was ordered to have no contact with the victim or family of the victim. Other sentences handed down on guilty pleas include: • Nekia Williams, 33, of Lamar Road, Ashland, sexual battery of a child under 14 — Williams entered an Alford plea of guilty, which allows the defendant to maintain his innocence despite the plea. Sentencing in the case was delayed until July 19. He was arrested by Corinth police in January. • Justin Lee Plunk, 29, exploitation of a child — Plunk also entered an Alford plea. Sentencing was delayed until Aug. 8 in Prentiss County. • Angie Sorrell, 36, possession of cocaine — Suspended eight-year sentence and five years of probation • Lisa Dianna Wilbanks, 28, two indictments for felony fleeing — Suspended five-year sentences and four years of probation • Shyneice Simmons, two indictments for felony shoplifting — Suspended three-year sentences and probation totaling five years.
