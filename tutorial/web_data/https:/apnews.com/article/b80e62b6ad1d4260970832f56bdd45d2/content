Ten years ago: Savoring his first big victory in Congress, President Barack Obama used his weekly radio and Internet address to celebrate the just-passed $787 billion economic stimulus bill as a “major milestone on our road to recovery.” Jazz drummer Louie Bellson, who’d performed with Duke Ellington and Bellson’s late wife, Pearl Bailey, died in Los Angeles at age 84.
Five years ago: Drawing a link between climate change and California’s drought, President Barack Obama said the U.S. had to stop thinking of water as a “zero-sum” game and needed to do a better job of figuring out how to make sure everyone’s water needs were satisfied. An attempt by the United Auto Workers to organize employees at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, fell short in a 712-626 vote.
