MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — As it prepares for the holiday season, the New Hampshire Food Bank says supply chain issues and rising costs have impacted food deliveries, but the organization is managing, with the help of monetary donations.
“The supply chains are not quite back to what they used to be,” Elieen Liponis, executive director, 
told
 WMUR-TV. “They are not as bad as the height of the pandemic, but we are experiencing some delays, some shortages here and there. But we adjust weekly, daily.”
She said the food bank is a bit low on produce and protein, but expects the supply chain will fulfill them soon.
Liponis said the cost of fuel also gets transferred to the price of the product, but “We locked in our prices and our turkeys in January, so we are very fortunate and we do plan ahead significantly.”
The food bank distributed over 17 million pounds of food last year.
