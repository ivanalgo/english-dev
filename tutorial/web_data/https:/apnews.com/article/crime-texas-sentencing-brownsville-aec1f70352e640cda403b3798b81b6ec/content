A member of a Texas prison gang who flashed a pistol in a rap video posted on Facebook has been sentenced to a little more than seven years in prison for being a felon in possession of a firearm.
Rafael Gandaria, 29, of Brownsville, pleaded guilty to the charges on Sept. 20, 2017.
The U.S. District Attorney’s Office, Southern District of Texas, announced in a press release that the sentence was necessary to protect the public from Gandaria’s future crimes.
During the Wednesday sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge Rolando Olvera heard testimony that Gandaria is affiliated with Partido Revolucionarios Mexicano, a prison gang in South Texas and Mexico, according to the USAO.
During the hearing, Olvera heard testimony from Gandaria’s extensive criminal history, which includes simple battery in Georgia in 2005; attempted robbery in Brownsville in 2007; assault on a public servant in Brownsville in 2011; evading arrest in Brownsville in 2011; resisting arrest in Florida in 2013; and possession of a controlled substance in Minnesota in 2014, according to the USAO.
CameronCounty court records show that Gandaria appeared before Olvera in 2011 when the federal judge was still a state district judge.
Olvera sentenced Gandaria to two years in prison for assault on a public servant and court records show that Gandaria appeared before Olvera in at least one other case.

        
    
During his sentencing on Wednesday, the federal judge also heard testimony about how the man displayed violent behavior while incarcerated on the firearms charge, including violence toward jailers while being detained and in his transportation to and from jail for court settings, according to the USAO.
Before sentencing Gandaria, Olvera noted that the man lacked remorse, the USAO said in a press release.
