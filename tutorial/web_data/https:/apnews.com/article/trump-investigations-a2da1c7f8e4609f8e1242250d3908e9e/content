Rep. Mark Meadows immediately demanded postponing the public testimony of President Trumps former fixer, Michael Cohen, kicking off the highly anticipated Oversight Committee hearing off on a contentious note.
The North Carolina Republican said lawmakers were not given enough time to review Cohenâ€™s submitted testimony and accused Cohen and his attorney, Lanny Davis, of deliberately withholding his prepared statement so Republicans couldnt view it.
When you were in the minority you wouldnt have stood for it and we shouldnt stand for it as a body, Mr. Meadows told Rep. Elijah Cummings, Maryland Democrat and House Oversight Committee Chairman.
Rep Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, also jumped in, saying that the opening statement was leaked to CNN.
The motion was defeated.
