The Justice Department is preparing to announce charges in connection with the hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014.
A U.S. government official familiar the criminal case says authorities will charge a North Korean who’s believed to have operated out of China. Authorities have said previously that North Korea was responsible for the cyberattack.
