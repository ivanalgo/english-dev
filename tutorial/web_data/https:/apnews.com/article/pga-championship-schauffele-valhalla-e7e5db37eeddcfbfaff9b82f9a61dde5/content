LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — THE VICTOR: Xander Schauffele made a 6-foot birdie on the last hole for a 6-under 65 to win his first major championship.
THE SPOILS: Schauffele earned $3,330,000, moved to a career-high No. 2 in the world and secured his spot in the Olympics in Paris this summer.
THE RECORD: Schauffele finished at 21-under 263, the lowest score in major championship history. He also is the first player to finish a major at 21 under.
THE RUNNER-UP: Bryson DeChambeau played bogey-free for a 64.
THE CONSOLATION PRIZE: Thomas Detry birdied two of his last three holes for a 66 and wound up in a tie for fourth. That gets him into the Masters for the first time next year. He also moved into the top 60 in the world and is exempt for the U.S. Open.
SHOT OF THE DAY: Alejandro Tosti chose to hit driver to an island green on the par-4 13th. His 338-yard drive settled 7 feet away for eagle.
LONG WEEK: Scottie Scheffler arrived as a new father, was arrested and briefly jailed for not following directions of police who were investigating a fatal accident involving a pedestrian before his second round, closed with a 65 and tied for eighth.
KEY STATISTIC: Americans now have won the PGA Championship nine straight years, their longest streak since they won every PGA in the 1980s.
NOTEWORHTY: Schauffele is the first PGA champion since Phil Mickelson in 2005 to birdie the final hole for a one-shot victory.
QUOTEWORTHY: “I just kept telling myself, ‘I need to earn this. Earn this and be in the moment.’ And I was able to do that.” — Xander Schauffele.
NEXT YEAR: The PGA Championship goes to Quail Hollow in Charlotte, North Carolina.
