Sydney’s S&P ASX 200 added 1.7% to 6,476.10 following a shock victory for Prime Minister Scott Morrison. His conservative, pro-business government looked set to form a majority government, leaving bewildered voters wondering how they were taken by surprise since the opposition Labor Party had been expected to win.
Voting in India’s election, which lasted more than five weeks, ended with exit polls predicting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party and its allies will win another five years in office.
The election was seen as a referendum on Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, whose main opposition is the Congress party, led by Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has produced three prime ministers.
The outcome appeared to please investors, as the benchmark Sensex added 3.8% to 39,352.67.
