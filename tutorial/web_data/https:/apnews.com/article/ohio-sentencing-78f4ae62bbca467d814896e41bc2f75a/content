Eastlake man convicted of raping two girls, faces max sentence of life in prison
PAINESVILLE, Ohio – An Eastlake man convicted in the rape of two girls now faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Brian A. Rowe, 36, was found guilty Wednesday of two counts of rape and one count of gross sexual imposition, according to court records. The girls are sisters; one was under 10 years old and the other was under 13 years old when the rapes happened, prosecutors said in court records.
Judge Vincent A. Culotta will sentence Rowe on Dec. 4 in Lake County Common Pleas Court. Ohio sentencing guidelines call for a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
Rowe’s attorney, Brandon J. Henderson, could not be reached for comment Friday.
The trial began Oct. 23 and lasted five days, Culotta’s bailiff said Friday afternoon. Jurors deliberated for more than two days before they returned a guilty verdict on the three charges.
The rapes happened between Oct. 1, 2014 and Aug. 1, 2015 in Wickliffe, according to the indictment in the case. Rowe is an acquaintance of the girls’ mother, court records show.
Rowe was indicted in secret Nov. 11, 2016 and arrested three days later, records show.
