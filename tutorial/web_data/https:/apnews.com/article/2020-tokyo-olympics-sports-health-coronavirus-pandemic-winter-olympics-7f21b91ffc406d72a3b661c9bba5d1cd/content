CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Troy Ryan has been named head coach of Canada’s women’s hockey team for the 2022 Beijing Olympics.
“It is an honor and privilege to be entrusted with this leadership opportunity,” Ryan said Thursday in a statement.
Ryan has Olympic experience. He was an assistant for Laura Schuler at the 2018 Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, where Canada lost the final to the United States in a shootout. He also was an assistant coach to Perry Pearn at the 2019 world championship in Finland, where Canada took bronze, and was named Canada’s head coach for the world championships in both 2020 and 2021. Those tournaments were canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ryan’s assistants will be Kori Cheverie, Jim Midgley and goaltending coach Brad Kirkwood. Doug Derraugh will serve in a coaching staff support role through the 2020-21 season.
“With limited time for competition, our coaching staff has bonded quickly, which is what we need in both short-term and long-term competition,” said Gina Kingsbury, Hockey Canada’s director of women’s national teams.
