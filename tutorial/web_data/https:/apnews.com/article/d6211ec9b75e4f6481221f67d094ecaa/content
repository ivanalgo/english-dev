CHICAGO (AP) — The man who pleaded guilty to introducing a Chicago teenager to a pimp before she was murdered has been sentenced to seven years in prison.
Charles McFee, who was charged with trafficking, admitted to selling 16-year-old Desiree Robinson for $250 to Joseph Hazley, who marketed her for sex on Backpage.com. Robinson was murdered on Christmas Eve 2016, authorities allege, by a man who responded to the ad.
During his sentencing hearing Thursday, the 27-year-old McFee said he wasn’t thinking of the consequences of his actions, adding he was “young and dumb.”
In addition to the seven years, U.S. District Judge Sharon Coleman added five years of supervised release upon McFee’s discharge from prison.
A federal jury convicted the 35-year-old Hazley in March of trafficking the girl. He was sentenced last week to 32 years in prison.
