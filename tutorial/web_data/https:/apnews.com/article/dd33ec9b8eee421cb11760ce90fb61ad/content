CHICAGO (AP) — The Latest on the sexual abuse case against R&B singer R. Kelly (all times local):
3 p.m.
Lawyer Michael Avenatti says it’s “outrageous” that R. Kelly’s attorney questions whether the singer’s accusers are telling the truth about being sexually abused by the R&B singer.
Avenatti, who says he represents 
two Kelly victims
 and gave prosecutors new video evidence of Kelly having sex with an underage girl, said Saturday that, “We’re going to do everything in our power ... to make sure 2019 is not a repeat of 2008.”
He 
was referring
 to Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial, in which the singer was acquitted.
Kelly’s lawyer, Steve Greenberg, said Saturday after a judge set Kelly’s bond at $1 million that Kelly “is a rock star. He doesn’t have to have nonconsensual sex.”
Referring to the #MeToo movement, Greenberg said, “Unfortunately, there’s this whole hashtag movement. Just because someone says something now ... it doesn’t make them credible.”
2 p.m.
R. Kelly’s lawyer rejects the allegations that the R&B singer sexually abused anyone, telling reporters: “He is a rock star. He doesn’t have to have nonconsensual sex.”
Greenberg made the comments Saturday after a judge set a $1 million bond for Kelly, who 
was booked Friday
 on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four females, 
including three
 who were underage at the time.
Greenberg says he’s happy with the bond amount, but Kelly doesn’t have much money because he says mismanagement by others put the singer in financial straits.

        
    
He says Kelly is trying to get the bond money together and hopes to get out of jail later Saturday.

The lawyer for R. Kelly says any sexual contact between the R&B singer and the four people he’s charged with sexually abusing might have been consensual..
Steve Greenberg made the comment to reporters Saturday after a judge set Kelly’s bond at $1 million. But he says he hasn’t seen any evidence yet.
Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx says the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.
Kelly was tried and acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 and has consistently denied any sexual misconduct. The 52-year-old Grammy winner’s lawyer said Friday that he’s confident Kelly will be vindicated.

A prosecutor told the judge at R. Kelly’s bond hearing in Chicago that the singer met one of the four people he’s charged with sexually abusing during his 2008 child pornography trial.
The prosecutor says the two met when he gave her an autograph, and that she was underage at the time.
Kelly was acquitted at that trial, which stemmed from a video purported to show him having sex with an underage girl as young as 13.
The prosecutor says Kelly sexually abused the girl he met during the trial between 2009 and 2010.
