As Connecticut black bears wake from hibernation, officials are reminding residents to lock up the animal’s preferred foods.
“If you genuinely care about bears, you should never feed them - either intentionally or unintentionally,” said Susan Whalen, Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Deputy Commissioner, in a release Monday.
Easier said than done. There’s a lot that bears like to eat, from table scraps to pet food. DEEP officials recommend an audit of residents’ outside areas.
Take down bird feeders and lock trash cans. Clean outdoor grills and keep meats and sweets out of compost piles. To keep bears away from livestock, bee hives and berry bushes, DEEP suggests electric fences.
Monday’s announcement followed the death of a black bear in Meriden last week after it was struck by a car, according to myrecordjournal.com.
“Bears become habituated, losing their fear of humans, when attracted to homes by easily-accessible food sources,” Whalen said. “Such bears spend more time in neighborhoods and near people, increasing public safety fears, and the likelihood that the bears may be hit and killed by cars or meet with some other misfortune.”
The black bear population recovered significantly in the 1980s after being nearly wiped out during the 1800s, according to DEEP. Last year, residents in 134 of the state’s 169 towns reported more than 6,700 bear sightings to the agency’s Wildlife Division.
