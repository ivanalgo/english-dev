OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — At least one person in Oklahoma has died due to COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, after the person received the coronavirus vaccine, deputy state epidemiologist Jolianne Stone said Friday.
“We are still doing an investigation on that particular case,” and no other information was immediately available, Stone said.
More than 2.5 million vaccinations have been administered in Oklahoma, according to data from the Federal Centers for Disease Control. 
Stone said 137 people in Oklahoma have contracted coronavirus after being vaccinated and nine have been hospitalized. 
The state health department reported 446,550 total cases and 8,206 deaths, based on death certificates provided to the CDC, increases of 304 cases and nine additional deaths since Thursday.
The rolling average of daily new cases has declined from 586.5 on April 7 to 236.6 on April 21, a decrease of 59.7%, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
There were 97.8 new cases per 100,000 people in Oklahoma during the past two weeks to rank 48th in the country for new cases per capita, according to the Johns Hopkins data.
