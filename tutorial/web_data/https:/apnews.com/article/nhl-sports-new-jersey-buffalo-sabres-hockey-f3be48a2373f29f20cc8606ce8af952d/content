NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Pavel Zacha scored at 3:09 of overtime to give the New Jersey Devils a 2-1 victory over the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday night.
Nico Daws stopped 24 shots to win in his NHL debut, and Nico Hischier had a power-play goal for New Jersey.
“We got off to an early deficit, and at that point my job was to just give the team a chance to win,” Daws said. “Try to stop every puck I have and help the team.”
Dylan Cozens scored a power-play goal for Buffalo, and Dustin Tokarski made 37 saves.
“Our goalie was the freshest guy in the game, and he looked like it,” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “Clearly he had fresh energy, and he did what he should’ve done. He did a hell of a job for us.”
Hischier tied it at 5:52 of the third period, tipping Dougie Hamilton’s errant shot past Tokarski. New Jersey has scored power-play goals in consecutive games after starting the season 0 for 5 with the man advantage.
“Obviously, it feels good,” Hischier said. “But at the end of the day, it helps the team. It feels good for you, obviously, but I always say, somebody else scores, it’s a goal, too, so it’s just huge we got that win coming from behind and still get those two points.”
Cozens opened the scoring at 3:19 of the first. After linemate Jeff Skinner drew a holding penalty on Devils defenseman Jonas Siegenthaler, Cozens ripped a snap shot over Daws’ blocker.
Daws stopped the final 22 shots he faced, also getting help from the post during the first period when Buffalo forward Vinnie Hinostroza struck the crossbar and left post on a shot attempt.
Sabres: Host Tampa Bay on Monday night.
Devils: Host Calgary on Tuesday night.
