WASHINGTON (AP) — Iran’s foreign minister says his country is willing to forgive the United States’ history with Iran but will not decades of distrust between the two nations.
Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif (jah-VAHD’ zah-REEF’) says Tehran is open to negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program, but Washington must end its crippling sanctions. Zarif says Iran is not developing a military nuclear program and has no desire for one.
Zarif also says Iran is willing to open its nuclear facilities to international inspectors.
The foreign minister’s comments follow a sudden thaw in U.S.-Iranian relations after decades as adversaries. President Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke Friday by telephone, the first direct contact between the two countries’ leaders in three decades.
Zarif spoke Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”
