PARIS (AP) — Moments after the 
opening ceremony
 for the Rugby World Cup, French President Emmanuel Macron was jeered by fans at Stade de France when he walked onto the field.
Chants of “Allez Les Bleus” rang out around the stadium but some of the jeering continued, before other fans broke out into spontaneous chants of the national anthem, “La Marseillaise.” 
Macron, whose 
unpopular pension plan
 has led to social tensions, stood with his arms folded and applauded World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont after he finished his speech.
When it was Macron’s turn to speak, the boos became even louder and he was barely audible at first. The crowd cheered in unison only at the end when Macron declared the 10th edition of the tournament open.
The opening ceremony was performed under the directorial supervision of Oscar-winning French actor Jean Dujardin. He walked out in a sleeveless white T-shirt suited to the sweltering conditions. 
The ceremony was a celebration of French gastronomy, culture and art. It featured leaping acrobats, a giant scrum with dozens in fancy dress, and a massive inflatable Eiffel Tower which rose in the middle of the field.
At one point, Dujardin was hoisted aloft above it.
The performers went off to a standing ovation, but the mood turned sour quickly when Macron walked out.
France and New Zealand met in the opening match afterward.
