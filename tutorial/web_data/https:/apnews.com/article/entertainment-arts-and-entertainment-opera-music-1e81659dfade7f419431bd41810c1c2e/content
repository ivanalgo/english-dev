CLAREMONT, N.H. (AP) â€” The city of Claremont is planning a June celebration of 125 years of arts and entertainment since the dedication of its City Hall and Opera House building. 
A committee is planning to expand the Claremont Oral History Project, originally published in 1981 as a collection of 41 recorded interviews of former residents. 
A grant will fund the writing of stories about some of the interviews. The stories will cover events at the opera house, the dance pavilions, and the movie theaters. 
The stories will be published in June in both print and eBook format.
