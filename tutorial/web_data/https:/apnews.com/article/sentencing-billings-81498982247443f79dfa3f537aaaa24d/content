A judge sentenced a man to life in prison for the repeated rape of a teenage girl.
Kenneth Wayne Jones, 42, was placed in state custody after a sentencing hearing on Thursday in Yellowstone County District Court. Jones lived in the Billings and Roundup areas, as well as in Arkansas.
District Judge Rod Souza also issued a sentence of 10 years for a felony count of tampering with witnesses and informants, which runs concurrent to the sentence for Jonesâ€™ rape conviction.
Billings police first received a report of the rapes in 2016. The victim reported multiple sexual and violent abuses by Jones that first started in 2014, according to court documents. The girl was 14 at that time.
After his arrest, Jones pleaded not guilty in July 2016. His case went to trial in February, when he was found guilty on both counts.
