A 19-year-old Longmont man who pleaded guilty to attempted sexual assault and other charges was sentenced to seven years in prison on Friday.
After release from the Department of Corrections, Abel Rivera will spend 10 years in the Sex Offender Intensive Supervision Program, according to Boulder County District Attorney’s Office spokeswoman Catherine Olguin.
Rivera pleaded guilty on Oct. 24 to second-degree burglary, second-degree assault and criminal attempt to commit sexual assault.
The amended complaint says that prosecutors believe that on or about June 28 to June 29, 2016, Rivera entered a Longmont house with intent to commit sexual assault.
His co-defendant, Jarrett Reid, is scheduled for sentencing in February .
They were both arrested last December .
According to an arrest affidavit — which names both Rivera and Reid — a female told police she woke up to Rivera having sex with her in a bed and she told him to stop at least twice. She said Rivera left and then Reid started kissing and touching her sexually.
One witness told police he heard a rumor at the party that a female was raped. He said Rivera and Reid told him they didn’t do it, but he wasn’t sure whether to believe them.
