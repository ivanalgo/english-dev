The University of Wisconsin women’s hockey team will start the NCAA tournament in the same place in the national rankings it has occupied all season.
The Badgers were a unanimous No. 1 in the USCHO.com Division I women’s poll on Monday after winning the Western Collegiate Hockey Association Final Face-Off title on Sunday.
UW defeated North Dakota on Saturday and Minnesota-Duluth on Sunday in Minneapolis for its third straight league playoff title.
The Badgers, No. 5 Minnesota and No. 7 Cornell are the only three teams that didn’t change spots in the USCHO rankings this week.
No. 2 Clarkson and No. 3 Minnesota-Duluth swapped spots from last week. Boston College moved up two spots to fourth.

UW, which has held the No. 1 spot all season, hosts No. 8 Robert Morris at 2 p.m. Saturday in the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament. That game sold out in fewer than three hours after tickets went on sale to the general public Monday morning.
The winner goes to the Frozen Four in St. Charles, Missouri, March 17-19.
