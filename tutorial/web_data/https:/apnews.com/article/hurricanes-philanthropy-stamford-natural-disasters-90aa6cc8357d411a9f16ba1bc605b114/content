STAMFORD — Local fire fighters will raise money Sunday for the victims of recent hurricanes.
The Stamford Professional Fire Fighters Association, IAFF Local 786 and the Stamford Fire Department will host a full slate of fundraisers.
The first is “Fill the Boot,” happening from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. at the intersections of Shippan Avenue and Magee Avenue at the entry to Shippan Point and further north at Cold Spring Road and Long Ridge Road in Bull’s Head.
The second event, which kicks off at 12:30 p.m., features a DJ, food and drink specials and a raffle at 6 Harbor Point Road. All of the proceeds from the event will go toward hurricane relief efforts.
Funds collected will be distributed through Stamford-based AmeriCares, the Salvation Army and the IAFF Fire Fighter Disaster Relief Fund.
“All of us were deeply affected by the wave of multiple recent natural disasters striking other parts of our nation,” Brendan Keatley, President of the Stamford Professional Fire Fighters Association said in a statement. “On Sunday, members of the Stamford Fire Department are hoping the Stamford community will turn out in force, stand shoulder to shoulder with us to raise desperately needed funds to aid so many victims whose lives have been devastated. The people of Stamford can certainly understand the suffering, given disasters striking our community in recent years. Whatever generosity and support Stamford citizens offer is truly needed and welcome.”
