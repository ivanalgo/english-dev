LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) — The first parkour world championships organized by the governing body of gymnastics was postponed a second time because of the coronavirus pandemic on Thursday.
The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) 
cited “current travel restrictions and difficulties”
 for the championships not taking place from March 26-28 in Hiroshima, Japan.
No new date was suggested for an event originally scheduled in April last year.
FIG has faced 
resistance from national parkour bodies
 worldwide while trying to establish control over the street-running sport.
The gymnastics body hoped to organize a recognized world championships as a step toward gaining Olympic recognition. FIG’s request to add parkour to the 2024 Paris Games was 
declined by the International Olympic Committee 
 last month.
