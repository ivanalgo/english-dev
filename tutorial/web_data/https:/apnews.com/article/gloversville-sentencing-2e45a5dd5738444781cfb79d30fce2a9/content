JOHNSTOWN — A Gloversville man was sentenced Tuesday to 3? to 10 years in prison for killing a passenger in his car in a high-speed crash, Acting Fulton County District Attorney Chad Brown said.
Michael Mach, 64, was sentenced by Fulton County Judge Polly Hoye for his April 21 guilty plea of felony manslaughter.
Mach admitted to driving his 1968 Chevrolet Corvette recklessly on Aug. 26 on Route 146, Brown said. Mach and his passenger, Joseph Christman, 42, were southbound when Mach lost control and rolled the car into a ditch, killing Christman, according to a report by the Fulton County Express. The men were not wearing seatbelts, State Police said.
A toxicology report showed Mach had a 0.23 percent blood alcohol content, the DA said.
During his sentencing, Mach read a prepared statement expressing his remorse to Christman’s family and friends.
