President Trump and one of his top lawyers said Saturday that special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s court filings still haven’t tied the president to any collusion with Russia.
Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said on Twitter that Mr. Mueller’s “late Friday dump demonstrates yet again no evidence connected to President.”
He added that the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York is asking for a four-year prison term for former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen “because as we have said he’s still lying.”
Federal prosecutors said Friday that Mr. Trump directed illegal payments through Cohen to hush up potential sex scandals that threatened his chances of winning the White House in 2016. For the first time, the Justice Department implicated Mr. Trump in the alleged campaign finance violations, in which the president is referred to as “Individual 1.”
The president didn’t address the hush-money payments Saturday, focusing on the Russia investigation.
“AFTER TWO YEARS AND MILLIONS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS (and a cost of over $30,000,000), NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump tweeted.
He said it is “Time for the Witch Hunt to END!”
Federal prosecutors said Cohen should serve a “substantial” prison term for tax evasion and paying hush money to the two women. But the highly anticipated court filings did not include evidence that Mr. Trump colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election.

        
    
The government did disclose that a Russian national claiming to have ties with the Kremlin contacted Cohen in November 2015, offering the Trump campaign political and business “synergy” with Moscow, a contact that was earlier than previously known. The person offered to arrange a meeting with Mr. Putin; Cohen did not follow up with the individual.
