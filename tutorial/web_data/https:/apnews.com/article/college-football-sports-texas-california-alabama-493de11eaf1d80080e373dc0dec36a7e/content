Tennessee quarterback Hendon Hooker
 is the Southeastern Conference offensive player of the year and Alabama linebacker 
Will Anderson Jr.
 was named the top defensive player for the second straight year.
Tennessee coach Josh Heupel
 was picked as coach of the year by the Associated Press Monday after keeping his team in playoff contention for much of the season. The sixth-ranked Volunteers are 10-2 and face No. 10 Clemson in the Orange Bowl.
Mississippi freshman 
running back Quinshon Judkins
 was named newcomer of the year, edging LSU linebacker Harold Perkins Jr. Judkins led the SEC with 1,476 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns.
Hooker was picked as first-team quarterback and offensive player of the year on all but one ballot, with that nod going to Alabama’s Bryce Young in both cases. He suffered a 
season-ending left knee injury
 in a loss to South Carolina, finishing with 3,135 yards passing and 27 touchdown passes against just two interceptions.
Anderson was the unanimous pick as defensive player of the year. He has 51 tackles, 10 sacks and 17 tackles for loss along with a pick-six.
Other unanimous picks were Tennessee wide receiver Jalin Hyatt, Georgia tight end Brock Bowers and running backs Judkins and Raheim Sanders (Arkansas).
Heupel received six coach of the year votes to edge 
LSU’s Brian Kelly
 (five), who led the Tigers into the SEC championship game in his first season. Georgia’s Kirby Smart (three) and South Carolina’s Shane Beamer (one) also received votes.

        
    
The voting was conducted among a panel of 15 sports writers and broadcasters covering the league.
