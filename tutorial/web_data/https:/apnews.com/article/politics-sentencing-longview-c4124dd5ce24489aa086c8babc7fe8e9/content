LONGVIEW, Wash. (AP) — A historic hotel owner has been sentenced to 90 days in jail for intimidating the Cowlitz County judge who was presided over his DUI case.
The Daily News of Longview reports that a jury convicted 51-year-old Phil Lovingfoss earlier this month for threatening District Court Judge Ed Putka a year ago. The judge heard his March 2015 DUI and hit-and-run case.
Prosecutors had argued for a 13-month sentence at Tuesday’s sentencing hearing. They say Lovingfoss was drunk but coherent when he told police dispatchers that he would take his 35-carat diamond ring and backhand Putka, among other threats.
Defense attorney Jim Morgan argued for a shorter sentence, saying Lovingfoss planned to continue alcohol treatment and mental health counseling.
Lovingfoss owns the Monticello Hotel in Longview.
