Junior Kristen Campbell made a season-high 25 saves and the No. 2 University of Wisconsin women’s hockey team blanked Princeton 3-0 in a non-conference game Sunday afternoon at LaBahn Arena.
Freshman Sophie Shirley, senior Annie Pankowski, and junior Presley Norby scored for the Badgers (8-0), who won both games against the Tigers (0-2) over the weekend.
Shirley, who had a three-point performance against Princeton on Friday, scored the winner for the second straight game. She notched her fifth goal of the season, tying linemate Abby Roque for the team lead.
Roque leads the country in points with 14. The reigning WCHA Forward of the Year is tied for the NCAA lead with nine assists.
UW has a 35-game unbeaten streak at home, and Campbell has been a major factor.
“She played well, especially in the second period when there were almost four straight minutes short-handed, and they got a couple good whacks at it, but she had a couple of nice saves and overall good effort,” UW coach Mark Johnson said of Campbell, who earned her first shutout of the season.
