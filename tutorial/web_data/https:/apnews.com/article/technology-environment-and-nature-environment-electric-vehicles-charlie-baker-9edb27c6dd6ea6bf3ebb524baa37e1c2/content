BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts is providing more than $13 million in grants to install more than 300 electric vehicle fast-charging stations at 150 locations around the state.
The grants have been awarded to 54 government and private entities under the Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Incentive Program, the state Department of Environmental Protection said in a statement.
The grants cover 100% of the eligible cost to acquire and install publicly accessible charging stations at government-owned properties and 80% at all other locations, up to $50,000 per charging port.
The charging stations are “a step towards the increased deployment of these clean vehicles, which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality and public health, enhance energy diversity and promote economic growth,” Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement.
The transportation sector accounts for more than 40% of the greenhouse gases emitted in Massachusetts, Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Kathleen Theoharides said.
Of the $13 million, $1.5 million is coming from Massachusetts’ share of the $2.9 billion settlement with Volkswagen Corp. following an emissions cheating scandal, and $11.6 million from the Massachusetts Climate Mitigation Trust.
