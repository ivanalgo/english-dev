“We battled hard tonight, we had a push to get back,″ Kraken coach Dave Hakstol said. ”We just ran out of time, ran out of gas.”
Jimmy Vesey added a goal and Pavel Zacha scored into an empty net with 20 second left to seal the win.

“It was great. I saw the saucer pass coming and it worked out in the end,″ Mercer said. “I took it all in.”
Ruff was happy for his rookie’s accomplishment.

“He had a real good game for us,’' Ruff said of Vesey, who won a job on a training camp tryout. ”He put a lot into camp where there’s a lot of stress battling young players.”

The Kraken cut the deficit to a goal, scoring on a 5-on-3 at 14:48 when McCann converted for his third goal of the season. Mark Giordano and Yanni Gourde assisted.

The contest had a feisty tone throughout.
