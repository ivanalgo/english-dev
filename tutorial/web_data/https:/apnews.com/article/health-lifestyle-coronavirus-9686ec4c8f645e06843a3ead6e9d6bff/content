VIDALIA, Ga. (AP) — The Vidalia Onion Festival is making a comeback this weekend after the coronavirus forced its cancellation in 2020. 
Thousands typically attend the southeast Georgia celebration honoring the state’s famous sweet onion crop. 
“We’re just excited that we’re doing something,” Alexa Britton, one of the festival organizers, told
