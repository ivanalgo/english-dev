WILKES-BARRE — A city man already serving nearly nine years in federal prison for conspiring to distribute bath salts was sentenced Monday to serve an additional five to 10 years after pleading guilty to robbery and weapons charges. Robert Louis Benussi III, 27, pleaded guilty to charges in four cases Monday, with Luzerne County Judge Joseph F. Sklarosky Jr. sentencing him to a total of five to 10 years in prison consecutive to Benussi’s federal sentence. Among the crimes Benussi pleaded guilty to were conspiring to rob a Dollar General store and to robbery for car-jacking a woman in the parking lot of Mesko Glass on North River Street. In September, Benussi was sentenced to 107 months in federal prison followed by three years of probation for conspiring with others to distribute drugs obtained from suppliers in China to buyers in Luzerne County from 2014 to 2015. While he serves his time, Benussi also has a pending civil lawsuit alleging officials at the Luzerne County Correctional Facility failed to properly treat a broken foot, causing him “great pain and discomfort.” — JAMES HALPIN
