LIHUE — In order to accommodate the defense lawyer’s schedule, the sentencing for a man charged with a dozen counts of sexual assault has been continued for a month.
Roy Gonsalves appeared before Judge Kathleen Watanabe on 10 counts of third-degree sexual assault, one count of attempted first-degree sexual assault and one count for first-degree sexual assault Monday to be sentenced.
But his lawyer, Michael Green, could not be at the proceedings. Gonsalves was represented by John Murphy Monday.
“My understanding is that since Mr. Green is not here today, we are going to agree to a continuance,” said Jennifer Winn, first deputy prosecuting attorney.
Gonsalves, 46, was arrested in June 2014 after police say he assaulted a 14-year-old several times between June1, 2005 and June 21, 2007.
Police say Gonsalves touched the minor and had the minor touch him multiple times. He is also alleged to havehad sex with the minor.
He is alleged to have said that he committed the acts, but that the acts were not forced, according to courtdocuments.
Gonsalves was originally headed to trial for the case, but he changed his plea to no contest last October.
Sexual assault in the first degree is a Class A felony and punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
On Thursday, Winn asked a hearing be set this sometime month before the sentencing takes place.
“There is an issue in the case we should perhaps discuss before the next court date,” she said.
That hearing will take place March 15.
Gonsalves is scheduled to be sentenced on April 5.
