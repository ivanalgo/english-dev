University of Wisconsin women’s hockey goalie Kristen Campbell has kept a close eye on her net through the season’s first five games.
The sophomore earned her third shutout of the year, stopping all 20 shots she faced, as the top-ranked Badgers defeated host Syracuse 1-0 on Friday afternoon in New York.
Sophomore winger Abby Roque notched the third game-winning goal of her career, slicing through the defense of the Orange (0-2-1) and firing the puck into the top corner of the net at 6:35 of the second period.
Campbell, a transfer from North Dakota, has not allowed an even-strength goal this season and leads the country in shutouts (3) and wins (5).
“The team was great,” Campbell said after she and the Badgers improved to 5-0-0.
“I felt really confident in there just because the ‘D’ was blocking shots we needed to block and the forwards were getting chips off the wall so I think it was an overall great team effort tonight.”
The teams wrap up their series today at the Tennity Ice Pavilion.
