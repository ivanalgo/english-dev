WAUKESHA, Wis. (AP) â€” A Wisconsin judge has sentenced a former federal agent to jail time after he was convicted of sexually assaulting a woman at his Oconomowoc home in 2013. 
Waukesha County Circuit Judge Maria S. Lazar on Friday sentenced David Scharlat, 55, to five years of probation. As part of that probation, Scharlat will spend 11 months in the county jail, with work release privileges for two of those months. 
The judge rejected sentencing recommendations from both prosecutors and a defense attorney as inappropriate, the 
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel 
 reported.
Scharlat and his attorney insisted on his innocence at the sentencing and vowed to appeal. 
A jury in February found Scharlat 
not guilty of sexually assaulting two women
 but guilty of assaulting a third.
Scharlat worked in diplomatic security protection for the U.S. Department of State. He maintains that the charged incidents were all consensual.
