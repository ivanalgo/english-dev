GIANTS PLAYER TO WATCH: WR Kenny Golladay. The Giants paid $72 million to sign the former Lion to a four-year contract in the offseason. He has yet to score a touchdown. He is due. He has 34 catches for 499 yards in 12 games. Golladay has played six games against Chicago and scored three touchdowns, including a game in 2019 when he had four catches for 158 yards and a TD.
BEARS PLAYER TO WATCH: WR Darnell Mooney. The second-year pro has eclipsed Allen Robinson as Chicago’s most productive receiver. And with 860 yards receiving, he has a chance to reach 1,000 for the first time.
KEY MATCHUP: Bears OLB Robert Quinn vs. Giants LT Andrew Thomas. Quinn ranks second in the NFL with 17 sacks and is closing in on Hall of Famer Richard Dent’s club record of 17 1/2 in 1984. He also needs a half-sack to reach 100 in his career and two to match his personal best of 19 in 2013 with St. Louis.
