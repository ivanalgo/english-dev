SYDNEY (AP) — The South Sydney Rabbitohs have included all four Burgess brothers in an expanded 19-man squad for Friday’s National Rugby League match against the West Tigers.
If they all run on, it will be the first time since 1910 that four brothers have played in the same team in Australia’s top flight competition.
The brothers, from Yorkshire in northern England, have never played together in the same game.
Rabbitohs head coach Michael Maguire selected oldest brother Luke in the front row, Sam at lock and included 21-year-old twins Tom and George on the six-man interchange bench.
“I played with Sam and George last year, I’ve played with Tom and George together, I’ve played with Sam, but we’ve never all been on the field at the same time,” Luke Burgess said. “We’ve obviously mentioned it, but we’re just really enjoying being part of the same club.
“We’re really trying to build a culture where we’re not just four brothers, the whole squad we bond as brothers.”
Souths are vying for top spot in the NRL with two rounds remaining in the regular season.
Maguire said he wanted to see the Burgess family unit in action.
“To have the four Burgess boys all together, it’s a massive day for the club,” he said. “It’s exciting. To be able to be part of a game like this where four brothers come together ... we just want to make sure we give them a great opportunity.”
The 24-year-old Sam played for Bradford Bulls until he moved to South Sydney in 2010, reportedly after Rabbitohs co-owner and actor Russell Crowe interviewed him on the set of a movie.
Luke played for Leeds Rhinos before moving to Souths and George also moved to Sydney before they were all joined by Tom, who played for Bradford in 2012 before signing a one-year contract this season in the NRL.
