PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A man accused of stabbing six family members last week as they slept inside a Philadelphia home has been charged with numerous counts including attempted murder and aggravated assault, authorities announced Monday.
The attacks took place early Friday in three bedrooms on the second floor of the home, authorities have said. Jamal Holmes, 30, who also lived at the house, allegedly went from bedroom to bedroom, stabbing the victims with two different knives. A possible motive has not been disclosed.
The victims, four women and two men, range in age from 26 to 57 and remain hospitalized. Three are in critical condition.
Holmes left the house after the attacks but was soon found covered in blood a few blocks away and was taken into custody without incident. He remained in custody Monday, and it wasn’t known if he has retained an attorney.
