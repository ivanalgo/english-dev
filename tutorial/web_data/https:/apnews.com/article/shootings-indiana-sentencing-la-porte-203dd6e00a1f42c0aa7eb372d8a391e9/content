MICHIGAN CITY — Deiondrai Thompkins, a former Burger King employee who allegedly shot his coworker outside the restaurant, will appear in La Porte Superior Court 1 for argued sentencing on May 10, the one-year-anniversary of the shooting.
Thompkins, now 21, remains incarcerated at La Porte County Jail on a cash-only bond of $100,000.
He is charged with attempted murder, aggravated battery, and two counts of criminal recklessness - felony levels 1, 3, and 5, respectively.
If Judge Michael Bergerson accepts Thompkins’ plea agreement with the state, the attempted murder charge will be dismissed in exchange for Thompkins’ disclosure of the location of the firearm he allegedly used to shoot his 17-year-old coworker.
The remaining three charges, collectively, carry a potential sentence of up to 28 years in the Indiana Department of Correction.
