WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) — The Navajo Nation on Tuesday reported finding no new COVID-19 related deaths for the 10th consecutive day.
The tribe reported nine new confirmed coronavirus cases, but no additional deaths on the vast reservation that covers parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.
The latest numbers bring the Navajo Nation’s pandemic case total to 30,380 with the death toll remaining at 1,262.
Tribal health officials said more than 16,500 people have recovered from COVID-19 thus far.
The tribe had been easing into reopening but that slowed somewhat after coronavirus variants were confirmed on the reservation. Tribal officials urged residents to stay vigilant.
Navajo President Jonathan Nez said the tribe recently had a cluster of COVID-19 cases as a result of a family gathering where people were not wearing masks. 
Tribal public health orders mandate that masks be worn on the reservation and a daily curfew is in effect. Restaurants cannot have dine-in services. 
Navajo Nation roads also are closed to visitors and tourists, which doesn’t affect travel on state highways that run through the reservation. 
Meanwhile, health care facilities across the reservation continue to offer the vaccine by appointment or at drive-thru events.
