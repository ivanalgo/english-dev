Talk about Hurricane Harvey has slowly ebbed months after the hurricane struck, but some families have yet to recover as Christmas approaches.
Donors for Katy Christian Ministries’ annual Santa’s Sleigh: Adopt a Child for Christmas program dropped off gifts for close to 500 children and senior citizens last weekend. It is around 80 more than last year, according to KCM Social Services Director Lily Rodgers.
“Five-hundred children is a lot of children, and some individuals take one child, so that means we have 500 people out there shopping for these kids, which is really neat,” Rodgers said.
Adoptees listed five gift ideas along with their clothing size, favorite color and other information that donors used to find presents, according to KCM’s website.
KCM’s social services branch is restricted to serving people in the Katy ISD area, according to Rodgers, but the children of abuse victims in the greater Houston area were also selected for the Santa’s Sleigh program.
Hurricane Harvey left some families desperate this Christmas, making the program especially important this year, according to Rodgers.
“They’ve lost their Christmas trees, they’re having to spend their savings on repairs, that the last thing they’re thinking of is putting gifts under a tree,” Rodgers said. “So I think this year the need is much larger than it was before, in previous years.”
Families of children in the program can pick up the donations this weekend, and volunteers will deliver the gifts to the senior citizens’ homes, according to Rodgers. Most adopters already delivered their gifts, however Rodgers said donors may still be needed.
“We could always use donors, because if someone, for some reason, for whatever reason, doesn’t drop off their gifts and they’ve adopted a child, then we could possibly have a child that needs adopting,” Rodgers said.
