“Every American that I encountered and told them I’m retiring, their first reaction was, ‘Congratulations.’ Every European I told this, they were, ‘Oh, my God, what are you going to do now?’ I have to say the last few days, I’ve embraced the American way of looking at it a little bit more.” — Germany’s Andrea Petkovic, after losing her final match before ending her career.
