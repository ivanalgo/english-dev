NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Anne Kirkpatrick, a veteran police official who has served as chief of departments in Spokane, Washington, and Oakland, California, won City Council approval as New Orleans’ new police chief Thursday on a 6-1 vote.
Kirkpatrick had been serving as interim chief after Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced the appointment in June, pending council approval. 
Hailed as a reformer by her supporters, Kirkpatrick takes over a department that has been operating under a broad 
reform agreement
 with the U.S. Justice Department that was approved by a federal judge in 2013. It was the result of federal investigations growing out of deadly police shootings of civilians in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
She also must deal with a force that has been steadily 
dropping in manpower
 in recent years, even amid jumps in violent crime during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Kirkpatrick succeeds Shaun Ferguson, who retired last year. Michelle Woodfork took over the chief’s duties on an interim basis and had applied for the job
Voters approved a measure last year granting the council the right to approve or reject a mayor’s nominee for police chief. Kirkpatrick’s approval came despite some complaints from council members that the selection process had not been sufficiently transparent. 
Thursday’s council vote followed a council committee hearing last week in which Kirkpatrick answered questions, outlined plans and pledged to be fair, independent and open to council member’s opinions.

        
    
Council Vice President Helena Moreno, who had expressed support for Woodfork in the past, voted for Kirkpatrick and wished her success.
“We need an independent and determined chief laser-focused on improving public safety. Anne Kirkpatrick has committed to being this type of leader, and I will hold her accountable for that,” Moreno said. “I want this new chief, who was selected by the Mayor, to be successful — we need her to be successful.”
