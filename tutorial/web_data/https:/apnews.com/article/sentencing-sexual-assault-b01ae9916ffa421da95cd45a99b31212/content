BRIDGEPORT -- A local man was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for raping a pregnant woman two years ago.
“This was a violent, vicious sexual assault that I’m sure has left scars on the victim,” Superior Court Judge Robert Devlin began in sentencing 32-year-old Kathram Asad.
“But,” he added, “He did agree to take responsibility and spare the victim from having a trial.”
He sentenced the defendant to 20 years, suspended after he serves 10 years in prison and followed by 10 years’ probation. The judge also ordered Asad to register as a sex offender.
Asad, of unknown address, pleaded guilty to first-degree sexual assault as the case was about to go to trial.
Shortly before midnight on Dec. 22, 2014, police said residents of Maplewood Avenue were awaked by a woman’s screams. When one neighbor looked outside, he saw a naked woman being pummeled in the face by a man, police said. The neighbor yelled and the assailant, his face bleeding, ran off toward Park Avenue.
The victim, who was crying and shaking, was taken to St. Vincent’s Medical Center, where she was treated for multiple injuries, police said.
Police said the woman told them she had been walking to the store at the intersection of Maplewood Avenue and Norman Street when she was approached by a man she didn’t know who asked her if she wanted to go with him to have a few beers. The victim replied she would not because she is pregnant, at which time Asad punched her in the face and shoved her to the ground, police said. He then ripped off her clothes and raped her, police said.

        
    
The victim told police she finally managed to get Asad off her by hitting him in the face with a bottle that was on the ground near her. Before he fled, police said, he also stole $78 from the victim.
Police said they took the victim back to Norman Street, where Asad was being treated in an ambulance for his facial injury, and she identified him as her assailant.
