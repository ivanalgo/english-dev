CHICAGO (AP) — A former Cook County sheriff’s deputy has been sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for his role in a protection racket that also involved his son.
A federal judge announced the sentence for Larry Draus (DROWS’) Sr. at a Tuesday hearing in Chicago. Draus had pleaded guilty earlier to extortion, claiming he was trying to help his son, Larry Draus Jr.
Prosecutors say the elder Draus admitted taking $10,000 and 30 cartons of cigarettes from an informant working for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In return, he promised to protect a warehouse of illegal, untaxed cigarettes.
Earlier this year, Larry Draus Jr. pleaded guilty to paying about $217,000 for 170 cases of contraband cigarettes and accepting protection money. The younger Draus is awaiting sentencing.
