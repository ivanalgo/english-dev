A Rome man convicted in the 2013 murder and robbery of a man received the same sentence of life without parole plus 45 years after Georgia’s high court ordered he be resentenced.
Floyd County Superior Court Judge Bryant Durham resentenced Christopher Rayshun Smith on Tuesday.
Smith was convicted of felony murder, false imprisonment, aggravated battery and two counts each of armed robbery, aggravated assault and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime.
In sending the case back to the local court, the Georgia Supreme Court said some of the underlying crimes should have been merged with other crimes for sentencing purposes. For example, in this case the crime of aggravated assault merges with felony murder for sentencing purposes.
Smith, Jamarrcus Rhashad Sullivan and Antonio Devion Jones were convicted for their parts in the June 1, 2013, robbery and fatal shooting of Kevin Daniel at his home on Wheeler Street.
Daniel, 39, fought the robbers and was shot inside his home. He then stumbled outside, where he was again shot while on the ground.
Sullivan was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole plus 45 years, followed by 20 years’ probation on murder charges.
Sullivan appealed his conviction, and the Georgia Supreme Court heard oral arguments on March 6 concerning his claims that his trial attorney was ineffective. The high court has not ruled on that issue.
Jones, who testified against Sullivan and Smith, was sentenced to 15 years on voluntary manslaughter and robbery charges.
