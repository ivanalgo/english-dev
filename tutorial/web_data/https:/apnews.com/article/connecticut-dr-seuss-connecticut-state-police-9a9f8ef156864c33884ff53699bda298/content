Oh, the places you’ll go as a Connecticut State Police trooper.
Help a motorist at night, catch a fugitive in flight. Enforce travel in the lane of carpool.
Or, as on Thursday, read Dr. Seuss books a school.
Troopers read works from the children’s author as part of Read Across America Day, a literacy initiative of the National Education Association.
The readings took place in grade schools in Bristol, and Stafford and other towns, according to spokeswoman Kelly Grant.
The officers posted photos of themselves reading in uniform to school children, and posing alongside people dressed up as characters from Dr. Seuss titles like “One Fish, Two Fish” and “Cat in the Hat.”
It’s the twentieth anniversary of the NEA program, which honors the birthday of the author, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel. He was born 113 years ago, and died in 1991.
