Jason Wright is expected to retain his job as president of the Washington Commanders, at least initially, after 
Josh Harris’ group takes over
, a person with knowledge of the situation said.
The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Friday because the team has not announcing its staffing plans.
Wright has served in the role since the summer of 2020, when he 
became the first Black president
 of an NFL team.
It’s expected that he’ll be an important part of the transition between Dan Snyder and new ownership that also 
includes Magic Johnson
. That would be in line with Harris’ previous experiences assuming control of the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and NHL’s New Jersey Devils: not making major changes immediately before taking time to assess the state of the organization.
The Washington Post was first to report Wright’s status.
Harris’ group could be in charge before next season starts. NFL owners are 
set to consider and potentially vote to approve
 the record $6.05 billion sale at a meeting July 20 in Minneapolis.
That would give new owners plenty of time to evaluate Wright, coach and head of football operations Ron Rivera and others on the football and business sides. Rivera is going into his fourth season with Washington.
