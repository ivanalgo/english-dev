Venus Williams, who recently played in the finals of Wimbledon, was in Philadelphia on Monday to play in Mylan World Team Tennis League action at Hagan Arena on the campus of Saint Joseph’s University.
Williams, who plays for the Washington Kastles, was excited to play against the Freedoms. Proud about making it to the Wimbledon finals, she was more excited about her father, Richard Williams, who will be inducted into the American Tennis Association Hall of Fame.
“It goes without saying what my dad has done for Serena and I, and changing the game of tennis ,and for what he’s done for the sport, too. I’m forever grateful. I’m so excited for his honor,” she said.
This is a big year for the American Tennis Association. The organization is celebrating 100 years of dedication to the African-American tennis community as the oldest African-American sports organization in the nation. Williams will be honored for his brilliant work as a father and coach of great tennis sisters — Venus and Serena Williams.
Richard Williams will be honored during the ATA’s Centennial Celebration at the Honors Gala on Aug. 2. He will be one of the first inductees into the new Hall of Fame. The event will take place at the Lord Baltimore Hotel in Baltimore, Md. The ceremony will begin at 7 p.m.
