ANSWERS
1st Round. d. The oldest Grand Slam tennis tournament, first held in 1877, had never been canceled for any reason other than a world war until last year’s pandemic.
2nd Round. b. Hewitt beat David Nalbandian in the 2002 Wimbledon men’s final for his second Grand Slam title. Since then, the 17 men’s singles trophies have been divided this way: eight to Federer, five to Djokovic, two to Nadal and two to Murray.
3rd Round. c. One Williams sister or the other has been the Wimbledon women’s singles champion or runner-up a total of 20 times over the past 20 years. Serena Williams has won the tournament seven times and been the runner-up another four; Venus Williams has won it five times and been the runner-up another four. They have met each other in four all-Williams finals. 
4th Round. b. Lendl reached 19 Grand Slam finals, winning eight championships and finishing as the runner-up a record-tying 11 times (Federer also has lost 11 major finals). Sampras is next on the list with 18.
Quarterfinals. a. Schroeder did it at Wimbledon in 1949, trailing two sets to none in the first round and quarterfinals en route to the championship. That was the only time the American entered Wimbledon. The other three men listed as possible answers all did it earlier: Wrenn at the U.S. Championships in 1896, Cochet at Wimbledon in 1927, Petra at Wimbledon in 1946.
Semifinals. c. Stevenson is the only woman to make it all the way to the semifinals at the All England Club after going through qualifying to get into the main draw. She did it at age 18 in 1999. Stevenson was beaten by Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals. Kanepi (2010) and Beltrame-Bremond (2006) reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon as qualifiers; Podoroska got to the semifinals as a qualifier at last year’s French Open.
Final. b. Williams is 26-2 in that span on grass, with all of the matches at Wimbledon — and both of the losses in the final. She won the titles in 2015 and 2016, sat out 2017 because she was pregnant, then was the runner-up to Angelique Kerber in 2018 and to Simona Halep in 2019.
