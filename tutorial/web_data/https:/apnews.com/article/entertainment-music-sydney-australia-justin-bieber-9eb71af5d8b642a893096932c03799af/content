Justin Bieber reportedly hand-picked a dozen models to party with during a late-night cruise in Australia.
The 23-year-old singer is currently on tour in the country - but has spent some of his spare time with a group of beautiful women, all of whom were asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement and surrender their phones before boarding his boat.
Roze Cook and Nyssa Large, who Justin follows on Instagram, were among the 12 glamorous girls hand-picked for the three-hour boat trip, according to the Daily Telegraph newspaper in Australia.
Both women partied with Justin during his trip Down Under two years ago - but the ‘Sorry’ hitmaker returned to his hotel alone after his boat docked after midnight early on Sunday morning (03.12.17).
Justin’s late-night party came shortly after he reportedly told a fan she made him “sick” after she asked for a selfie.
The chart-topping star was approached by 20-year-old Sabah Helal in Sydney during the week - but Justin left her in tears after verbally lashing out following her request.
Justin allegedly said to her: “You’re invading my privacy, I don’t want a photo. Look at you, you make me sick.”
Sabah’s mother Houda Bennaoui admitted the situation left her daughter feeling humiliated.
She said: “My daughter was bawling her eyes out. She was dying to meet him and then he humiliated her.
“After years of supporting him, my daughter will never see him again in concert.”

        
    
Justin’s fan snub also came after Adele defended him when he was booed during her recent concert in Sydney.
Adele asked concertgoers at the ANZ Stadium if they planned to attend Justin’s upcoming show at the same venue, which prompted boos from her fans.
However, she quickly rushed to defend the Canadian star, saying: “If you started out at 12, you’d be like that too, okay!”
