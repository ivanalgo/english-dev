MORRISON – A 33-year-old Dixon man charged with sexually abusing a girl younger than 13 was sentenced Tuesday to 4 years’ probation.
Nathan J. Rice also must pay a maximum of $5,000 restitution for the girl’s treatment.
Rice was charged Sept. 7 with aggravated criminal sexual abuse, which could have netted him 3 to
7 years in prison. The probation was the result of a plea agreement, court records show.
A psychological evaluation also was submitted and sealed at sentencing.
He has been in Whiteside County Jail on $100,000 bond since his arrest.
The incident happened about 4 years ago, while Rice was living in Morrison, but the girl did not report it until June, Morrison Police Chief Brian Melton said at the time.
