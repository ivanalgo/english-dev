GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — The No. 2 leader of North Carolina House Democrats announced Tuesday she is stepping down from the General Assembly next month because she’s taking a new job within the University of North Carolina system.
Three-term Rep. Ashton Wheeler Clemmons of Guilford County, a former elementary school teacher and school system administrator, joined the House in 2019 and became a leading voice for the chamber’s minority party on education issues. She later became deputy leader of the House Democratic Caucus. She was also involved in legislation to 
raise the minimum age for marriage
 and improve conditions for prisoners who are pregnant or give birth.
Clemmons “came to the General Assembly for the right reason – she wanted to help the people of our state,” House Minority Leader Robert Reives said in a statement. “She has authentically stayed true to that calling and leaves our caucus and state stronger.”
She will become an UNC system associate vice president for strategy and policy on education from preschool through high school. 
Clemmons is currently the Democratic nominee in the 57th House District against Republican Janice Davis. Guilford County Democratic activists need to choose a replacement nominee and someone to fill out the remainder of Clemmons’ term through year’s end. 
Clemmons didn’t reveal a specific August resignation date. She said Tuesday she would wait until her successor is selected to do so. 
House Appropriations Committer senior co-chairman Jason Saine, a Lincoln County Republican, announced Monday that he would 
resign from his legislative seat
 on Aug. 12.
