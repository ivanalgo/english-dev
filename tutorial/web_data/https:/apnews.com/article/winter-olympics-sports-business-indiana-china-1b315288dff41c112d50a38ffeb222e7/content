INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana gamblers will be able to put some wagers down on events during the upcoming Winter Olympics.
The state Gaming Commission this past week authorized Indiana casinos and mobile sports wagering operators to offer betting lines on seven Winter Olympic events. Those are alpine skiing, bobsled, cross-country skiing, curling, ice hockey, short-track speed skating and speed skating, 
The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported.
Sports wagering operators aren’t required to accept bets on all the events, but many offer a wide variety of betting options since Indiana legalized sports wagering in 2019.
Wagering for some Olympic events will take planning since they will take place in China several hours before they are broadcast on delay in the U.S. The Beijing games are scheduled to run Feb 4-20.
