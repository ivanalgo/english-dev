A former West Orange-Stark coach charged with two counts of failing to render aid in a 2015 car crash that killed a 25-year-old mother and her 6-year-old child was booked into Orange County Prison earlier this week to serve a jail sentence of 180 days.
Carl Broussard, 54, turned himself in Tuesday at 11 p.m. He was sentenced to 180 days in prison by 260th District Court Judge Buddie Hahn four days after avoiding jail time during a May sentencing hearing where he was given 10 years of probation.
He struck and killed Ava Lewis, 25, and her daughter LaMya Newhouse, 6, with his car as they crossed MacArthur Drive in Orange on Nov. 2, 2015. In March, Broussard pleaded guilty to two second-degree felony counts of failing to stop and render aid.
