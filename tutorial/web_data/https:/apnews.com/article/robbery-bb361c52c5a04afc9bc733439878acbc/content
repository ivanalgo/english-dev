ANSONIA—A young West Haven man has admitted to committing a string of convenience store robberies, police said Wednesday.
Everald Davis, 29, was arrested Mar. 31, 2016, after he turned himself in and confessed to robbing the Xpress Mart at 180 Wakelee Drive a week before, according to police.
After “subsiquent interviews,” police said that Davis “admitted to robbing the Shell Station in Ansonia and two more robberies in West Haven.”
The interrogations stemmed from the suspicion that Davis robbed more stores than he let on. In particular, authroities suspected him of hitting the Shell Station at 22 Great Hill Road on Mar. 29, 2016. Police said the robbery was “similar,” involving “dark skinned male armed with a dark colored handgun.”
Davis was charged Feb. 27 with first-degree robbery and second-degree larceny and held on a $75,000 bond.
