WHEATON, Ill. (AP) — A former suburban Chicago man has been sentenced to 50 years in prison for the 2011 sexual assault and slaying of his ex-wife.
Juan Granados, 43, was sentenced Tuesday after being found guilty last year of first-degree murder and criminal sexual assault for attacking and killing Nancy Bustos.
A DuPage County judge sentenced Granados to 40 years in prison on the murder charge and 10 years for the sexual assault, with the sentences to be served consecutively.
Bustos, 36, was found dead in October 2011 in the bathroom of the Glen Ellyn apartment where she and Granados, who had divorced the previous year, were living, the 
Chicago Tribune
 reported.
Bustos had been sexually assaulted and strangled to death. Investigators determined that the evening before she and Granados had been involved in a scuffle.
They had been married for 10 years and had two children, and although they divorced in 2010. They had continued living together in the apartment but at the time of her death, Bustos was trying to move out after she started dating someone new.
After Bustos’ death, police said Granados drove to Mexico and lived there for six years, eventually remarrying.
He was extradited to the U.S. in late 2017.
