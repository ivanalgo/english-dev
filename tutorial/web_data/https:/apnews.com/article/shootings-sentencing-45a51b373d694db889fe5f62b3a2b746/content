A sentencing for a man who admitted his role in the shooting death of another man in 2016 was postponed Friday.
Kahmarri Spencer,19, who was charged with murder, pleaded guilty in August to aiding aggravated battery as part of a plea agreement. He and two others are charged in the killing of Robert Moore, 55, who was standing on his sister’s porch on Avondale Drive when he was shot Sept. 20, 2016.
Spencer told police he thought Moore was a rival gang member.
Allen Superior Court Judge Fran Gull approved a request from defense attorney Robert Gevers to push back sentencing to April 20. That will follow the trial of Derek Ford, who is charged with murder in the case.
Spencer is set to testify against Ford, who prosecutors have identified as the trigger man.
Ford, Spencer and Trevon Sullivan were in a car in the Avondale Drive area and thought they saw rival gang members on the porch of a home, according to court documents. Moore, some of his family members and homeowner Gloria Winston were there instead.
Court documents say Spencer and another person got out of the car, which was parked in a nearby alley, and several shots were fired at people on the porch. Spencer said in court last year his gun jammed.
Sullivan was also charged with murder but pleaded guilty in August to assisting a criminal. He is scheduled to be sentenced next week.
