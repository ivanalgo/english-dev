MEXICO CITY (AP) — The latest on Hurricane Willa and other storms (all times local):
4:10 p.m.
Hurricane Willa has weakened slightly off Mexico’s Pacific Coast and is now a Category 4 storm, but remains “extremely dangerous” ahead of an expected landfall Tuesday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center says Willa’s maximum sustained winds are now 155 mph (250 kph). That’s just 1 mph below the threshold for a Category 5 hurricane.
Regardless of category, the storm is expected to bring life-threatening storm surge and rains over parts of west-central and southwestern Mexico.
A hurricane warning is in place for a stretch of coastline from San Blas to the popular resort city of Mazatlan, as well as the offshore Islas Marias, a set of islands that include a nature preserve and a federal prison.
9:50 a.m.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center says Hurricane Willa has grown into a potentially catastrophic Category 5 storm on a track toward the Mexican coast south of Mazatlan.
Willa has maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph), though it’s projected to weaken somewhat before hitting land late Tuesday. It is still likely to be an extremely dangerous hurricane when it hits.
It’s located about 135 miles (215 kilometers) south-southwest of Cabo Corrientes and is heading north at 7 mph (11 kph).
