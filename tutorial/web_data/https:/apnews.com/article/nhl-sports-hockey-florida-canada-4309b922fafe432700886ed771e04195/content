WASHINGTON (AP) — Marc-Andre Fleury stopped Alex Ovechkin in the shootout after Seth Jones tied it midway through the third period and the Chciago Blackhawks rallied past the Washington Captials 4-3 Thursday night. 
Patrick Kane scored the shootout winner, and Fleury got some assistance from his goalposts to help Chicago win for the third time in five games. The Blackhawks have won seven of 10 games since Derek King took over as interim coach when Jeremy Colliton was fired.
The Capitals lost by blowing a lead for the second time in two games. They coughed up a 4-1 lead and fell in regulation at Florida on Tuesday.
Washington will take the point from reaching overtime but fell to 0-7 in games this season that went past regulation. This was the Capitals’ first shootout of the season.
It probably should not have gotten that far. Garnet Hathaway put the Capitals ahead 57 seconds into the third period, but Jones fired a laser through traffic that tied the score at 3.
