House Minority Whip Steve Scalise incorrectly slammed Democrats Friday for a subpoena asking Donald Trump Jr. to testify in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee a subpoena actually issued by Republican committee Chairman Richard Burr.
“You can’t make this stuff up: Democrats are subpoenaing [Donald Trump Jr.] based on the testimony of Michael Cohen a man who lied to Congress multiple times. This is how low they are willing to sink to harass[Donald Trump] his entire family. The [Mueller Report] is done. Move on,” the Louisiana Republican tweeted, which was eventuallydeletedand called a “staff error,” according to a Politico reporter.
While the Democratic members of the committee supported the subpoena, they have no power to subpoena as a part of the minority party.
Senate Majority Leader Mitchell McConnell declared “case closed” on the Mueller investigation and called for Congress to “move on.”
Mr. Burr subpoenaed President Trump’s eldest son to testify about his testimony regarding the investigation.
His fellow North Carolina Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis, also incorrectly blamed Democrats for the subpoena Thursday.
“I agree with Leader McConnell: this case is closed. The Mueller Report cleared[Donald Trump Jr.]and he’s already spent 27 hours testifying before Congress. Dems have made it clear this is all about politics. It’s time to move on start focusing on issues that matter to Americans,” Mr. Tillis tweeted.
