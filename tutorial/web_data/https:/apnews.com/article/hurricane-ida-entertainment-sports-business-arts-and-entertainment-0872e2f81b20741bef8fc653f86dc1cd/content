LOS ANGELES (AP) — The U.S. evacuation from Afghanistan and fearsome Hurricane Ida drew viewers to cable channels that focused on the unfolding events.
Fox News Channel had the lion’s share of the most-watched cable shows last week, 19 of the top 20, according to Nielsen figures out Tuesday. MSNBC got a less dramatic ratings bump from the prior week.
Last week’s coverage of the removal of U.S. citizens and Afghans at risk included a 
devastating airport suicide bombing
 that killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 160 Afghans. The 
evacuation ended Monday
.
The Weather Channel’s audience grew as Ida barreled toward the Gulf Coast. The channel’s ratings among young adult viewers increased by 38% last week over the same period in 2020.
As Ida made landfall in Louisiana last Sunday, Weather Channel was the most-watched on cable among viewers 25 to 54.
The destructive hurricane 
cost lives and left more than 1 million homes and businesses in Louisiana and Mississippi without power
.
Fox News improved its performance from the previous week when it topped all broadcast and cable outlets. But NBC, on the strength of its top-rated “America’s Got Talent” and football broadcasts, was the most-watched network.
