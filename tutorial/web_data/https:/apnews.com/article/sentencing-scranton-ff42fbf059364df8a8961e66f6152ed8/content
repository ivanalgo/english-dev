Former Scranton Mayor Bill Courtright’s sentencing on federal corruption charges is postponed so the U.S. probation office can have more time to complete a needed report.
U.S. District Judge Malachy E. Mannion signed an order Sept. 10 that pushes back Courtright’s Nov. 14 sentencing but does not set a new date or deadline for the probation office’s presentence report. The order states that the office needs more time to “gather and assimilate information for inclusion” in the report.
Once the probation office’s report is complete, Mannion will set a new sentencing date. It is not unusual for presentence reports to be delayed.
“I don’t know the circumstances surrounding why they needed more time,” U.S. attorney’s office spokeswoman Dawn Clark said.
Courtright resigned and pleaded guilty in July to taking bribes, extortion and conspiracy.
Federal authorities accused Courtright of directing city workers to hold up licenses, permits or contracts to extort cash and campaign contributions from developers and others who had business with the city.
FBI agents raided City Hall and Courtright’s West Mountain home Jan. 9. They found about $29,450 in a safe in his home.
The maximum penalty Courtright could face is 35 years in prison and $750,000 in fines.
Courtright’s attorney, Paul Walker, also did not know why the probation office needed more time. Asked if the delay frustrates the former mayor, Walker said, “I don’t think he has a position one way or the other.”
