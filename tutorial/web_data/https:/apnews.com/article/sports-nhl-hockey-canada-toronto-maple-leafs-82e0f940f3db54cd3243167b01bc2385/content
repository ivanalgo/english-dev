OTTAWA (AP) â€” The Ottawa Senators have signed head coach D.J. Smith to a two-year extension.
The club announced the deal Wednesday. It will keep the 44-year-old Smith behind the bench through the 2023-24 season. The team also holds an option for the following year.
Smith, a former assistant with the Toronto Maple Leafs, was hired by the Senators in May 2019. He has a 48-62-17 record over his first two seasons at the helm. Ottawa finished ahead of only Vancouver in the seven-team, all-Canadian North Division last season.
