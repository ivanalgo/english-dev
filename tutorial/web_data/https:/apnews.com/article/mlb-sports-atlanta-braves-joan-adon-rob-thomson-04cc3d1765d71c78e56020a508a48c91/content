CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago Cubs stopped the Atlanta Braves’ 14-game winning streak and ended their own 10-game skid with a 1-0 victory Friday behind rookie Christoper Morel’s eight-inning sacrifice fly.
A pair of double-digit streaks had not ended in the same game since Philadelphia beat Houston on Sept. 15, 1999, ending the Phillies’ skid at 11 and the Brewers’ winning streak at 12.
Chris Martin (1-0) pitched a perfect eighth for his first win for the Cubs. A.J Minter (2-1) was the loser.

Ray lost his bid when Max Stassi hit a high chopper toward the mound that went right over the pitcher’s head. The reigning AL Cy Young Award winner didn’t jump, and the ball skipped off the top of his glove, giving Stassi time to beat out an infield single.
Ray finished the seventh and came back out for the eighth, when Juan Lagares led off with a triple and scored on Andrew Velazquez’s double. Ray (6-6) was pulled after that, charged with a run three hits and a walk with 10 strikeouts. 
Julio Rodriguez had three hits, Ty France drove in three and Cal Raleigh hit his eighth homer of the season for Seattle.

Gose (3-0) earned the victory. Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw, making his second start since returning from a back injury, allowed one run and five hits in five innings. The left-hander threw 56 of 81 pitches for strikes, and gave up one walk with four strikeouts.
