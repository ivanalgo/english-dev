NEW YORK (AP) — New York Islanders forward Casey Cizikas has been suspended for one game without pay for 
 boarding Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Brendan Smith
, the NHL announced Saturday. 
The incident occurred in the third period of a game Friday night at Carolina. Smith tried to control a loose puck in a corner and was hit from behind by Cizikas, who had closed in to forecheck. The force of the hit sent Smith’s helmet hard into the plexiglass and Cizikas was assessed a minor penalty on the play. 
Under terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Cizikas will forfeit $12,500 that will go to the Players’ Emergency Assistance Fund.
