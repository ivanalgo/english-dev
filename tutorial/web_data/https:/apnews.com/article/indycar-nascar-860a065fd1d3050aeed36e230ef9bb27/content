INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Chip Ganassi Racing will return to IMSA sports car competition next season with Cadillac in the Daytona Prototype international class. 
Ganassi made its sports car racing debut in 2004 in the DPi class before it became a Ford factory GT Le Mans program from 2016 through 2019. Ganassi’s sports car program was shelved in 2020 when Ford pulled out of IMSA. 
The sports car program won seven championships in IMSA, as well as eight Rolex 24 at Daytona victories and wins in both the 12 Hours of Sebring and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Ganassi is the only team owner to win three-straight Rolex 24’s from 2006 to 2008. 
The Ganassi team will replace Wayne Taylor Racing in the Cadillac lineup. Wayne Taylor Racing is moving to Acura next season as a factory team. 
Ganassi for years fielded a “Star Car” each season at the Rolex 24 that featured a lineup composed of drivers from his NASCAR and IndyCar teams. Next year, that could include seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson, who is moving to IndyCar next season to drive for Ganassi. 
Rick Hendrick said after the NASCAR season finale that both Cup champion Chase Elliott and Johnson are planning to compete in the Daytona 24. Elliott declined to name the team he will drive for, and he had few details on Johnson’s plans.
