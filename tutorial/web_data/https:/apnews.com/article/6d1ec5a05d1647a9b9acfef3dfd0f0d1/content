SYDNEY (AP) — The Western Sydney Wanderers have reached the A-League grand final in their debut season thanks to a 2-0 win over the Brisbane Roar.
Dino Kresinger gave the Wanderers, who finished in first place during the regular season, a 1-0 lead before a sellout crowd of nearly 20,000 at Parramatta Stadium, and former Japan international Shinji Ono finished off Brisbane in the 72nd minute.
The Wanderers will play the winner of Sunday’s other semifinal between Central Coast and the Melbourne Victory in the April 21 final in Sydney.
Attacking midfielder Ono, who played 56 times for Japan in a 10-year international career and made 112 appearances for Feyenoord, said “everyone believed we could make the final with the team we have.”
