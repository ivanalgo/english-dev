Donald Trump’s plan is now clear. His real goal, after losing the election, is Trump TV, a far right alternative to Fox News.
Why does this make sense?
Trump will have absolute power over content with no restrictions or fact checks and full freedom to launch attacks or conspiracy theories against all perceived enemies. It’s his dream for settling all scores, and a revenue stream from angry followers who will never quit.
Trump already has the infrastructure in place by having Steve Bannon of the alt right Breitbart news as his campaign CEO, David Bossie, a 30-year Clinton antagonist, as deputy campaign manager, and Roger Ailes, formerly of Fox News, as his mentor.
From the beginning, it seems he set himself up to lose the election. Why else would he systematically alienate whole demographic swaths of the electorate, such as Latinos, African-Americans, Muslims, women and even parts of the Republican Party? He never represented any party except himself.
Everyone who does business with him loses, even if it’s “only” their self respect. U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Oshkosh, should be listening. For an expert con man, we are all marks.
