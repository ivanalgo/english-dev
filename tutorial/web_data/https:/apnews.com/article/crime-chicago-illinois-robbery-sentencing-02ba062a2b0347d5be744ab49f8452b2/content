CHICAGO (AP) — A 32-year prison sentence has been handed a convicted Illinois bank robber for a 2009 crime spree that began after he escaped custody while on his way to a sentencing hearing.
Robert Maday was en route to a hearing in Rolling Meadows when he grabbed a handgun from one of two Cook County state’s attorney’s officers who were transporting him and locked them inside their vehicle.
Maday took part in two carjackings and one bank robbery before he was recaptured.
The sentence handed down Wednesday by U.S. District Court Judge Ruben Castillo won’t begin until Maday completes a 30-year prison term for different series of bank robberies.
Maday received a 13-year sentenced after pleading guilty to several aggravated robberies that led him to be in custody in the first place.
