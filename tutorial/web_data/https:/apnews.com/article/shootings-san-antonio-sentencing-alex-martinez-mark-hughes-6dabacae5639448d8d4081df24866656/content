A San Antonio man has been sentenced in a 2017 killing at a Northeast Side mobile home park.
Alex Martinez Ortiz was 20 when he was arrested in April 2017 and charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Mark Hughes, 29. When authorities arrived around 12:30 a.m. March 29, 2017, at a mobile home park in the 6700 block of Walzem Road, they found Hughes, who had been shot multiple times. He was taken to San Antonio Military Medical Center where he later died.
Court records indicate that Hughes was doing carpentry work on fencing around a trailer at the park when he had to cross over onto another trailer’s property and got into an altercation with residents. The situation later escalated with Ortiz shooting Hughes, which was corroborated by a witness.
At a pre-sentencing investigation hearing Tuesday, Ortiz took responsibility for the shooting and entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors before Judge Ron Rangel in the 379th state District Court for a sentence of 25 years in prison, the maximum under the deal.
Because there was an affirmative finding of assault with a deadly weapon, Ortiz, now 22, will have to serve at least half of his 25-year term before he is eligible for parole.
