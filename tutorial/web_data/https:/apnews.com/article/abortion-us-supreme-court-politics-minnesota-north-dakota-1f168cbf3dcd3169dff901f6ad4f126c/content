MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has signed an executive order meant to protect the state’s abortion services from laws in neighboring states, following the U.S. Supreme Court decision ending constitutional protections for the procedure.
Walz said his action should help shield people seeking or providing abortions in Minnesota from facing legal consequences in other states. The Supreme Court’s opinion to reverse Roe v. Wade immediately halted most abortions in South Dakota and Wisconsin and enacted a trigger law to end abortions in North Dakota after 30 days.
Abortion remains legal in Minnesota. Walz has vowed to reject requests to extradite individuals who are accused of committing acts related to reproductive health care that are not criminal offenses in Minnesota.
“My office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom,” Walz said.
The Red River Women’s Clinic in Fargo, which is North Dakota’s sole abortion provider, plans to move across the river to Minnesota, clinic owner Tammi Kromenaker said Saturday. She said she has secured a location in Moorhead but gave no further details.
