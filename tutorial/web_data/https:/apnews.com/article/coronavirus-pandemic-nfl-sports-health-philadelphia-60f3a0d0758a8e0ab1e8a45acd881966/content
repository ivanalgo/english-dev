PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Garrett Gilbert is set to start at quarterback for Washington at Philadelphia in a key game Tuesday night that has NFC wild-card implications.
Taylor Heinicke and Kyle Allen were not able to get out of NFL COVID-19 protocol in time to play against the Eagles. Gilbert signed with Washington on Friday after Heinicke went into virus protocol. Kyle Shurmur was promoted from the practice squad to back up Gilbert, whose only pro start came with the Dallas Cowboys last season.
Washington was also missing 2020 All-Pro guard Brandon Scherff, top cornerback Kendall Fuller and starting safety Kamren Curl because of the coronavirus protocol. Defensive tackle Tim Settle and tight end Sammis Reyes were inactive despite testing negative.
Washington was also without injured wide receiver Curtis Samuel and running back J.D. McKissic. The team put McKissic on injured reserve prior to the game.
Tight end Ricky Seals-Jones, who was listed as questionable with a non-COVID-19 illness, was active for Washington. Pass rusher James Smith-Williams and receiver Antonio Gandy-Golden were also inactive for Washington.
The game was pushed back from a Sunday afternoon start until Tuesday night because of Washington’s virus outbreak that could have led to more than a half-dozen defensive starters being unavailable. The delay allowed the team to get defensive tackle Matt Ioannidis and reserve cornerback Troy Apke back to face the Eagles.

        
    
Philadelphia came into the game much healthier, with QB Jalen Hurts a full participant in practice the previous two days. Hurts had previously been bothered by an ankle injury.
Defensive back Kary Vincent Jr., defensive tackle Marlon Tuipuloto, cornerback Tay Gowan and QB Reid Sinnett were inactive for the Eagles.
