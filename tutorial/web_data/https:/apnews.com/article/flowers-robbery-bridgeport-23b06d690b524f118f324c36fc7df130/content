BRIDGEPORT â€” You know that famous photo of the hippie who stuck the stem of a carnation in the barrel of a gun as part of a peace protest at the Pentagon in 1967?
The scene in Bridgeport was practically reversed Wednesday, when a young man stuck a barrel gun in the face of a florist, according to police.
The proprietor of El Centenario flower shop on Fairfield Avenue was shaken, but unhurt.
The alleged armed robber might have thought he was fresh as daisies as he fled with cash. But two days later, officials say, they nabbed him.
The suspect, taken into custody Thursday, has not been named because he is a minor, according to city spokesman Av Harris.
If the suspect is guilty, perhaps the lesson can nip his criminal career in the bud.
