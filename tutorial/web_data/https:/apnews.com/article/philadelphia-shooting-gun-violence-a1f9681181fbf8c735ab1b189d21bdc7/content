PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Authorities have announced the arrest of one person in a shooting that wounded seven people in Philadelphia earlier in the week.
Authorities said three men got out of a car in north Philadelphia shortly before 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, walked to the corner, fired shots and then went back to the car and fled. Police said one man was critically wounded and six other people ranging in age from 16 to 46 were listed as stable.
Police said Friday night that officers located the car and placed it under surveillance, and shortly after that officers arrested 23-year-old Tyheed Harvey as he got into the vehicle. Harvey was charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy and related offenses.
The city’s police commissioner, Kevin Bethel, said what he called a “senseless blatant disregard for life” had “no place in our city.” 
A message was sent Saturday to the Defender Association of Philadelphia asking whether that organization would be representing Harvey and offering an opportunity to comment on the charges against him.
