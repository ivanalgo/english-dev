DALLAS (AP) — A gag order has been issued in the case of a former Dallas police officer charged in the fatal shooting of her unarmed black neighbor whose apartment she says she mistook as her own.
State District Judge Tammy Kemp ordered attorneys in the case to not speak publicly after meeting in her chambers Tuesday with a prosecutor and attorneys for Amber Guyger.
Guyger, who is white, is 
charged
 with murder in the 
Sept. 6 shooting
 of Botham Jean, a 26-year-old native of the Caribbean island of St. Lucia who worked in Dallas for an accounting and consulting firm.
Guyger told investigators that when she entered Jean’s apartment — which was directly above hers — she thought it was hers.
She was 
fired
 following the shooting.
