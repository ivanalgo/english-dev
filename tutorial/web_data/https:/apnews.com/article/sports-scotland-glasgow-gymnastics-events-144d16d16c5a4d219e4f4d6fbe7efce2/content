GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) — A 17-year-old Canadian who also holds Russian citizenship has won five of the six gold medals in rhythmic gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games.
Vancouver-born Patricia Bezzoubenko, based in Thornhill, Ontario, near Toronto, but who trains regularly with the Russian gymnastics team in Moscow, won the individual all-around title and the team title with Canada.
She then won three of the four individual apparatus events on Saturday — the clubs, hoop and ball — on the final day of the event at the Hydro building near the River Clyde in central Glasgow.
Attempting to make it six golds in six events, Bezzoubenko finished third in the ribbon.
Francesca Jones of Wales won gold in the ribbon and Wong Poh San of Malaysia the silver. Jones also finished with five silver medals.
