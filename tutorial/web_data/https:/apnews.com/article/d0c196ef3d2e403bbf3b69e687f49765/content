UVALDE, Texas (AP) — A driver convicted in a church bus crash in South Texas that left 
13 people dead
 will soon learn his punishment.
Twenty-one-year-old 
Jack Dillon Young
 , of Leakey, faces up to 270 years in prison after 
pleading no contest
 in June to 13 counts of intoxication manslaughter and one count of intoxication assault.
Prosecutors say Young was 
driving under the influence
 of a prescription antidepressant and had smoked marijuana before the 
March 2017 collision
 on U.S Highway 83 near Uvalde, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) west of San Antonio.
His sentencing hearing began Wednesday in Uvalde.
Defense attorney Rogelio Munoz asked for mercy and said doctors didn’t properly monitor Young’s prescription drug use.
The hearing is expected to last at least through the end of the week.
