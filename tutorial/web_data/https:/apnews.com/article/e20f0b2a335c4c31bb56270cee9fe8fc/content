CHICAGO (AP) — A judge says a Chicago warehouse that R. Kelly is renting can be used only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and only as a recording studio.
 
The Chicago Sun-Times
 says the Cook County judge also prohibited use of the second floor Tuesday, after building inspectors found faulty stairs.
The ruling comes a week after Chicago building inspectors found code violations at the R&B star’s recording studio on the city’s near West Side during a court-ordered inspection. Those violations included evidence the industrial space was used as a residence.
Kelly has come under fire after women featured on a Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly” made new sexual misconduct allegations against the singer. Kelly has 
denied
 the allegations.
