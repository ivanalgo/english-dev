NEW YORK (AP) — New York Mets starter Tylor Megill and four relievers combined on the first no-hitter of the Major League Baseball season, teaming up to throw a whopping 159 pitches and beat the Philadelphia Phillies 3-0 Friday night.
Megill was pulled after five innings and 88 pitches. The bullpen took over from there, with Drew Smith, Joely Rodríguez, Seth Lugo and Edwin Díaz completing the second no-hitter in Mets history.
Díaz finished it off in style, striking out Bryce Harper, Nick Castellanos and J.T. Realmuto in the ninth. Mets pitchers combined to fan 12 and walk six.
Johan Santana threw the Mets’ only previous no-hitter on June 1, 2012, when he struck out eight and needed 134 pitches in an 8-0 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Megill (4-0) struck out five and walked three in his 23rd major league start. Smith got four outs, Rodriguez got three and Lugo recorded the last two outs in the eighth before Díaz took over.
Jeff McNeil hit a two-run single in the fifth off Aaron Nola (1-3). Pete Alonso homered with two outs in the sixth.
MIAMI (AP) — Jorge Soler and Miguel Rojas homered and Miami won its sixth straight game with a victory over Seattle.

Marlins starter Elieser Hernández (2-1) settled down after a difficult second and limited Seattle to three runs over five innings. Hernández scattered five hits, struck out five and walked one.

Tim Anderson had two hits for the White Sox, who have dropped 10 of 11. 
Los Angeles pitchers retired 18 straight White Sox batters on a night when scheduled Angels starter Noah Syndergaard was scratched because of an undisclosed illness. Manager Joe Maddon said Syndergaard “wasn’t feeling well” before the game, but wouldn’t elaborate on the symptoms. 
Jimmy Herget stepped in to start after Noah Syndergaard was scratched and tossed three innings, allowing a run and one hit. Austin Warren (2-0) followed with two perfect innings. Raisel Iglesias got the final two outs and his sixth save as the White Sox loaded the bases.

The Reds are off to their worst start since beginning 3-18 in 2018, and dropped their fourth straight.
