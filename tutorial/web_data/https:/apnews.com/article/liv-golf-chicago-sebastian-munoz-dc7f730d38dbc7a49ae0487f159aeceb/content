SUGAR GROVE, Ill. (AP) — Sebastian Munoz quickly pulled away from a crowd at the top on Saturday, playing his opening five holes in 5-under par on his way to a second-round 8-under 63 and a three-shot lead in LIV Golf-Chicago.
Munoz was part of a five-way tie for the lead after the first of three rounds. He started with three straight birdies at Rich Harvest Farms, then he holed out from 123 yards on the par-4 fifth hole for an eagle.
Munoz was at 13-under 129, three clear of Anirban Lahiri, who had a bogey-free 66.
Abraham Ancer birdied six holes in a seven-hole stretch late in his round for a 66, leaving him tied for third with Dustin Johnson (66) and Thomas Pieters (67). They were five shots behind.
Points leader Cameron Smith shot 71 and was 11 shots behind.
Brooks Koepka is the only player in LIV’s 48-man league who will be playing in the Ryder Cup next week. The PGA champion had a 69 and was eight shots back. Sergio Garcia, part of that five-way tie for the 18-hole lead, had a 73 to fall out of contention.
