ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) — Australia’s test wicketkeeper Alex Carey has equaled an international record with his eight catches Wednesday in a domestic one-day cricket match.
Carey held eight catches for South Australia state in a limited-overs win over Queensland in his first 50-over match since being replaced as Australia’s first-choice white ball wicketkeeper at the World Cup in India last year.
He took five catches off the bowling of Jordan Buckingham and equaled the List A world record with his eighth catch to dismiss Matt Kuhnemann.
Two other wicketkeepers have taken eight catches in a List A innings, both in England. Derek Taylor set the record playing for Somerset in 1982 and Worcestershire’s James Pipe matched it in 2021.
