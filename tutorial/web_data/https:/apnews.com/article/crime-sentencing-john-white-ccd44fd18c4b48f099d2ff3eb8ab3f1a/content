A Kalispell man will likely die in prison after being sentenced Thursday for raping a young girl.
Christopher John White, 66, was sentenced to 50 years in Montana State Prison and will not be eligible for parole for 25 years - when he would be 91 years old.
Deputy Flathead County Attorney John Donovan said White took advantage of a vulnerable child, preyed upon her and hid it from the rest of the world. Donovan also stated that during the investigation, it was found that White had committed the crime of rape before.
The crime White was sentenced for happened between 2015 and 2017 during the time the child was 8 to 10 years old, according to court documents. Child pornography was also reportedly found in White’s property.
Two witnesses testified at White’s sentencing on the victim’s behalf.
They recalled the “nightmarish” consequences White’s actions have had on the little girl, and vowed to erase White from their lives as though he never existed. The witnesses also said they would see that the child “has the help she needs to be a strong, happy girl.”
During the testimonies, White was also called a “monster in plain sight.”
Flathead District Court Judge Robert B. Allison followed an Alford Guilty plea deal for the felony offense of sexual intercourse without consent. White will be designated as a level 2 sex offender and would be required to complete sex offender treatment before becoming eligible for parole.
