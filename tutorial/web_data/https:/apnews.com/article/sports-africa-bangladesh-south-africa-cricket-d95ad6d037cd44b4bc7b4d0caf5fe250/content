CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (AP) — South Africa wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock has been fined 75 per cent of his match fee for shoulder-barging Bangladesh batsman Tamim Iqbal.
The incident happened on the second day of the first test on Wednesday, and the fine announced Thursday.
De Kock pleaded guilty to the charge laid by match referee Chris Broad, with no formal hearing required.
Broad said de Kock confronted the Bangladesh opener and “deliberately brushed Tamim Iqbal’s shoulder and rib area. This resulted in a heated exchange between the two, initiated by the contact made by de Kock. This type of incident has no place on a cricket field.”
South Africa’s Rilee Rossouw was fined 50 percent of his match fee for an altercation with the same batsman in the one-day series.
