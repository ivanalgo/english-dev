BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota Republican Gov. Doug Burgum said Saturday that election workers in the GOP-run state should be allowed to begin processing absentee ballots five days before the Nov. 3 election.
Burgum said in a release he signed an executive order to give workers enough time to verify voter information and “ensure election integrity and timely results” on voting day.
The North Dakota County Auditors Association submitted the request to allow local election boards a head start. Actual counting will not begin until after the polls close on election day.
The Secretary of State’s Office on Saturday reported that more than 205,000 absentee and mail ballots for the 2020 general election have been sent out to eligible voters. That’s a 100% increase from the 2018 election and a 130% increase from 2016. Citizens cast a record 159,397 ballots by mail during the June primary.
“Without this extension, and with the increased volume of absentee and mail ballots counties are expecting, results could be delayed not by hours but maybe even days,” said Donnell Preskey Hushka, executive director for the North Dakota County Auditors Association. 
The North Dakota Republican Party has dominated elections in recent years and currently holds all state offices and an overwhelming majority in the Legislature.
