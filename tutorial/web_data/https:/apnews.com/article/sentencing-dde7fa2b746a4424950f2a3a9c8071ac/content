A sentencing hearing begins today for a San Antonio man convicted in June of beating a man to death with a baseball bat, dismemebering him and then burning his limbs on a barbecue pit.
Daniel Moreno Lopez was convicted of murder in June in the killing and dismemberment of Jose Luis Menchaca, 35, on Sept. 30, 2014. The killing allegedly was in retaliation for Menchaca stabbing Lopez two days before over a drug deal that went sour.
He is one of three people charged in the killing and the first to go to trial. Th trial of his cousin and co-defendant, Gabriel Moreno, was completed in March but ended in mistrial when the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict after four days of deliberations.
Candie Dominguez, Lopez’s then-girlfriend, is awaiting trial.
Lopez will be sentenced by state District Judge Ron Rangel after a pre-sentencing investigation hearing with witnesses from both prosecutors and defense attorneys that is expected to last a few days.
He faces five to 99 years or life in prison.
The hearing is being held in the 379th state District Court.
