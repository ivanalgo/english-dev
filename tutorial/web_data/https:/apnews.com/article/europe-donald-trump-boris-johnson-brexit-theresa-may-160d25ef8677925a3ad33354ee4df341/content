President Trump wasn’t fazed Monday by political turmoil in the British government, ahead of his visit this week to the U.K., said the White House.
“The President continues to look forward to his working visit with the Prime Minister on July 13, and further strengthening the U.S.-U.K. special relationship,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government was rocked Monday by the abrupt resignation of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, deepening the crisis over Brexit for Mrs. May.
Mr. Johnson, an outspoken champion of Britain’s exit from the European Union, quit over Mrs. May’s Brexit plan, which critics say is not a complete break with Brussels.
The U.K. voted for Brexit two years ago, but the break with the EU has been repeatedly delayed.
Mr. Johnson quit just hours after the resignation late Sunday of Brexit Secretary David Davis, the government’s top Brexit official.
Mr. Trump is set for a two-day whirlwind visit to the U.K. that starts Thursday and includes talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May and an audience with Queen Elizabeth II.
