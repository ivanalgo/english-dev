TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Jonathan Schoop’s two-run homer helped give the Netherlands a spot in the next round of the World Baseball Classic with a 4-1 victory over Australia on Tuesday.
The win gave the Dutch a 2-1 record in Group B and made sure they will play in the second round in Tokyo. Schoop’s homer capped a three-run second inning for the Dutch.
Starting pitcher Robbie Cordemans allowed two hits in five innings.
Host Taiwan faced South Korea later Tuesday in a game that will determine which of the two teams advanced to Tokyo. Australia finished at 0-3.
Brad Harman had a ninth-inning drive to left for Australia with two on that was snagged on the warning track by Randolph Oduber, preserving the Dutch win.
