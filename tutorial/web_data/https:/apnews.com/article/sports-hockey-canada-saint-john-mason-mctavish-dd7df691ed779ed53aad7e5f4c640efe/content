broke a third-period tie
 with Shawinigan’s third power-play goal, Antoine Coulombe made 38 saves and the Cataractes beat the Hamilton Bulldogs 3-2 on Wednesday night in the Memorial Cup.
Xavier Bourgault and Mavrik Bourque also scored and assisted on Nadeau’s winner to help Quebec Major Junior Hockey League champion Shawinigan improve to 2-0 with a game left in round-robin play.
Nadeau gave Shawinigan the lead at 7:06 of the third, tipping Bourque’s pass from left side past goalie Marco Costantini from the deep slot.
Mason McTavish and Avery Hayes scored for Ontario Hockey League champion Hamilton (0-2). Costantini stopped 31 shots.
