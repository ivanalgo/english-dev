LYNDON, Vt. (AP) — Town officials in Lydon have approved up to $25,000 for maintenance of a 41-year-old ice arena that a nonprofit hopes to reopen.
The Fenton Chester Arena was closed last year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The selectboard voted 3-0 this week to approve the funding for the Fenton Chester Arena, the Caledonian Record 
reported. 
The nonprofit RINK Inc., short for Rescue Ice Hockey In The Northeast Kingdom, was formed to reopen the ice arena and preserve youth hockey in Caledonia County. 
“This is a huge piece of the puzzle,” RINK Inc. Director Scott Beck said of the maintenance funding. 
The $25,000 will be used for repairs of the roof, ceiling and the water softening system; replacement of bathroom fixtures; and electrical code compliance, the newspaper reported. 
The hope is the state will provide a matching grant.
RINK Inc. has also launched a $35,000 fundraising campaign for start-up costs to re-open the rink to cover liability insurance, staffing, day-to-day operations and utility bills. It hopes to reopen the arena in October.
