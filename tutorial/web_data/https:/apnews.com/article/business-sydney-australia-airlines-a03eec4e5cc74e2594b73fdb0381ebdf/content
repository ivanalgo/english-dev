American Airlines says it will start flying between Los Angeles and Sydney in December as part of an expansion of its partnership with Australian carrier Qantas.
The daily nonstops will start Dec. 17. Three days later, Qantas Airways will add up to six flights a week between Sydney and San Francisco. The carriers will share revenue from each otherâ€™s flights.
The CEOs of the airlines announced the new flights Tuesday at an industry conference in Miami. They said the deal could lead to flights to New Zealand or other Pacific destinations.
American will compete on the Los Angeles-Sydney route with another partnership, Delta and Virgin Australia, and United Airlines.
