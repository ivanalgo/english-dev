Sunday is the five-year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy, which caused massive property damage, power outages and five deaths in the region. One of those who died in the disaster was Easton volunteer firefighter Lt. Russell Neary, who was killed by a falling tree while responding to a call.
The Easton Volunteer Fire Department paid tribute to Neary on its Facebook page Sunday, with a heart felt message of remembrance. “We can’t believe it’s been 5 years since Russ bravely went out on a call during Hurricane Sandy and died in the line of duty keeping the Town of Easton safe,” the post reads. “Russ was a great president who couldn’t do enough for the fire company, his friends ,family and the town of Easton. He was a great role model. He was always the first person signing on for a fire call. We were all very lucky to have Russ as a friend.”
The post goes on to mention that the fire firefighters were meeting up Sunday to remember Neary.
