TORONTO (AP) — Toronto Maple Leafs forward James van Riemsdyk is expected to miss six to eight weeks because of a non-displaced fracture in his left foot.
The 26-year-old left wing has 29 points (14 goals, 15 assists) in 40 games this season.
Van Riemsdyk was a minus-3 and played just under 16 minutes in Toronto’s last game, a 7-0 loss at San Jose on Saturday night.
The Maple Leafs also announced Monday that forward Josh Leivo has been recalled from the Toronto Marlies. He has 30 points (11 goals, 19 assists) in 35 games for the American Hockey League club this season.
The Maple Leafs host the Columbus Blue Jackets on Wednesday.
