BANGOR, Maine (AP) — The sentencing of a former Maine college basketball star on child pornography charges has been postponed.
Dana Wilson of Brewer was scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday, but the hearing was delayed until Aug. 20 because his psychologist had a scheduling conflict and was unable to appear in court.
The 62-year-old Wilson’s lawyer says it’s important the psychologist testify because Wilson was “dealing with a lot of stressful personal events” in his life at the time of the offense, including the breakup of his marriage.
Wilson was found guilty in May of possessing child porn.
Wilson averaged an NCAA Division III best nearly 35 points a game his senior year at Husson College in 1974. He was inducted into the Maine Sports Hall of Fame last year, but his induction has been revoked.
