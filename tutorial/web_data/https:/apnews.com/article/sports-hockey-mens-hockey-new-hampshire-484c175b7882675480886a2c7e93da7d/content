DURHAM, N.H. (AP) — University of New Hampshire Director of Athletics Marty Scarano says he will retire following the 2021-2022 academic year. 
Scarano is in his 22nd year at UNH and his 41st in college athletics. 
“I have cherished the privilege of working alongside many, many talented and dedicated colleagues who care as deeply about this University as I do,” Scarano said in a statement on Monday. “Most of all, I am so very proud of our student-athletes and am honored to have shared in each and every one of their accomplishments over the years.”
During Scarano’s tenure, the Wildcats have captured 60 league championships, produced more than 100 All-Americans and had 61 conference coach of the year recipients. UNH also had one national champion — Elle Purrier in the indoor mile in 2018 — and a national championship runner-up in men’s hockey in 2003. 
Other highlights include the construction and 2016 opening of the $27 million multi-purpose Wildcat Stadium and the $2 million Watkins Center for Student-Athlete Excellence at the Field House.
 A national search to find a new athletics director will start immediately, university President James Dean said.
