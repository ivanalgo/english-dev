PARCHMAN, Mississippi (AP) — An inmate in the state of Mississippi has been put to death for killing two men in a December 1995 robbery spree after the courts declined to stop the execution based on arguments that he was mentally ill.
Authorities say 38-year-old Edwin Hart Turner died after an injection at 6:21 p.m. local time Wednesday for conviction in the slayings of Eddie Brooks and Everett Curry during a pair of gas station holdups. The spree netted Turner and accomplice Paul Murrell Stewart about $400.
Stewart was sentenced to life in prison after testifying against Turner.
Some relatives of both victims witnessed the execution, making no immediate comments.
Turner’s lawyers had unsuccessfully urged courts to block the execution, arguing officials prevented the inmate from getting medical tests that could prove he was mentally ill at the time.
