MULTAN, Pakistan (AP) — Peshawar Zalmi’s first win came at the expense of Pakistan Super League leader Multan Sultans in a five-run nailbiter on Friday.
Peshawar totalled 179-8 after it won the toss, and Multan was all out for 174. Multan still led the six-team table on run rate after its first home loss in four matches.
Needing 22 off the final over, Multan’s Iftikhar Ahmed cracked two boundaries and a big six off Naveen-ul-Haq, leaving the target to six off the last two balls. The Afghan fast bowler, playing his first PSL game of the season, kept his cool and had Ahmed caught behind after a video referral, then used the last ball to clean-bowl last man Shahnawaz Dahani.
Multan’s run chase was powered by Dawid Malan, who made a blistering 52 off 25 balls. Reeza Hendricks, with 28, played an anchor role in a 70-run stand with Malan, who smashed three sixes and three fours.
The batters fell in quick succession, and leg-spinner Arif Yaqoob undermined Multan further when he took three wickets in an eventful 17th over. Usama Mir hit Yaqoob for two successive sixes, and David Willey was dismissed by a terrific catch on the boundary by substitute fielder Dan Mousley.
Earlier, Peshawar was launched by Haseebullah Khan’s quickfire 37 off 18 balls and Babar Azam’s 31.
The death overs were also vital as Rovman Powell’s 23 off 11 and Luke Wood’s 17 off 12 proved vital in the end.
