Northwestern
 has been added to a long list of American universities to face a 
scandal
 in athletics and may eventually join the trend of making large payouts following allegations of sexual abuse.
A former Wildcats football player filed the first lawsuit against 
Pat Fitzgerald
 and members of the school’s leadership Tuesday, seeking damages stemming from 
a hazing scandal
 that cost the former football coach his job.
Here is a look at other schools that have had sexual-related scandals in athletics:
— The University of Michigan last year had a financial payout of $490 million 
for more than 1,000 people
 who say they were sexually assaulted by the late sports doctor Robert Anderson.
— 
Ohio State University
 agreed in 2020 to more than $46 million in settlements for more than 185 people who alleged sexual abuse from team doctor Richard Strauss.
— Dartmouth College in New Hampshire announced in 2019 that it had settled a federal lawsuit for 
$14 million
 with nine women who sued the Ivy League school over allegations that it ignored years of harassment and assault by former psychology department professors. 
— Michigan State University’s $500 million 
agreement in 2018 was to settle claims
 of more than 300 women and girls who said they were assaulted by Larry Nassar, who also was a doctor for USA Gymnastics.
— Baylor University in Texas 
settled a federal Title IX lawsuit
 in 2018 that was brought by a former volleyball player who alleged that she was drugged and gang-raped by at least four football players in 2012. The terms of the settlement with the woman, identified in court papers only as Jane Doe, were not disclosed. 
— Penn State University paid out 
more than $100 million
 in 2017 to more than 40 people who said they were sexually abused by former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky.
