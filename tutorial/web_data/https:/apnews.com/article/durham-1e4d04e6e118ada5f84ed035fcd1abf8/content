Michael Lawson remembered Shareef Abdul Mohammed as someone who loved to win and never complained.
“He was one of my favorite athletes,” said Lawson, the head track coach at N.C. Central University.
Mohammed, 29, was killed in November during a home invasion at his residence on the 1300 block of Rosewood Street.
Two unidentified men with guns forced their way into the home, attempted to rob those inside and shot Mohammad, who later died, police said.
No arrests have been made.
Mohammed earned All-American honors as a member of NCCU’s track team in 2004 and 2007.
After college, he volunteered with the Triangle Champions Track Club.
“An extraordinary life was taken from us, and they did not rob him, they robbed us,” said Allison Kalloo, a friend of Mohammed. “I can’t wrap my head around any of this. I can’t wrap my head around talking about him in the past tense.”
Kalloo said her son and others were inside the Rosewood Street home at the time of the robbery. She added that Mohammed died protecting others inside the residence.
“You don’t come across people like that everyday,” she said. “I can’t wrap my head around any of this. I can’t wrap my head around talking about him in the past tense.”
Anyone with information about the crime is asked to call 1-866-439-2683.
