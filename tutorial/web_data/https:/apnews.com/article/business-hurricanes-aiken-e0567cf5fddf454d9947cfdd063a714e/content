With Hurricane Florence surging closer to the coast of South Carolina, assisted living and rehabilitation centers in Aiken are opening their doors to evacuees with medical needs.
Benton House of Aiken is expecting residents from one or two other South Carolina locations, according to Deanna Hoyt-Zoeller, executive director at Benton House of Aiken.
She said things are going to be changing minute-to-minute, but if residents from two other communities come to the Benton House, it would be around 100 people.
Benton House has locations in Charleston and Bluffton.
Hoyt-Zoeller at the Benton House said the Red Cross has provided cots and blankets to help with evacuees.
Providing a place for people to stay provides them somewhere they can be healthy, safe and cared for by people who understand their needs, she said.
“One, it’s the right thing to do, and two, some folks don’t have a place to go or they can’t get to family within a timely manner with the hurricane,” she said.
Anchor Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center of Aiken is also providing a place for evacuees from other facilities to stay.
Inquiries were made to Aiken Regional Medical Centers for this story, but were not returned by press time.
