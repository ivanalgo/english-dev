BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — A warm-up game between Ireland and Colombia ahead of the 
Women’s World Cup
 was abandoned after only 20 minutes Friday because of what the Irish said was the “overly physical” nature of the match.
Ireland said in a statement the behind-closed-doors game in Brisbane was called off after consultation with match officials, and the team then held a full training session on the field instead.
Ireland midfielder Denise O’Sullivan was taken to the hospital with a shin injury sustained during the match. Two Colombia players received yellow cards in the opening 19 minutes.
Ireland Football later 
said in a tweet
 that an x-ray and CT scan on O’Sullivan’s injury showed no fracture and that she would work with the team’s medical staff on a “return to play” procedure. It did not say whether O’Sullivan would play in Ireland’s opening World Cup match in Sydney against Australia next Thursday, the opening day of the tournament.
Media and the public were reportedly not allowed to attend the Brisbane game.
