SYDNEY (AP) â€” Serbia international striker Ranko Despotovic has been signed by Sydney FC until the end of the A-League season.
Despotovic played for Japanese club Urawa Red Diamonds last season and has represented clubs in the top leagues in Serbia and Romania.
He also spent three seasons in the Spanish second division with Murcia and Salamanca and has played four times for Serbia.
Sydney, which has won just one of its opening four matches, said Friday that the 30-year-old free agent will join the team next week and could make his debut against the Wellington Phoenix on Nov. 23.
