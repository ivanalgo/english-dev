The United States faces a difficult task to advance past group play at the Copa America after a 2-1 loss to Panana on Thursday night in Atlanta.
Here are some scenarios that would allow the Americans to play in the quarterfinals as one of the top two teams from Group C: 
— The U.S. must beat 15-time Copa champion Uruguay on Monday in Kansas City, Missouri, if Panama beats Bolivia in a game that will be played at the same time in Orlando, Florida. Bolivia has lost 14 straight Copa games after a 5-0 loss to Uruguay on Thursday.
— The U.S. could advance with a tie against Uruguay if Panama and Bolivia also play to a draw and the Americans have a better goal difference than Panama. The Americans would advance with a tie if Bolivia beats Panama.
— The U.S. could advance even with a loss to Uruguay if Bolivia beats Panama and the Americans have a better goal differential than Panama and Bolivia. The U.S. is plus-one, Panama minus-one and Bolivia minus-seven after Thursday’s games.
