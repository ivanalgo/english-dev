SYDNEY (AP) — Winless India received a boost when its tri-series one-day cricket international against Australia on Monday was abandoned because of rain.
The washout at the Sydney Cricket Ground on the Australia Day national holiday meant both Australia and India took two points from the match.
Australia had already qualified for the final in Perth on Sunday and India’s windfall meant it stayed alive in the series: the winner of its round-robin match against England on Friday will claim the other finals place.
India was 69-2 after 16 overs when rain ended play on Monday.
Ishant Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja had returned to the India lineup after recent injuries while Rohit Sharma was not considered because of a hamstring strain. George Bailey returned to captain Australia after a one-match suspension.
