LONDON (AP) — England has postponed its six-match cricket tour of Bangladesh, originally scheduled for September and October, until March 2023.
The England and Wales Cricket Board said Tuesday it and the Bangladesh Cricket Board mutually decided to reschedule the tour, which includes three one-day internationals and three Twenty20s.
Although the statement gave no reason for the postponement, England media said a packed scheduled along with COVID-19-related quarantine protocols were behind the rescheduling. It also added that it would give England players an opportunity to resume playing for their Indian Premier League teams around the same time.
England’s top players are preparing for the first test against India at Trent Bridge which begins on Wednesday. The teams are set for a five-test series also including matches at Lord’s, Headingley and the Oval before concluding with a match at Old Trafford in Manchester from Sept. 10.
