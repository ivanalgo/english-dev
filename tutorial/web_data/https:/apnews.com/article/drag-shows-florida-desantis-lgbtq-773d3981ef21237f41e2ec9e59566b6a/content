ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A trial to determine if a new Florida law 
targeting drag shows
 is constitutional won’t start until next spring.
A filing posted in federal court in Tallahassee late last week shows that the trial won’t start until the beginning of June 2024. It is scheduled to last two days and will be decided by a judge instead of a jury.
The law, championed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, is on hold for now. A federal judge last month issued 
a temporary injunction
 preventing it from being enforced until the trial is held. The state of Florida has appealed that decision. 
Last week, U.S. District Judge Gregory Presnell issued an order 
clarifying
 that the injunction applied to all venues in Florida, not just the restaurant that had sued the state challenging the law’s constitutionality.
The new law punishes venues for allowing children into “adult live performances.” Although it does not specify drag shows, the sponsor of the legislation said it was aimed at those performances. Venues that violate the law face fines and the possibility of their liquor licenses being suspended or revoked. Individuals could also be charged with a misdemeanor crime.
The 
lawsuit
 was brought by the owner of a Hamburger Mary’s restaurant and bar in Orlando, which regularly hosts drag shows, including family-friendly performances on Sundays that children were invited to attend. The restaurant owner said the law was overbroad, was written vaguely and violated First Amendment rights by chilling speech.
Before announcing his candidacy for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, DeSantis made 
anti-LGBTQ+ legislation
 a large part of his agenda as governor. Other bills he signed would ban gender-affirming care for minors and restrict discussion of personal pronouns in schools.
