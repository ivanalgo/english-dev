TURNOVER DIFFERENTIAL: Eagles 0; Washington minus-7
EAGLES PLAYER TO WATCH: RB Boston Scott may have to be carry the load for the league’s top-ranked rushing offense because of injuries to Miles Sanders and Jordan Howard. Scott had 41 yards and one TD on 12 carries last week. 
WASHINGTON PLAYER TO WATCH: DT Daron Payne and the rest of the defensive line needs to be much better than the past two weeks to keep Eagles QB Jalen Hurts from lighting up a banged-up secondary. If Payne and Jonathan Allen can be game changers, this can be a game.
KEY MATCHUP: Philadelphia’s running game against Washington’s front seven. The Eagles rushed for 238 yards in the team’s last meeting, and even with injuries that’s as much about the offensive line and holes in Washington’s defense than anything else.
KEY INJURIES: Sanders is out with a broken hand. Howard (stinger) is uncertain. ... Washington could be without RB Antonio Gibson because of a toe injury he suffered in the last Eagles game. S Landon Collins (foot) is out for the remainder of the season.
