The University of Wisconsin women’s hockey team’s Fill the Bowl game at the Kohl Center on Jan. 14 was announced as a sellout hours before faceoff.
That made the official attendance 15,359, the largest ever for a women’s hockey game in the United States. The formal total represents the number of tickets sold or distributed.
At game time, however, there were still questions on how many of the $1 tickets would be used.
The final total was 10,247, meaning more than 5,000 Kohl Center seats were empty.

Nonetheless, it was the largest crowd to see a Badgers women’s hockey game and contributed to the team’s best season for actual attendance in at least the last 11 years.
In 19 home games this season, the average number of tickets used was 2,108.
In 10 previous seasons of data since UW started using digital scanners to validate and count tickets at the turnstiles, the high average was 1,715 in 2010-11.
The Badgers led the nation in announced home attendance in the 2016-17 season, averaging 2,911 per game. The average number of no-shows was 803.
Counting only the 18 games at 2,273-seat LaBahn Arena this season, the average actual crowd was 1,656, with 564 no-shows.
The percentage of tickets purchased or distributed for Badgers women’s hockey games that goes unused has shrunk in recent seasons, especially since UW opened LaBahn in 2012.

        
    
Roughly half of tickets were unused in the six seasons between 2006-07 and 2011-12, when the Kohl Center was the Badgers’ home rink.
In five seasons since LaBahn Arena opened, the no-show rate has dropped to 32 percent.
The largest crowd at LaBahn this season was 2,034 for the NCAA tournament game against Robert Morris on March 11.
The smallest was 1,154 for a Sunday afternoon game against North Dakota on Jan. 22. The Green Bay Packers played the NFC Championship Game that day.
