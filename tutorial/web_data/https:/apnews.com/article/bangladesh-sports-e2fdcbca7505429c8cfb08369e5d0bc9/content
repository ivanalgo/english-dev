CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (AP) — Mominul Haque smashed a half-century to help Bangladesh recover from the quick loss of two wickets and reach 103-2 at stumps on the second day of the first test on Thursday.
In response to New Zealand’s first inning’s 469, Bangladesh made a sluggish start but Haque’s stormy batting brought Bangladesh back on track.
Bangladesh lost its two openers by the fourth over, with Tamim Iqbal going for a duck and Anamul Haque on 3.
Mominul amassed 77 off 13 boundaries while his partner Marshall Aiyub was unbeaten on 21.
For New Zealand, B.J. Watling scored his second test century and added 127 runs with Trent Boult in their last-wicket stand.
Bangladesh took five wickets on the day to dismiss New Zealand, which resumed on 280-5.
