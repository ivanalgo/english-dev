TROON, Scotland (AP) — Here’s a look at the British Open going into the last round at Royal Troon. Golf’s oldest championship is at this century-old links of Royal Troon for the 10th time. This is golf’s final major championship of the year. Here’s what you need to know:
Golf coverage in the United States comes on nearly six hours before the leaders tee off. 
The final round starts on USA Network from 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. EDT, and then shifts over to NBC Sports from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The R&A also has 
free streaming
 that provides coverage of a featured group, along with coverage of the famous “Postage Stamp” eighth hole at Royal Troon.
Billy Horschel has a one-shot lead over six players — PGA champion Xander Schauffele, Justin Rose, Daniel Brown in his major champion debut, Russell Henley, Sam Burns and Thriston Lawrence. Masters champion Scottie Scheffler was another shot back.
Burns and Lawrence each shot 65, Henley a 66. They had the advantage of playing most of their round before 
the weather turned nasty. 
Horschel and rest 
felt like they were in a survival test
 because of steady rain and then wind into their faces on the brutal back nine of Royal Troon.
Of the contenders, Brown in the biggest surprise because he is 
playing his first major.
Scheffler started as 
the overwhelming favorite
 as the No. 1 player with six wins against the strongest fields this year. Going into the final round, 
BetMGM Sportsbook
 has him listed at +375 behind the new favorite, Xander Schauffele at +350.

        
    
Billy Horschel is listed at +450, followed by Justin Rose and Sam Burns at +800.
Daniel Brown is at +2000 and Shane Lowry is +2500.
The R&A has raised the prize fund to $17 million, up $500,000 from last year but still the lowest of the four major championships.
R&A CEO Martin Slumbers is not about to get into an 
arms race
 with the other majors.
First prize gets $3.1 million. Here’s how the payout works for the rest of the top 10:
Second place: $1,759,000
Third place: $1,128,000
Fourth place: $876,000
Fifth place: $705,000
Sixth place: $611,000
Seventh place: $525,000
Eighth place: $442,500
Ninth place: $388,000
Tenth place: $350,600

“That’s the hardest nine holes I think you could ever play in golf right now.” — Dustin Johnson.
“Look, there’s no doubt I’m going to go out there tomorrow thinking I can win the tournament, but it’s just hard right now. Ten minutes ago I had to putt for par on the 18th green, and I’m here talking to you guys now trying to figure out how I shot 77 in my own head.” — Shane Lowry.
“Something I’ve done this year is sort of manifest seeing myself holding the trophy before I go to sleep every night, envisioning myself holding that trophy on 18, walking out to the crowd and being congratulated as Open champion. That’s what I’m going to do again tonight, and hopefully that comes true tomorrow. If it doesn’t, then I’ll get back on the grind and work harder to get back in a position like this again.” — Billy Horschel.
— A win by Justin Rose would set the record for longest span between winning majors at 4,053 days. The record currently belongs to Julius Boros, who went 4,026 days between winning the 1952 U.S. Open and the 1963 U.S. Open.
— An American winning would give them a sweep of the majors for the first time since 1982 when Craig Stadler won the Masters, Tom Watson won the U.S. Open and British Open, and Raymond Floyd won the PGA Championship. So far this year, Scottie Scheffler has won the Masters, Xander Schauffele the PGA Championship and Bryson DeChambeau the U.S. Open.
— Daniel Brown or Justin Rose winning would make them the first player to win the British Open after going through 36-hole qualifying since Paul Lawrie in 1999.
Rory McIlroy goes another year without a major. What next?
