PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A 21-year-old man was fatally shot Thursday night after what Philadelphia Police said appeared to be a road rage incident.
Officers responded to a call around 6:30 p.m. Thursday reporting a person with a gun and shooting in the East Falls section of the city.
Police said Eddie Rodriguez was a passenger in a car being driven by his brother on the highway when another car rear-ended them. Philadelphia Chief Inspector Scott Small told

 the cars pulled over to exchange insurance information, but the driver of the striking vehicle pulled alongside the brothers’ car and fired twice, striking Rodriguez in the chest.
Rodriguez was taken to the hospital where he died a short time later.
Police said four men were in the car, all wearing masks and that the gunshots came from the passenger side of that vehicle. Small said officers are looking for a dark colored car, but no suspects have been named as of Friday afternoon.
