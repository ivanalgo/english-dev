COATESVILLE, Pa. (AP) — A student at a high school near Philadelphia was taken to a hospital after a stabbing that prompted a lockdown at the school, authorities said.
Police were called to Coatesville Area Senior High School just before 7:30 a.m. Tuesday after a student was reported with a slash-type wound to the shoulder, the Daily Local News of West Chester 
reported
. Authorities later said he had been stabbed nine times and was rushed to a hospital, where he was reported in stable condition.
School police and Caln Township police placed the school and all other buildings on the property on lockdown. Authorities said the suspect was believed to be no longer at the school, and police were investigating. Anyone with surveillance cameras near the school was asked to review their footage.
Officials said students were being dismissed for the day, with the substitute superintendent Rick Dunlap calling the school “an active crime scene” and citing the need to allow police “time and space” to complete their investigation.
Dunlap called it an “extremely upsetting incident” and said school officials will follow up with counseling for students and staff on Wednesday.
