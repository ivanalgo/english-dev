Father John Misty, “I Love You, Honeybear” (Sub Pop)
Singer-songwriter Father John Misty’s meandering musical career seems to have settled reasonably well in the solo realm. His latest album, “I Love You, Honeybear,” offers a lush look at love, life and the curiosities that complicate it all.
Joshua Tillman, who performs as Father John Misty, sings beautifully when he’s not singing too much on the often wordy 11-track album. The lyrics are heavy, and perhaps only the literary cognoscenti will catch all his nuances.
If there’s a post-sadcore movement these days, Misty is its likely leader. He pens disaffected lyrics about relationships gone wrong and knows who to blame for their undoing. But often there’s barely any room for the music to breathe, as on “I Love You, Honeybear” and “Chateau Lobby #4.”
When Misty does pause for air, he’s fine on standout songs like “Bored in the USA.”
