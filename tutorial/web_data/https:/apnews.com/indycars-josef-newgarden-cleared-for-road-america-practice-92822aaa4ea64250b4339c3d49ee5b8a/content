ELKHART LAKE, Wis. (AP) — IndyCar driver Josef Newgarden is scheduled to practice at Road America, nearly two weeks after he broke his right collarbone in a scary crash at Texas.
Ed Carpenter Racing, owner of the Newgarden’s No. 21 Chevrolet, says the driver is cleared to practice on Friday. The team says Newgarden will be reevaluated after the practice sessions to determine what he can do the rest of the weekend.
The 202-mile Kohler Grand Prix on Sunday marks IndyCar’s first race at Road America since 2007. Ed Carpenter Racing says JR Hildebrand will drive the No. 21 car if Newgarden cannot go.
Newgarden got hurt in a race on June 12 at Texas after his car slammed on its side and slid along the frontstretch wall with the top of the cockpit exposed.
