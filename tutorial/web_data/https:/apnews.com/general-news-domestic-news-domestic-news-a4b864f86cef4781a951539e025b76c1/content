HOUSTON (AP) — The wife of a Jordanian-born man on trial for capital murder says her husband sneaked into their son-in-law’s Texas apartment before fatally shooting him in 2012.
The 
Houston Chronicle
 reports that 40-year-old Shmou Alrawabdeh testified Wednesday as part of a plea bargain to reduce her charges in the slaying of Coty Beavers. Her husband is also accused of killing Iranian women’s rights activist Gelareh Bagherzadeh, who encouraged their daughter to marry Beavers.
Alrawabdeh told the jury her husband, Ali Mahwood-Awad Irsan, slipped into Beavers’ unlocked apartment near Houston and shot him after their daughter left for work.
She says her husband, a conservative Muslim, believed the only way to recover his honor was to kill the Christian man his daughter ran away to marry.
Irsan’s lawyers deny the allegations.
Irsan could face the death penalty if convicted.
