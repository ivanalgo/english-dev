Shelby Lynne and Allison Moorer, “Not Dark Yet” (Silver Cross/Thirty Tigers)
It’s been said that something mystical distinguishes the harmonies forged by siblings from those of ordinary mortals, and nothing Shelby Lynne and Allison Moorer have sung together would prove otherwise.
Both critically acclaimed singer-songwriters in their own right, the two sisters with Alabama roots have been blending their voices to angelic effect for as long as they can remember. They just haven’t put out an album together.
Until now.
Their new release, “Not Dark Yet,” is a fine collection of carefully curated songs, each chosen to celebrate the seamless melding of two beautiful voices. Produced by Teddy Thompson, the album showcases the talent of sisters who figured out long ago how to complement each other musically.
The song choices, pitch-perfect for the most part, range from the title cut, Bob Dylan’s somber and understated reflection on aging, to an elegant version of Nick Cave’s “Into My Arms.” The only unfortunate choice is a leaden cover of Nirvana’s “Lithium,” which feels conspicuously misplaced.
Lynne and Moorer’s musical careers emerged from tragedy. Their father shot and killed their mother and then himself when they were teenagers. That’s not something the sisters dwell on publicly, and they won’t let it dominate their legacy.
But their tragic past helps explain the power of their voices in harmony. There’s an unspoken message of trust, a bond that transcends the songs themselves and hints at the deeper things that bind them together.
