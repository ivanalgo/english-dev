George Strait, “The Cowboy Rides Away: Live From AT&T Stadium” (MCA Nashville)
The 20-song “Cowboy Rides Away: Live From AT&T Stadium” documents what was billed as Country Music Hall of Fame member George Strait’s final concert. Held on June 7 in Arlington, Texas, the event was more celebration than concert — where the waves of cheers play as big of a role as the voices and musicians.
The guest-heavy lineup leans on modern stars such as Jason Aldean, Eric Church and Miranda Lambert more than Strait’s peers or influences. Several cuts are reduced to karaoke sing-alongs, with the guests providing harmony vocals or taking a single stanza. But memorable cuts surface, such as a powerful version of “A Showman’s Life,” with Faith Hill on backing vocals.
There are other special moments. Strait reveals a playful side on a spirited duet with the great Martina McBride on the Johnny Cash-June Carter hit “Jackson.” He and Alan Jackson stick up for country traditions on “Murder on Music Row.” And Strait finds new emotion, given the circumstances, in songs like “Give It All You Got Tonight.” The highlight is a spoken recitation in “I’ll Always Remember You,” when Strait thanks his fans for a career that far out-distanced his dreams.
This live record isn’t the place to sample Strait’s long list of hits. It is, however, a gift to those who hate to see this legendary cowboy ride off into the sunset.
