ATLANTA (AP) — The head of Georgia’s emergency management agency has been reassigned to a deputy position, months after becoming the public face of the state’s weak response to a January storm that trapped motorists on highways in metro Atlanta for hours.
Adjutant Gen. Jim Butterworth, who was appointed to lead the Georgia National Guard in 2011, will take over as director of the Georgia Department of Emergency Management.
The change was announced Monday as part of staff changes inside Gov. Nathan Deal’s administration before his second term.
Charley English has been with the Georgia Emergency Management Agency since 1996 and became its director eight years ago. English also is a past president of the National Emergency Management Association, which is comprised of top emergency response officials from each state.
Critics questioned Deal for keeping English in the role in the storm’s aftermath, but Deal said then that he wasn’t looking for a scapegoat. English also apologized for the state’s response, saying two days after the storm that he had “made a terrible mistake and put the governor in an awful position.”
Butterworth is a former Republican state senator who was commissioned through the Air Force ROTC program at the University of Georgia. Brig. Gen. Joe Jarrard has been appointed to replace Butterworth as adjutant general.
