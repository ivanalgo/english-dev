MIAMI (AP) — Angela Castro, an elder sister of Cuban leaders Fidel and Raul Castro, has died following a long illness, a sibling confirmed Wednesday.
Castro died early Tuesday in the Cuban capital, Havana, after living with Alzheimer’s disease for many years, Juanita Castro told The Associated Press from her home in Miami.
“Angelita” Castro, as she was known to those close to friends, was 88, the eldest of the seven Castro siblings.
The Cuban government did not immediately comment on the news Wednesday.
Castro died at a clinic where she had been staying, Juanita Castro said. She was unconscious and surrounded by her children at the time of her death. Her body was cremated and her ashes taken to the farm in eastern Cuba where she was born, Juanita Castro added. The farm has been converted into a museum.
Angela Castro was the daughter of Angel Castro, a Spanish immigrant to Cuba and his second wife, Lina Ruz.
Fidel Castro, 85, the Cuban revolutionary leader who led the country until 2006, is the couple’s third child. The country’s current president, Raul Castro, is the youngest, at 80.
