DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Ford Motor Co. says it’s hiring 800 more engineers, computer specialists and other salaried workers in the U.S.
Ford initially planned to hire 2,200 salaried workers this year, but says it will now hire 3,000 as demand for new vehicles grows. U.S. auto sales were up 8 percent to more than 7.8 million through June. Ford’s sales rose 14 percent.
Ford’s human resources chief, Felicia Fields, says the company lost 13,000 salaried workers in the U.S. when it was restructuring between 2006 and 2009. Some of those workers have returned, but many are new hires recruited from Motorola, Microsoft and other high-tech companies.
Fields says it’s difficult to find candidates with the right technical qualifications. The company is launching a new advertising and social media recruitment campaign this week.
