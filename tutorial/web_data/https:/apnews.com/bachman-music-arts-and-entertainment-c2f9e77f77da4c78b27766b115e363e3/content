Bachman, “Heavy Blues” (Linus Entertainment)
Where has THIS been for the past four decades?
Randy Bachman, who made classic rock history with Bachman-Turner Overdrive and The Guess Who, has recorded his best album since 1976.
The name says it all: heavy blues, delivered with help from an All-Star cast of guests, including Neil Young, Peter Frampton, Joe Bonamassa, Robert Randolph and Jeff Healey.
If this was 1975 and the radio still played rock, there might be a half-dozen hit singles on “Heavy Blues.” The opening track, “The Edge,” sounds like BTO playing a mashup of “You Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Yet” and The Who’s “Won’t Get Fooled Again.”
“Ton of Bricks” hits the listener as advertised; “Little Girl Lost,” a daddy-never-loved-me, now-I’m-a-hooker song, features some memorable, instantly recognizable fuzz-tone guitar from Young; and “Confessing to the Devil” features posthumous licks from Healey from a long-ago unreleased session with Bachman.
The catchiest track on the album is “Wild Texas Ride,” featuring a boogie drum beat over raw guitars and enough cowbells to make even Will Ferrell happy. It’s really good to see Bachman takin’ care of business again.
