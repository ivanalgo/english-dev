Sky Ferreira, “Night Time, My Time” (Capitol)
There has been plenty of talk about Sky Ferreira for quite some time now, despite the 21-year-old only having released two EPs over the last three years. That may have to do with the buzz she built following the release of “Everything is Embarrassing,” one of 2012’s top tracks. Or maybe it is because earlier this year she and her boyfriend were arrested for heroin possession.
However, her debut album should give people something else to focus on. “Night Time, My Time” opens with “Boys,” arguably the best track on the record. The lyrics are a bit clumpy and cliché — “Cross my heart and hope to die,” she sings — but the song is saved from being bubble gum by the chugging guitar and pounding drums.
“24 Hours” is a perfect pop rock song, complete with lyrics filled with angst yet juxtaposed with twinkling synth. And “Nobody Asked Me” continues with the exposed, tell-all lyrics — “Nobody asked me if I was OK,” Ferreira wails.
Ferreira has a grungy rock ‘n’ roll image, but ignore that and listen to her voice. It’s pure and clear and her singing seems effortless.
Ignore the headlines and listen to the music.
