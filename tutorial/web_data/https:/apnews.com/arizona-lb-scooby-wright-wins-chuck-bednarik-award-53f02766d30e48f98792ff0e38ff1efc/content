LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — Arizona linebacker Scooby Wright has won the Chuck Bednarik Award, given to the nation’s defensive player of the year.
The sophomore was presented with the award Thursday night during the College Football Awards Show at Disney.
He joins USC linebacker Rey Maualuga in 2008 as the only Pac-12 players to win the award. Wright also won the Lombardi Award on Wednesday night as the nation’s best lineman, and the Bronko Nagurski Award on Monday night as the top defensive player in college football. In addition, he was the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year.
Wright was selected over Bednarik finalists Vic Beasley of Clemson and Joey Bosa of Ohio State.
Pittsburgh defensive tackle Aaron Donald won the award in 2013.
