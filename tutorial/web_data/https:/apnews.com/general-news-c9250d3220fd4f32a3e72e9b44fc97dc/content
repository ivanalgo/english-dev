CHICAGO (AP) — The shooting rampage in Las Vegas has triggered grim memories for survivors of previous massacres.
There have been dozens of mass shootings since Adrian Littlefield was shot at the University of Texas some 50 years ago by a sniper perched high in a tower. Each time, he relives his own narrow escape from death.
Littlefield and other survivors of mass shootings like the one in Las Vegas say what got them through was leaning on family, friends and counselors.
Littlefield was among those injured in the 1966 clock tower shooting at the University of Texas.
He’s a 70-year-old preacher now.
