ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Orlando’s hope of having the world’s tallest roller coaster is one step closer to becoming reality.
Orange County’s board of commissioners granted zoning approval Tuesday night for the $500 million Skyplex Orlando project.
The unanimous vote means that developer Joshua Wallack and his family can go forward with plans to build the 570-foot “Skyscraper” coaster and surrounding entertainment complex on Orlando’s International Drive.
Several dozen people spoke about the plan at Tuesday’s standing room-only public hearing. The support included residents of some of International Drive’s closest residential neighborhoods, as well as business owners who said Skyplex would help revitalize the area.
Opposition led by neighboring Universal Orlando argued that the coaster, which would have a 450-foot drop, is too tall and would adversely change the culture of the tourist corridor.
