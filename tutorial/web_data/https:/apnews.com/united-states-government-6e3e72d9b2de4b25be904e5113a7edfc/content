WASHINGTON (AP) — Responding to a court order, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has directed its staff to complete work on a key safety report related to a never-completed nuclear waste dump in Nevada.
The commission order, issued Monday, follows an August ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which said the nuclear agency violated federal law by abruptly abandoning review of the proposed storage site at Nevada’s Yucca Mountain.
The appeals court ordered the NRC to continue work on the proposed waste site 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas until Congress directs otherwise or the agency runs out of money. The NRC says it has $11 million budgeted for the Yucca review, far less than needed to complete the five-volume study. Only one volume is finished.
