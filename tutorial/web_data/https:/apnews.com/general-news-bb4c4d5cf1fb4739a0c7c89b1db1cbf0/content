WASHINGTON (AP) — Sixteen female senators from both parties are calling on the NFL to adopt a zero-tolerance policy on domestic violence for its football players.
The senators say they are “shocked and disgusted” by the video showing former Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee and knocking her unconscious.
They wrote NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday.
Their letter says the senators are deeply concerned that a new policy he announced last month would let a player commit a violent act and return to the field after a six-game suspension. They say anyone who violently assaults a woman should not get a second chance to play in the NFL.
Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer put the letter together. It’s signed by 14 Democrats and two Republicans.
