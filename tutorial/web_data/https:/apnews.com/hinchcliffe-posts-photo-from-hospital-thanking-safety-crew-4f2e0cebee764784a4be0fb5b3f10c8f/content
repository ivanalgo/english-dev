INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — James Hinchcliffe was smiling and dressed in a hospital gown in his first photo since the brutal crash that knocked him out of the Indianapolis 500.
Hinchcliffe posted a photo Friday on Instagram of him in the gown and yellow socks, hooked to a portable IV. He is sidelined indefinitely after surgery on a life-threatening leg injury that occurred when a broken piece of his suspension pierced his left thigh after a hard crash Monday.
Hinchcliffe was in critical condition when he was rushed to the hospital amid concerns over massive blood loss.
Hinchcliffe wrote that he knows he has a long recovery ahead but was lucky to be surrounded by great doctors and friends. He also praised IndyCar’s medical staff and safety crew as “the best on earth.”
