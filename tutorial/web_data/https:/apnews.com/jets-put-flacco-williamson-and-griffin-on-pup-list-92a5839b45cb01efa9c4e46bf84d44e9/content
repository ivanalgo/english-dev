FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) â€” The New York Jets placed quarterback Joe Flacco, linebacker Avery Williamson and tight end Ryan Griffin on the physically unable to perform list Thursday.
Flacco, the Super Bowl MVP when he led Baltimore the 2012 NFL championship, is recovering from a serious neck injury that sidelined him for half of last season with Denver. He was released by the Broncos in March, underwent surgery in April, and the Jets signed him to a one-year deal in May. They hope he will be the backup to Sam Darnold.
Williamson, projected as a starter last year, tore up his knee in a preseason game and missed the season. He said last week he will be healthy for the 2020 season, which is supposed to kick off on Sept. 13 when the Jets play Buffalo.
Griffin is recovering from ankle surgery. He had five touchdown catches last season in 13 games for New York, and was signed to a three-year contract extension last November.
The Jets also announced tight end Dan Brown was placed on the non-football injury list, and rookie defensive lineman Domenique Davis was waived. 
Brown had seven catches for 72 yards and a touchdown last year, his first with New York after three in Chicago and one in Baltimore.
Davis was signed as an undrafted free agent out of UNC Pembroke.
