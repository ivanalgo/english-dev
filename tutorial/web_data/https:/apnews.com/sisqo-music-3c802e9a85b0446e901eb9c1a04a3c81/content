Sisqo, “Last Dragon” (Massenburg Media)
It’s been 14 years and a whole lot of thongs thrown on stage since R&B singer Sisqo’s last album. The flamboyant Dru Hill front man is back with “Last Dragon,” a consistent album that delivers some solid songs, though probably lacks the chart-topping zest he’s accustomed to.
Sisqo never dropped off the musical map completely since his 1999 hit, “Thong Song.” He’s had mixtape songs and other solo work to stay busy. With “Last Dragon,” Sisqo’s soulful, soaring vocals remain intact, emerging on tracks like “Let’s Get Down Tonight” and “Lovespell.”
With a little auto-tune here and some nice slow jams there, Sisqo has delivered a varied musical menu. Slow dance fans will appreciate “LIPS” while those looking to try out a few Sisqo-like dance moves will gravitate toward “A-List,” featuring rapper Waka Flocka Flame.
At this point in Sisqo’s career, some might have expected him to mail this one in. But there is a nice bit of R&B theme and precision to “Last Dragon,” proving Sisqo still has plenty of fire.
