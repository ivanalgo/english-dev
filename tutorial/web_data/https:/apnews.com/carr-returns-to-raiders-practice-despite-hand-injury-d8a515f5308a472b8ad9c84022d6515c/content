ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) — Derek Carr was a full participant in practice for the Oakland Raiders three days after leaving the season opener with an injured throwing hand.
Carr says he took about 99 percent of the snaps in practice Wednesday and expects to play Sunday against Baltimore. Carr left Oakland’s season-opening loss against Cincinnati in the second quarter after hurting his hand trying to stiff-arm Adam Jones on a scramble.
Carr says he initially feared the injury could be more serious, but the swelling died down by Monday and he was able to throw the ball with few limitations at practice. Carr says he has never missed a game because of injury at any level and does not plan to now.
