Lil Peep, “Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 2" (Columbia)
On late rapper Lil Peep’s second studio album, the first release since his November 2017 death, the young artist takes fans on a singsongy journey through a familiar haze of themes — death, drugs, isolation and broken relationships, among them. The topics loom large over every languorous turn of “Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 2,” making the set a natural follow-up to Peep’s 2017 studio debut.
Sonically, the albums are quite similar — somber but melodic, hovering at the intersection of where emo meets rap. A toxic combination of prescription drugs resulted in Peep’s death at age 21, so on his new album his lyrics aren’t just typical sad-rap fare, they give a glimpse into real-life tragedy. “It comes a time, everybody meets the same fate/I think I’m gonna die alone inside my room,” Peep sings on the introspective standout track “Life is Beautiful.”
When he sings “I gotta go right now.” on album opener “Broken Smile (My All),” Peep’s words carry the weight of a prediction proven true. As with his previous work, Peep’s sorrow is sugar-coated by peppy beats, like on the guitar-laced and catchy “Cry Alone,” where he fantasizes about burning down his old high school. “Tell the rich kids to look at me now,” he muses.
From the head-bob-inducing “16 Lines” to the bittersweet “Sex with My Ex,” one emotional song seems to roll into the next, ending with final track “Fingers,” where Peep signs off with these final bars: “I’m not gonna last here/I’m not gonna last long.”
As a whole, “Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 2" serves as a soft bed for wallowing in dark thoughts. Some will find it a relatable respite, while others will count it as, simply, a tough space to be in.
