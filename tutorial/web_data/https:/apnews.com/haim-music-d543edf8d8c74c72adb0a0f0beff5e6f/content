Haim, “Days Are Gone” (Columbia Records)
Siblings Este, Danielle and Alana Haim have been steadily gaining momentum with tour support slots for Mumford & Sons, Rihanna and Florence + the Machine. Their audience is mostly comprised of young girls who just want to rock out without giving up on their pop just yet.
“Days Are Gone,” the trio’s debut album, is slick and radio-friendly, thanks to producers Ariel Rechtshaid (Vampire Weekend, Usher) and James Ford (Florence + the Machine, Arctic Monkeys). The tracks are delivered with energy and confidence and catchy hooks are easy to come by. This album is instantly likable.
“Forever,” ’'Falling” and “Don’t Save Me” are upbeat jams laced with 1980s synth guitars, while “My Song 5" is gritty with its Muse-esque dark guitar licks and R&B vibe. “Let Me Go” is full of attitude, with the group showing off their perfect harmonies.
The album’s closing track, “Running If You Call My Name,” brings Haim’s anthemic pop-rock effort to a close with vulnerable lyrics and punchy vocals. These L.A.-based sisters are newcomers, but they’ve made quite an impact with this stunning debut.
