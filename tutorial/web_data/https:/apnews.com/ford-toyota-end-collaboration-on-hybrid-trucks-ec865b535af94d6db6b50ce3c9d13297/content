DEARBORN, Michigan (AP) — Ford and Toyota are ending joint research into hybrid systems for trucks and SUVs.
The companies said Tuesday that they will each develop the systems independently.
Ford and Toyota agreed to the partnership two years ago after the CEOs of both companies met by chance in an airport. Engineers talked frequently and paid visits to each other’s labs.
But Ford product development chief Raj Nair said both companies need to focus on finishing development and putting the systems into vehicles. Ford wants to offer hybrid trucks and SUVs by the end of the decade.
There is currently no full gas-electric hybrid system on the market for rear-wheel-drive vehicles like trucks. The hybrid systems in Ford and Toyota cars are made for front-wheel-drive vehicles and don’t have enough power for trucks.
