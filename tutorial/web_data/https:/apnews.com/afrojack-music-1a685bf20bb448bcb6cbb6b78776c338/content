Afrojack, “Forget the World” (Def Jam)
Electronic dance music favorite Afrojack wants to make people dance and it’s mission accomplished (if you’re under 25) with his 13-track debut album, “Forget the World.”
Beats come courtesy of the Grammy Award-winning DJ, while guests such as Wrabel, Chris Brown and Sting — yes, that’s right Sting — bring the vocals.
And showing why the 26-year-old’s remix skills have him on speed dial for Beyonce, Pitbull and Paris Hilton, he includes his remix of Thirty Second To Mars’ “Do or Die” as a bonus track on “Forget the World.”
Unfortunately the guest vocalists don’t leave much of an impression. Brown’s singing is nondescript in the high energy “As Your Friend,” while Wrabel talks about “never coming down” and “touching the sky” as he plays the piano to a backdrop of high octane beats on “Ten Feet Tall.”
If you’re not into loud, pulsating beats, however, there’s not much for you here apart from the wispy vocals of Sting on the pop-friendly “Catch Tomorrow,” which offers light relief.
Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa offer the album’s best moments. While some of the more “electronic” songs all sound a bit formulaic and meld into one after a while, Snoop’s “Dynamite” and Khalifa’s “Too Wild” manage to stand out. They’re energetic, bass driven and laden with dirty beats.
“Forget The World” will no doubt have the EDM kids punching the air in joy. Everyone else might want to punch something else.
