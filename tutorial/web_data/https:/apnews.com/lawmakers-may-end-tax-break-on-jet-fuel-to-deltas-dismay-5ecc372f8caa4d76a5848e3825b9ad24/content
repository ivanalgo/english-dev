ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia lawmakers may eliminate a tax break for all airlines buying jet fuel at the world’s busiest airport.
A bill filed in the House would cut the exemption at Atlanta’s Hartsfield Jackson Airport. Supportive lawmakers say it would help the state get federal money for aviation improvements throughout the state.
They also argue the credit shouldn’t be kept in place forever. A committee could soon approve the bill.
Representatives for Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines say it’s a tax increase that could hurt the airport’s competitiveness.
Lawmakers created the exemption in 2005 as Delta was facing bankruptcy and have extended it several times before making it permanent in 2012. The bill’s sponsor says Delta’s CEO is pushing for tax increases for transportation but opposes losing the airline’s benefit.
