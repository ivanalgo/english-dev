SEATTLE (AP) — A federal prosecutor says extra security for a Russian man charged with hacking into U.S. businesses should stay in place because prison officials say one of his lawyers illegally brought a cellphone into the Seattle facility.
Roman Seleznev’s lawyers have complained they can’t meet with him face to face, compromising their ability to defend him.
In a court document filed Wednesday, a prosecutor also says a U.S. marshal caught a lawyer holding a cellphone up to a screen separating Seleznev from the attorney in a courthouse cellblock so the inmate could speak to someone in Russian.
Seleznev lawyer Anna Goykhman denied doing anything inappropriate during her visits and called the accusation offensive.
A prison official says mail disguised as correspondence from the law firm has been intercepted. It was actually a letter from another Russian prisoner.
