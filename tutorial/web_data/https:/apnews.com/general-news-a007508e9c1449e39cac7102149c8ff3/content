FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) — A Fort Campbell soldier who suffered a traumatic brain injury has received the Silver Star for his actions to help evacuate wounded troops during a mission in Afghanistan in 2010.
After receiving the honor during a Friday ceremony at the Tennessee-Kentucky state line, Sgt. 1st Class Matthew Loheide (LOH'-hyd) of Patchogue, N.Y., immediately re-enlisted in the Army to serve other wounded warriors like him.
Several of Loheide’s former teammates returned to Fort Campbell to see him accept the military’s third-highest medal for valor, which he said was earned by everyone in his unit.
Loheide and others were injured when a bomb dropped on their position during the operation. Despite his injuries and under fire, Loheide marked a landing zone for helicopters to evacuate the wounded and led his soldiers to safety.
