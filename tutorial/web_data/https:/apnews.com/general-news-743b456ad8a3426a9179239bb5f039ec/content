COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The Latest on a defamation lawsuit against a neo-Nazi website operator (all times local):
12:30 p.m.
A federal judge has awarded $4.1 million to a Muslim-American radio host who accused a neo-Nazi website operator of falsely accusing him of terrorism.
U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Sargus Jr. had previously agreed to enter a default judgment against The Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin and his company.
On Wednesday Sargus ruled in favor of SiriusXM Radio show host Dean Obeidallah (oh-bee-DAHL'-ah) and his request for financial damages and for an injunction ordering the website to take down articles about Obeidallah.
Obeidallah says Anglin falsely labeled him the “mastermind” behind a deadly bombing at a concert in England.
Anglin hasn’t responded to the lawsuit, and his whereabouts are a mystery. His father, Greg Anglin, testified briefly Wednesday but wouldn’t talk about his son.

A federal judge will hear arguments Wednesday for the amount of monetary damages a Muslim-American radio host can recover against a neo-Nazi website operator who falsely accused him of terrorism.
SiriusXM Radio show host Dean Obeidallah (oh-bee-DAHL'-ah) is seeking more than $1 million in damages against The Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin, who hasn’t responded to Obeidallah’s libel lawsuit.
U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Sargus Jr. agreed last month to enter a default judgment against Anglin and his company.
Obeidallah says Anglin falsely labeled him the “mastermind” behind a deadly bombing at a concert in England.
Anglin’s whereabouts are a mystery. The Ohio native says he has lived abroad for years and claims it would be too dangerous for him to travel to the U.S. because of credible death threats.
