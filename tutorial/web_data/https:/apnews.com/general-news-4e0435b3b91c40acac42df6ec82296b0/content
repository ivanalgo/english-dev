WICHITA, Kan. (AP) â€” Federal prosecutors are seeking a 25-year prison sentence for a California man who made a hoax call that led police to fatally shoot a Kansas man following a dispute between online gamers.
The government argued in a filing Wednesday that 26-year-old Tyler Barriss has not shown sincere remorse. It called the scope, nature and deviousness of his criminal activity staggering, saying he risked innocent life each time he engaged in swatting.
Prosecutors contend some of the false calls to governmental entities were a form of domestic terrorism.
Barriss faces sentencing Friday in federal court in Wichita for making the false report resulting in a death. He has pleaded guilty to 51 charges related to fake calls and threats across the country.
The defense is seeking a 20-year prison sentence.
