INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Indianapolis 500 will have its first presenting sponsor at its 100th race in May.
On Thursday, officials announced the race will be called the Indianapolis 500 presented by PennGrade Motor Oil. The three-year deal will run through the 2018 race.
The parent company, D-A Lubricant, is based in nearby Lebanon, Indiana, and has a long history in IndyCars..
It sponsored racers in the 500 from 1955-58 and last year was a major associate sponsor for Graham Rahal, who finished second in points. It will continue to sponsor Rahal’s car this year, too.
Indianapolis Motor Speedway President Doug Boles said his grandmother worked for the company.
This year’s race is scheduled for May 29.
