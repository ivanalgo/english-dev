ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) â€” Sen. Al Franken has officially resigned from the Senate.
The Minnesota Democrat formally resigned Tuesday afternoon. It comes nearly a month after he announced his plans to leave Congress after a swirl of sexual misconduct allegations that began in November.
His departure sets the stage for current Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith to be sworn in on Wednesday to take over his seat.
Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton picked his second-in-command last month to replace Franken. Smith is also a Democrat and plans to run for the seat in a special election in November.
Franken joined the Senate in 2009 after winning a months-long recount. He held an event in Minneapolis last week to thank supporters and friends.
