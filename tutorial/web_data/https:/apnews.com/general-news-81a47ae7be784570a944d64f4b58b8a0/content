FITCHBURG, Wis. (AP) — The FBI says leads are drying up in the search for an Illinois fugitive spotted in south-central Wisconsin.
Police and FBI agents are searching for 33-year-old Paris Poe of Chicago. He was last seen at a Country Inn & Suites in Madison near the border with the town of Fitchburg on Thursday morning.
FBI spokesman G.B. Jones says police swarmed the hotel but missed Poe by 10 minutes. Jones says someone at the hotel apparently tipped Poe off, but he declined to elaborate.
Since Poe was on foot, authorities believe he’s still within a five- to six-mile radius of the hotel.
