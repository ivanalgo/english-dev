LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — Oregon State junior Brandin Cooks has won the Biletnikoff Award as the nation’s most outstanding wide receiver.
Cooks was presented with the award Thursday during the 23rd College Football Awards Show at Disney.
He becomes the second winner from Oregon State, joining Mike Hass from 2005.
Cooks finished the season with 120 catches for 1,670 yards and 13 touchdowns. He also had 31 receptions for more than 20 yards, most in the country among wide receivers. That all helped lead Oregon State to a spot in the Hawaii Bowl against Boise State.
Cooks beat out fellow finalists Mike Evans from Texas A&M and Sammy Watkins of Clemson.
