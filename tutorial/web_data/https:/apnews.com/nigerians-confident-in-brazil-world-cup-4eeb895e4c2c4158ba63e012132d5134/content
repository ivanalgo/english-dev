FORTALEZA, Brazil (AP) — Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama gave his unconditional support for next year’s World Cup in Brazil, saying the country should be ready to stage the tournament.
The Nigerian captain has played in two World Cups and could reach his third if Nigeria qualifies.
“I’ve had an opportunity to be in two World Cups, and I think Brazil should be ready in one year’s time,” Enyeama said Saturday. “I think it should. According to what I’ve seen the hotels are OK, the food is nice, the pitch is amazing, the organization, logistics — for me, it’s perfect.”
Enyeama’s endorsement comes amid a week of massive street protests that have centered partly on large spending for next year’s World Cup and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
“You’ve got security,” Enyeama added. “For me, I think it’s fine and I don’t really know what more might be necessary to be added. ... I guess it’s going to be a festival of football.
“For now with what I’ve seen, Brazil is almost there.”
Some have questioned the need to spend $3.5 billion on new and renovated football stadiums in a country with crumbling infrastructure and poor public services.
Overall World Cup spending has been estimated by the government at $13.3 billion.
Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi also lent support.
“I can’t ask for more,” he said. “The training pitch — all in all — I think Brazil is almost there and 80, 85 percent ready to go.”

        
    
Keshi declined to comment on the street protests that have also touched Confederations Cup venues with some fans inside raising banners in support.
“I’m not sure if I have been fully watching those demonstrations,” he said. “Honestly speaking, I cannot comment on this. ... I’m not here for that.”
