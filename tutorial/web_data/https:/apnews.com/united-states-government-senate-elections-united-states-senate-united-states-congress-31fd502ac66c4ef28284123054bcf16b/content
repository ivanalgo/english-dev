CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Hillary Clinton is expected to help raise campaign cash for Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire — an important place to maintain friends, should the former secretary of state choose to make a second bid for the White House.
Two Democrats with knowledge of the event confirmed Clinton will join Shaheen at a New York City fundraiser this week, but did not specify a date. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the fundraiser by name before it was announced.
Clinton won the 2008 New Hampshire presidential primary and will need to keep up alliances in the state if she chooses to run for president in 2016. She was also scheduled to host a Washington, D.C., fundraiser for New Hampshire state Sen. Lou D’Allesandro on Tuesday, but rescheduled due to the birth of her first grandchild.
Hillary Clinton has not traveled to New Hampshire since 2008, but recently visited Iowa, home of the first presidential caucuses, for retiring Sen. Tom Harkin’s annual steak fry. Former President Bill Clinton, whose second place finish in the 1992 primary helped propel him to the nomination, will headline the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s annual dinner in October.
Shaheen, who is serving her first Senate term, faces Republican Scott Brown, a former senator from Massachusetts, in November. She is part of the nation’s only all-female congressional delegation.
Democrats are defending their Senate majority against an onslaught from Republicans, who must gain six seats to claim control of the chamber.
