PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — TBS and the makers of “Cougar Town” say they only briefly considered changing the show’s title with its move to cable TV, but they didn’t want to throw away years of marketing that has given the comedy starring Courteney Cox an identity.
After three seasons on ABC, “Cougar Town” begins its fourth season Tuesday on TBS.
Creator Bill Lawrence doesn’t like the title because it conveys the image of older women chasing young men. Instead, it’s a comedy about friends in their 40s. Cox’s character is now married.
TBS has even run an advertising campaign calling it a funny show with a terrible title.
“We wear it as a badge of honor,” Lawrence said. “I still enjoy mocking it.”
Lawrence was unhappy with ABC for holding the show in limbo before TBS bought it. But since ABC parent Walt Disney Co. still produces the show, he said at a news conference Friday that he wasn’t going to bash his old network.
Before the season premiere, Lawrence and the cast of “Cougar Town” went to bars in different cities to buy people drinks and show them new episodes. To his chagrin, Lawrence said none of the people he bought drinks for was part of the Nielsen Co.'s ratings system.
Lawrence said he hopes the switch to TBS will be seamless and fans of the show won’t notice a difference this season. Actress Busy Philipps became pregnant in real life during filming of the new season, but her character did not become pregnant.
