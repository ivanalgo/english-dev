WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker John Boehner is laying down the law — about the rules of the House.
Boehner took to the podium after a roll call vote Wednesday and pointedly reminded members about a host of standards that sometimes get ignored with lawmakers rushing to votes from all parts of Capitol Hill and beyond.
No selfies in the House chamber. Wear business attire at all times. And whatever else you may be doing, show up to vote within the 15 minutes allotted, Boehner told his colleagues — after he waited several moments for them to quiet down and take their seats.
Aides said Boehner issues a reminder about rules every year, although several lawmakers have been seen posing for smart-phone photos — many of which wind up being posted online on social media — during the State of Union address, Opening Day and other occasions.
The House has 58 freshmen this year, but the speaker’s office said his warning was not aimed at any particular group.
Still, Boehner earned knowing laughs when he pointed out that members should wear appropriate business attire at all times on the House floor, “however brief their appearance on the floor may be. You know who you are.”
The biggest applause came when Boehner urged lawmakers to come to the floor within 15 minutes after a roll call vote is called.
“This has been an ongoing problem and members should make every attempt to be here,” Boehner said.
Left unclear was how Boehner would respond if Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid stepped on the House floor wearing his now-famous shades — a fashion accessory made necessary as Reid recovers from recent eye surgery.
