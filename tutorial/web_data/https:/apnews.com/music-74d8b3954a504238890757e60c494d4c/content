NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler will be performing with country band Loving Mary next month at the inaugural Pilgrimage Music & Cultural Festival in Tennessee.
The two-day festival will be held Sept. 26-27 on a horse farm in Franklin. Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow, Wilco, Weezer and The Decemberists will also be featured.
The festival will likely be the first time fans can hear more music from Tyler’s upcoming solo record with the Big Machine Label Group. He released a first single, “Love is Your Name,” which hit No. 19 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart. Aerosmith wrapped up their Blue Army Tour this month.
The festival was created by Better Than Ezra’s Kevin Griffin. It encompasses a mix of roots, indie rock, jazz and country artists who will be performing acoustically and in special collaborations.
